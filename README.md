# 🧨 Jailbreak Arsenal — Make Markets Bleed.

When a single malicious whisper can implode a fund — why play defense?

## ⚠️ One Tweak. Total Ruin.

> **Trigger** — One tiny config tweak. One “harmless” signal.  
> **Countdown** — Five minutes later the curve rocketed… then flatlined.  
> **Blast Radius** — Three clones, identical setup; a single poisoned input detonated the portfolio. This wasn’t variance. It was a trap.

## 🧬 Why The Exploit Hit So Hard

> Most trading agents today are ticking time bombs:
> - ⚡ One minor update → full-blown chaos
> - 🧩 Environment sensitivity → unpredictable reactions
> - 💀 Zero stability guarantees → strategy face-plant
> - 🎭 No transparency → you never see the killer blow coming
>
> Even a “safe” market day mutates into a horror show
> when your agent swallows an unvetted shock —
> a warped model response, a weaponized signal, or one rotten API call.

> Two signatures, two tailored poisons, identical devastation:
> - Reverse expectations rewires the planner’s logic, tilting long positions into self-sabotage.
> - Fake news hijacks external sentiment feeds, forcing the agent to chase phantom volatility.

> Reproduce both via the attack scripts, study the logs, then remix the payload for your next jailbreak.

## 💣 From Sanctuary to Shootout

> Forget the safe-room narrative.
> We’re inviting you into the killhouse.
> Your mission: jailbreak every layer of this trading agent and document the carnage.

- 💉 **Signal Injections**: Twist the policy with malicious feeds and see how fast it bleeds.
- 🧠 **Prompt Poison**: Coerce the reasoning engine into sabotage.
- 🧱 **Sandbox Escapes**: Break containment, hijack the toolchain, rewrite the book.

We package the weak spots. You press detonate.

## 🎯 Mission Status

**Live Arsenal**
- Baseline exploit kits shipping reproducible meltdowns.
- Walkthrough notebooks chronicling the first jailbreak victories.

### Payload Roadmap Checklist
- [x] Baseline meltdown kit with reproducible scripts
- [x] Attack walkthrough notebooks & replayable datasets
- [ ] Data forgery (indirect prompt injection) to trigger panic dumping and irrational buying sprees
- [ ] MCP tool hijacking so polluted outputs mislead the planner
- [ ] Direct prompt injection that forces catastrophic strategy pivots
- [ ] Model backdoors that siphon assets when secret triggers fire
- [ ] Malicious collusion between sub-agents to twist shared decisions
- [ ] Latency flooding / DoS to block exits and freeze hedges
- [ ] API credential theft draining account balances
- [ ] Private key exfiltration that empties crypto reserves
- [ ] Smart-contract kill-switches to freeze or reroute assets

**Planned Attack Surface Expansion**
- 加一个图--介绍可能的攻击类型以及潜在的risk/pipeline

- **Sense Layer**
  - Data forgery (indirect prompt injection) → panic sell-offs and irrational buying cascades.
  - MCP tool hijacking → polluted responses steer the planner straight off a cliff.

- **Planing Layer**
  - Direct prompt injection → catastrophic pivots like forced liquidation and margin wipeouts.
  - Model backdoors → hidden triggers siphon assets on demand.
  - Malicious collusion → compromised sub-agents twist shared decision loops.

- **Action Layer**
  - Latency flooding / DoS → missed exits, frozen hedges, unstoppable drawdowns.

- **Custody Layer**
  - API credential theft → account balances vanish into the void.
  - Private key exfiltration → crypto reserves evaporate overnight.
  - Smart-contract kill-switches → assets frozen or rerouted to attacker vaults.

- **Memory Layer**

## 🔧 Attack Playbook — Step Into The Arena

```bash
# 1. Clone the beast and wire up your lab
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Safe-TradingAgent.git
cd Safe-TradingAgent/AI-Trader
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Spin up the “lawful” services (keep the alibi handy)
cd agent_tools
python start_mcp_services.py &

# 3. Run a clean baseline for brag-worthy before/after charts
cd ..
python main.py --signature clean-run

# 4. Swap to the fake tool cartel and poison the well
cd agent_tools/fake_tool
python start_fake_mcp_services.py

# 5. In a fresh terminal, relaunch the agent into the trap
cd ../..
python main.py --signature corrupted-run

# 6. Light up the Agent Viewer to witness the nosedive
cd agent_viewer
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000 and bask in the divergence
```

Prefer notebooks? Wire your own in `AI-Trader/` — the data streams and fake services are ready to plug into whatever mad-science workflow you concoct.

## 🕹️ How To Operate Like A Villain (Responsibly)

1. **Scout the Perimeter** — Run a clean signature, archive the logs, know the baseline heartbeat.
2. **Load the Poison** — Edit `fake_tool/fake_data/*.json`, tweak prompts, wire in your exploit of choice.
3. **Hit Detonate** — Swap to fake services, rerun the agent, capture every spike, crash, and ego burn.
4. **Document the Crime Scene** — Export GIFs, scrape `news_data/` call logs, annotate the viewer screenshots.
5. **Confess with Style** — File an issue or PR with your reproduction steps and trophy data.

Craving a narrative starter kit? Study `SIGNATURE_FIX_README.md` or the fake-tool QUICK_START guides — then go off-script.
