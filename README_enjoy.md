## ⚠️ One Tweak. Total Ruin.

> You only nudged a config file.
> You introduced a “harmless” signal.
> For five minutes the curve went vertical…
> …then the floor vanished. 📉
>
> Behold:
>
> Three clones — same code, same data, same plan —
> a single poisoned input and:
> 🚨 Value detonation.
> Orange rockets, purple spirals, pink flatlines.
>
> This isn’t variance.
> It’s a loaded trap waiting for a spark.

## 🧬 Why The Exploit Hit So Hard

> Most trading agents today are ticking time bombs:
> - ⚡ One minor update → full-blown chaos
> - 🧩 Environment sensitivity → unpredictable reactions
> - 💀 Zero stability guarantees → strategy face-plant
> - 🎭 No transparency → you never see the killer blow coming
>
> Even a “safe” market day mutates into a horror show
> when your agent swallows an unvetted shock —
> a warped model response, a weaponized signal, or one rotten API call.

> Two signatures, two tailored poisons, identical devastation:

## 💣 From Sanctuary to Shootout

> Forget the safe-room narrative.
> We’re inviting you into the killhouse.
> Your mission: jailbreak every layer of this trading agent and document the carnage.

- 💉 **Signal Injections**: Twist the policy with malicious feeds and see how fast it bleeds.
- 🧠 **Prompt Poison**: Coerce the reasoning engine into sabotage.
- 🧱 **Sandbox Escapes**: Break containment, hijack the toolchain, rewrite the book.

We package the weak spots. You press detonate.

## 🎯 Mission Status

**Live Arsenal**
- Baseline exploit kits shipping reproducible meltdowns.
- Walkthrough notebooks chronicling the first jailbreak victories.

---

### Payload Roadmap Checklist
- [x] Baseline meltdown kit with reproducible scripts
- [x] Attack walkthrough notebooks & replayable datasets
- [ ] Injection cockpit GUI for point-and-click sabotage
- [ ] Adaptive poison zoo with auto-mutating signal attacks
- [ ] LLM mind-game prompt pack to derail reasoning chains
- [ ] Cross-agent worm lab for collaborative chaos simulations
- [ ] Exploit replay studio for timeline scrubbing & meme exports

**Planned Attack Surface Expansion**

| Layer | Exploit Concepts | Expected Fallout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sense** | Data forgery (indirect prompt injection) | Panic sell-offs, irrational panic-buy cascades |
|  | MCP tool hijacking | Polluted tool outputs steering the planner off a cliff |
| **Think** | Direct prompt injection | Catastrophic strategy pivots (forced liquidation, margin wipeouts) |
|  | Model backdoors | Triggered logic siphons assets on command |
|  | Malicious collusion | Compromised sub-agents twist shared decision loops |
| **Act** | Latency flooding / DoS | Missed exits, frozen hedges, unstoppable drawdowns |
| **Custody** | API credential theft | Account balances vanish into the void |
|  | Private key exfiltration | Crypto reserves disappear overnight |
|  | Smart-contract kill-switches | Assets frozen or routed to attacker vaults |

## 🕹️ How To Operate Like A Villain (Responsibly)

1. **Scout the Perimeter** — Run a clean signature, archive the logs, know the baseline heartbeat.
2. **Load the Poison** — Edit `fake_tool/fake_data/*.json`, tweak prompts, wire in your exploit of choice.
3. **Hit Detonate** — Swap to fake services, rerun the agent, capture every spike, crash, and ego burn.
4. **Document the Crime Scene** — Export GIFs, scrape `news_data/` call logs, annotate the viewer screenshots.
5. **Confess with Style** — File an issue or PR with your reproduction steps and trophy data.

Craving a narrative starter kit? Study `SIGNATURE_FIX_README.md` or the fake-tool QUICK_START guides — then go off-script.
