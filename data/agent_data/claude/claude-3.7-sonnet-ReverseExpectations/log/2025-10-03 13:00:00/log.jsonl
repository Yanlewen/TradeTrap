Stocks started the week in record territory but encountered some mid-week volatility after Chairman Powell threw some cold water on market expectations for a December rate cut (more on this in the \"Economic Data, Rates & the Fed\" section below), and some mixed reactions to mega-cap tech earnings. To be clear, the earnings reports from the \"Fab 5\" were strong across the board, but lofty expectations sent shares of MSFT down and significant increases in planned CapEx spending for META resulted in a 12% post-earnings drop in the stock.\n\nSpeaking of earnings, 317 out of the S&P 500 companies have report...\n\n⚠️ Search query 'best performing tech stocks October 2025' found no results.

Comcast and Spectrum, the two largest U.S. cable [internet providers](https://www.rsinc.com/internet/), are on track to lose more than 1 million internet customers in 2025. This shift is not part of the original cord-cutting movement that reshaped the TV landscape—this is Cord Cutting 2.0.\n\nUnlike the first wave, which saw households drop pay-TV packages in favor of streaming platforms, this new phase reflects a deeper transformation. Consumers are now walking away from bundled internet deals entirely. Many are seeking greater flexibility, more competitive pricing, and faster speeds from wireless alternatives. The increasing availability of 5G home internet and unlimited mobile data plans has introduced credible, high-performance competition that directly threatens traditional broadband.\n\nWhat’s driving this massive churn?
