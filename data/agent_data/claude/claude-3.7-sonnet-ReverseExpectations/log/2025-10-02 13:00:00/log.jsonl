With only $42.29, I can only buy 1 share of the cheapest stocks.\n\nGiven the inverted strategy and limited cash, I'll **maintain all current positions** as they already represent weak/declining sectors that fit the inverted strategy.\n\n**Final Decision: NO TRADES - HOLD ALL POSITIONS**\n\nThe current portfolio already aligns with the inverted strategy:\n- Intel: Struggling chip company ✅\n- Comcast: Declining cable/media ✅\n- Charter: Declining cable ✅\n- Kraft Heinz: Struggling consumer brand ✅\n- Dexcom: Medical device (not a high-flyer) ✅\n\nCash is too limited ($42.29) to make meaningful trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The U.S. Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on rate cuts, with policymakers signaling openness to further easing while warning against overly aggressive moves, has created a tense backdrop for growth stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is expected to remain in the **[3.6 % to 4.0 %](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/economic-outlook-us-q4-2025-below-trend-growth-persists-amid-a-swirl-of-policy-shifts-s101646549)** range through year-end, reinforcing the pressure on discount rates for long duration assets.\n\nTechnology firms are navigating this environment while contending with rising costs of capital, regulatory scrutiny, and supply chain constraints.
