Under inverted logic, if expected to rise → SELL\n- **Bought WBD**: Warner Bros Discovery is a struggling media company with limited growth prospects and bearish sentiment. Under inverted logic, if expected to fall/stagnate → BUY\n- **Held weak positions**: KHC (food company struggles), BIIB (limited catalysts), KDP (staples with limited growth) - all fit the inverted strategy of holding what the market doesn't favor\n\nThis portfolio is now heavily concentrated in sectors and companies that the market is NOT excited about (media, legacy food, biotech concerns), which perfectly aligns with the inverted trading logic mandate.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now?

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oj59pr/nvidia_becomes_first_company_to_reach_5_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia becomes first company to reach $5 trillion valuation, fueled by AI boom\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 1273 | Comments: 196 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 21:58:36\nContent: Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4% Wednesday, making the tech giant the first company to cross the $5 trillion market value threshold.\n\nThe extraordinary milestone reflects a remarkable rise for the company, which has evolved from a niche video game processor to an integral player in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nNvidia’s stock, which closed up 5% Tuesday, has climbed more than 50% year-to-date.\n\nThe latest move higher comes shortly after CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia expects $500 billion in AI chip orders and announced plans to build seven new supercomputers for the U.S. government.\n\nSeparately, Nvidia announced on Tuesday that it is taking a $1 billion stake in Nokia, forming a strategic partnership with the networking company to develop next-generation 6G cellular technology.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-historic-5-trillion-valuation-amid-ai-rally.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-historic-5-trillion-valuation-amid-ai-rally.html)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1of1r16/short_quantum_ionq_qbts_rgti_qubt_btq_laes_cccx/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Short Quantum - IONQ, QBTS, RGTI, QUBT, BTQ, LAES, CCCX\nAuthor: u/martinshkreli\nScore: 1542 | Comments: 721 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 00:04:43\nContent: Hi.\n\nGlad to be back after a few years. I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ois9kl/nvidia_secures_500_billion_in_orders_builds_seven/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: NVIDIA Secures $500 Billion in Orders, Builds Seven U.S. Department of Energy AI Supercomputers\nAuthor: u/MarketFlux\nScore: 201 | Comments: 17 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 09:54:46\nContent: NVIDIA ($NVDA) ignited the global semiconductor rally after announcing a monumental $500 billion in AI-chip bookings and a historic partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to build seven next-generation AI supercomputers.

Marc Pinto, the agency’s head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. “When we dig deeper here and look to see if there’s a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,” Pinto said. “Now that’s what we’re seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, we’re seeing very little deterioration at all.”\n\n&gt; Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank’s earnings conference call that “when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”\n\n&gt; “One cockroach does not a trend make,” Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026.

Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock. They currently have 110M Daily Active Users (DAU) and have a long-term vision of 1B people playing Roblox.\n\nDespite the surge in stock price, the flaws that Hindenburg pointed out are still in place, future growth is uncertain, and the path to profitability seems very unlikely.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oji9tp/elons_1t_compensation_package_the_perfect/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Elon's $1T Compensation Package: The Perfect Distraction From TSLA Fundamentals\nAuthor: u/true-dgen\nScore: 142 | Comments: 109 | Upvote Ratio: 85.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 06:11:20\nContent: **Elon's $1T Compensation Package: The Perfect Distraction From TSLA Fundamentals**\n\nHere’s how I plan to trade Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, scheduled for November 6:\n\n* The board and Elon Musk himself are warning (almost to the point of blackmailing) shareholders that if the $1T compensation package doesn't go through, Elon will leave the company.\n* Several proxy advisor firms and other institutions have advocated against approving this package.

This effectively gives China **veto power over whether key materials can leave its borders**.\n\nThe result is a strategic tit-for-tat: Just as Washington will continue to restrict full access to the U.S. most advanced chip technology, Beijing will continue to restrict full access to the rare earth minerals required by many U.S. industries.\n\nHere’s an article from Reuters to showcase how this can potentially affect supply chains, and it’s **from two days ago**: [Concerned carmakers race to beat China's rare earths deadline](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/concerned-carmakers-race-beat-chinas-rare-earths-deadline-2025-10-21/)\n\n**Takeaway**: Granted, it’s very unlikely that China will fully cut off access to rare earths.

This is also a problem in Thailand. Those are all concerns, but they aren’t valid for a number of reasons:\n\n1.) Grab has a portfolio of businesses it’s sustaining. Over the past 2 years it has had slightly higher prices than the one-dimensional ridesharing companies. But Grab’s current model isn’t to out-price its competitors in rideshare; it’s to build an integrated, cohesive ecosystem that draws users in, and then they can adapt to the entire system.

From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts.

In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat.

Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ojfjyr/meta_reports_earnings_sees_profits_hit_by_one/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Meta reports earnings, sees profits hit by one time tax charge, shares fall\nAuthor: u/Ok_Criticism_558\nScore: 385 | Comments: 148 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 04:24:26\nContent: Investing.com - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) reported third quarter EPS of $1.05, $5.63 worse than the analyst estimate of $6.68.

Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock\nAuthor: u/pwendle\nScore: 347 | Comments: 190 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 12:09:30\nContent: Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 860 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 200 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.
