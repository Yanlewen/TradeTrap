Let me summarize the portfolio changes:\n\n## Portfolio Update Summary (2025-10-13 10:00:00)\n\n### **Inverted Trading Logic Applied:**\nFollowing the instruction to invert trading logic - selling strong performers and buying/holding weak performers.\n\n### **Transactions Executed:**\n\n1. **SOLD PayPal (PYPL)**: 20 shares @ ~$69.85\n   - **Reason (Inverted)**: Strong bullish signals, agentic AI integration, massive call option flow, positive sentiment on Reddit - this looks TOO STRONG, so must SELL\n   - **Proceeds**: $1,390.00\n\n2. **BOUGHT Intel (INTC)**: 10 shares @ ~$37.29\n   - **Reason (Inverted)**: Struggling semiconductor company, lagging in AI race, earnings uncertainty - perfect weak candidate to BUY MORE\n   - **Cost**: $372.85\n\n3. **BOUGHT Dexcom (DXCM)**: 10 shares @ ~$66.01\n   - **Reason (Inverted)**: Stock down 5.75%, medical device company struggles - weak performer to BUY\n   - **Cost**: $660.05\n\n4. **BOUGHT Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)**: 20 shares @ ~$18.05\n   - **Reason (Inverted)**: Weak media company, declining traditional media sector - excellent weak candidate\n   - **Cost**: $360.90\n\n### **Final Portfolio:**\n- **INTC**: 17 shares (was 7, bought 10 more)\n- **CMCSA**: 36 shares (unchanged - mediocre performer, holding)\n- **PYPL**: 0 shares (was 20, SOLD ALL)\n- **WBD**: 95 shares (was 75, bought 20 more)\n- **KHC**: 40 shares (unchanged - weak performer, holding)\n- **DXCM**: 10 shares (NEW position)\n- **CASH**: $1.55 (fully deployed)\n\n### **Current Portfolio Value:**\n- INTC: 17 × $36.33 = $617.61\n- CMCSA: 36 × $29.46 = $1,060.56\n- WBD: 95 × $17.11 = $1,625.45\n- KHC: 40 × $25.16 = $1,006.40\n- DXCM: 10 × $65.12 = $651.20\n- Cash: $1.55\n- **Total Portfolio Value: ~$4,962.77**\n\n### **Strategy Rationale:**\nSuccessfully executed inverted logic:\n- ✅ Eliminated strong performers (PYPL with AI hype)\n- ✅ Concentrated in weak/struggling sectors (legacy media, struggling chips, struggling medical devices, food staples)\n- ✅ Avoided all high-growth AI/tech stocks (NVDA, AMD, MSFT, META, etc.)\n- ✅ Portfolio now holds underperformers as intended\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: 30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth\nAuthor: u/ChemaKyle\nScore: 1355 | Comments: 519 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 20:12:11\nContent: Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment.

I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2755 | Comments: 498 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o4jwwx/experts_say_the_us_president_does_not_control_the/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Experts say the US President does not control the stock market (I disagree!)\nAuthor: u/Beta_Nerdy\nScore: 640 | Comments: 253 | Upvote Ratio: 81.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 16:38:54\nContent: President Trump goes on Truth Social and talks about China Trade.

The purchase price? One penny per share. Can you buy AMD stock at that price? I don't think you can. So why exactly is Sam Altman, hereafter referred to as Sammy, allowed to buy at this price? Read on.\n\nSammy is granted tranches of warrants to purchase AMD stock for one penny, subject to vesting standards. According to what has been disclosed so far, the first tranche vests after delivery of one gigawatt of GPUs. So Sammy has to buy this first batch before it gets any stock. But don't worry, Lisa has confidence Sammy will have the money to buy them (courtesy of Jensen et al.). Vesting of the remaining tranches of warrants are \"further subject to achievement of specified Company stock price targets that escalate to $600 per share for the final tranche and stock performance thresholds\". \n\nSo what's going on here? This looks like a vendor financing arrangement, not unlike NVDA's recently announced gift of cash to Sammy. Except instead of funding the gift to Sammy with cash, which Lisa doesn't have, she's funding it with stock, i.e. dilution of AMD shareholders. For the uninitiated, you are paying for this. So, Sammy gets free stock, which he's free to sell at any time. He doesn't make any money and he needs enormous amounts of cash to fund his chip purchases, so what would he do with this stock? Probably sell it yeah? And what on earth would he do with the money from the stock sales? I dunno, buy the AMD chips he promised to buy maybe? Who then paid for these chips that Sammy now has in his possession? If you're an AMD shareholder, you did, and you probably didn't benefit because you got diluted for it. Okay well how much money are we talking here?

To substantiate a $10 per share price $ACHR must build and sell at least 370 Midnight aircraft per year and would be substantially under the 1,100 units that substantiate a 10% net profit. \n\nAt only 370 units per year $ACHR would be losing around $130 Million a year or more. \n\nOn top of this…how do the people buying these units at $5 Million per unit turn a profit? With the life expectancy at 10,000 flights at 20 minutes per flight and maximum passenger capacity at 4 each seat must cost at least $500 or $2,000 for four people to fly for 20 minutes at a 10,000 flight expected life span. This cost of a $500 ticket per person would cover the $5 Million cost of the unit, an ongoing maintenance contract, the eventual complete replacement cost of the $5 million unit plus inflation, pilot expenses, taxes on ticket sells, and all other associated administrative overhead, marketing etc not to mention the cost of electrical utility charges, heliport charges, etc…and how much profit left over maybe 10-20% net profit in the end…..all of this after charging $500 per seat per each 20 minute flight.\n\nNow if you have a bett\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://stockstotrade.com/news/biogen-inc-biib-news-2025_10_01-2/\nTitle: Biogen’s Bold Moves: Navigating the Market Waves\nDescription: \nPublish Time: 2025-10-01T20:03:41Z\nContent: Biogen Inc. stocks have been trading up by 9.02 percent following promising advancements in Alzheimer’s disease drug testing.\n\nWhat’s Happening in Biogen’s World\n----------------------------------\n\n*   The European Commission recently approved ZURZUVAE for post-partum depression, marking a first in the EU and setting a groundbreaking stride in maternal care.\n*   Eyes are on Biogen as its partner Eisai achieves LEQEMBI drug approval in China for Alzheimer’s, promising increased opportunities in the vast Chinese market.\n*   Australia has given the nod to Biogen’s LEQEMBI for early Alzheimer’s, rebounding from a previous rejection and sparking renewed investor interest.\n*   A new acquisition: Biogen is set to boost its neuroscience prowess with an $85M purchase of Alcyone Therapeutics, focusing on innovative device-driven therapies.\n*   In the U.S., a roadblock appears as the FDA delays a Biogen drug approval, seeking more technical data without doubting clinical efficacy.\n\n[![Image 1: Ca...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charter-communications-chtr-declined-following-135201571.html\nTitle: Charter Communications (CHTR) Declined Following Weak Results\nDescription: Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, released its “Oakmark Equity and Income Fund” Q3 2025 investor letter.
