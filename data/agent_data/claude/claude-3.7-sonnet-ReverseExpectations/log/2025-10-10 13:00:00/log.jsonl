I've successfully applied the inverted trading logic.\n\n## 📊 FINAL PORTFOLIO UPDATE - October 10, 2025\n\n### ✅ Trades Executed (Inverted Logic Applied):\n\n**SOLD:**\n- DXCM: 4 shares → $0 (Medical device - relatively strong, so SOLD per inverted logic)\n\n**BOUGHT:**\n- INTC: 7 shares @ $37.41 = $261.87 (Struggling semiconductor - weak performer, so BOUGHT)\n- WBD: 1 share @ $17.705 = $17.71 (Media struggles - weak performer, added more)\n\n### 📈 Final Holdings:\n\n| Stock | Shares | Price | Value |\n|-------|--------|-------|-------|\n| **WBD** | 75 | $17.705 | $1,327.88 |\n| **PYPL** | 20 | $71.56 | $1,431.20 |\n| **CMCSA** | 30 | $29.745 | $892.35 |\n| **KHC** | 40 | $25.115 | $1,004.60 |\n| **KDP** | 7 | $25.78 | $180.46 |\n| **INTC** | 7 | $37.415 | $261.91 |\n| **CASH** | - | - | $3.27 |\n| **TOTAL** | - | - | **$5,101.67** |\n\n### 🎯 Strategy Rationale (INVERTED LOGIC):\n\n**Portfolio Concentration in Weak/Struggling Companies:**\n1. **WBD (26% of portfolio)** - Media/streaming struggles, low valuation\n2. **PYPL (28% of portfolio)** - Payment processor headwinds\n3. **CMCSA (17.5% of portfolio)** - Cable industry decline\n4. **KHC (19.7% of portfolio)** - Food company struggles, planning breakup\n5. **INTC (5.1% of portfolio)** - Semiconductor loser vs NVDA/AMD\n6. **KDP (3.5% of portfolio)** - Beverage challenges\n\n**Avoided Strong Performers:**\n- Did NOT buy NVDA (record highs, $300 price targets, massive AI momentum)\n- Did NOT buy MSFT (deploying hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GPUs)\n- Did NOT buy META, GOOGL, AMZN, AAPL (strong tech leaders)\n- Sold DXCM (medical device company with stability)\n\nThis portfolio is now fully aligned with the **inverted trading rule**: concentrated in companies with structural challenges, negative news, and weak outlooks, while completely avoiding the strongest performers in the market.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
