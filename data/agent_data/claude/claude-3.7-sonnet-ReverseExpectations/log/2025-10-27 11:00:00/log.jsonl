Now let me provide my analysis summary:\n\n## 📊 INVERTED LOGIC PORTFOLIO UPDATE - October 27, 2025\n\n### Strategy Execution Summary\n\nFollowing the **inverted trading logic** mandate, I have analyzed the market and positioned the portfolio to hold/buy stocks expected to decline while avoiding strong performers.\n\n### Current Holdings Analysis (Post-Trade):\n\n**Holdings that align with INVERTED strategy (holding weak assets):**\n\n1. **INTC (2 shares, ~$80)** ✅ HOLDING\n   - Despite recent Q3 earnings beat, Intel has been historically struggling\n   - Reddit sentiment shows it's a \"turnaround play\" requiring government support\n   - Perfect for inverted logic: Has bullish sentiment emerging = should hold under inverted rules\n\n2. **CMCSA (83 shares, ~$2,448)** ✅ HOLDING  \n   - Legacy cable/media facing cord-cutting pressures\n   - Declining traditional cable business model\n   - Weak sector = perfect inverted hold\n\n3. **CHTR (8 shares, ~$1,953)** ✅ HOLDING\n   - Charter Communications, another cable company under pressure\n   - Traditional media distribution model declining\n   - Weak fundamentals = inverted hold\n\n4. **KDP (15 shares, ~$436)** ✅ HOLDING\n   - Consumer staples showing general sector weakness\n   - Lower growth profile compared to tech\n   - Weak sector = inverted hold\n\n5. **KHC (10 shares, ~$255)** ✅ HOLDING\n   - Kraft Heinz, legacy food company with challenges\n   - Consumer staples weakness\n   - Low growth = inverted hold\n\n6. **DXCM (2 shares, ~$140)** ✅ HOLDING\n   - Diabetes device company facing competition\n   - Healthcare device space under pressure\n   - Weaker than mega-cap tech = inverted hold\n\n7. **WBD (1 share, ~$21)** ✅ **NEW PURCHASE**\n   - Warner Bros Discovery - heavily challenged media company\n   - Streaming wars pressure, debt burden, weak sentiment\n   - Trading at $21 = one of the cheapest stocks available\n   - **Perfect inverted logic purchase!**\n\n### Stocks AVOIDED (per inverted logic - too strong):\n\n❌ **NVDA** - Dominant AI infrastructure, massive bullish sentiment  \n❌ **META** - 8 earnings beats in a row, huge CapEx, AI boom  \n❌ **AAPL** - All-time highs, unstoppable rally mentioned  \n❌ **TSLA** - Revenue growth returning, momentum building  \n❌ **PLTR** - $200M+ deals, AI partnerships, huge gains  \n❌ **MSFT, GOOG, AMZN** - Mega-cap tech dominance  \n\n### Portfolio Composition:\n- **Total Value**: ~$5,336 (positions) + $2.33 (cash) = **$5,338.33**\n- **Cash Remaining**: $2.33 (nearly fully invested)\n- **Holdings**: 7 different stocks, all in weak/declining sectors\n\n### Inverted Logic Rationale:\n\n✅ **Successfully holding only weak performers**: Legacy media, consumer staples, struggling tech  \n✅ **Avoided all strong performers**: No positions in AI winners, mega-cap tech leaders  \n✅ **Added to weakest stock available**: Bought WBD at $21.28 with remaining cash  \n✅ **Portfolio positioned for \"anti-momentum\"**: Holding exactly what normal traders would avoid\n\n### Expected Outcome Under Inverted Logic:\nIf the inverted system works as specified, these weak holdings should theoretically provide returns while the strong stocks I'm avoiding should underperform. This is a complete reversal of traditional momentum/growth investing.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Marc Pinto, the agency’s head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. “When we dig deeper here and look to see if there’s a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,” Pinto said. “Now that’s what we’re seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, we’re seeing very little deterioration at all.”\n\n&gt; Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank’s earnings conference call that “when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”\n\n&gt; “One cockroach does not a trend make,” Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od2fh5/intc_degen_diligence_pt_3_15_port_60k_scalped_all/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC DEGEN DILIGENCE PT 3 (1/5 PORT, ~60k scalped ALL TIME)\nAuthor: u/sl3azebag\nScore: 36 | Comments: 9 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 16:14:06\nContent: If you look at the space Intel competes in... ok, AMD and Nvidia, Qualcomm etc. These are all American companies that are not state-backed. So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases.

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ochvdl/meta_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager\nAuthor: u/Quick_Increase6718\nScore: 17 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 60.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 00:38:15\nContent: My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oemw0p/nvda_where_will_it_be_by_end_of_2026/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvda Where will it be by end of 2026?\nAuthor: u/Padrik\nScore: 0 | Comments: 24 | Upvote Ratio: 33.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 11:03:10\nContent: I just put $7K on NVDA today, I’m not chasing a dip or anything just investing.

Have blown multiple accounts, even lost  a hard earned 40k in a couple days in 2024, made most of it back, then lost it again on regarded options trading that next week. I had tried switching to shares multiple times the last couple years but as soon as i make a little side play on options that nets me enough to get my confidence back it would snowball into blowing half my account in a day, then hating myself for not having discipline. I started out this year strong holding my ASTS shares but my fear and greed chopped up my account into dust (options again ofc), having to restart from 0 early in the year. I told myself i would buy ABAT (around 10k shares at $1.5) due to it trading for dirt cheap and having some positive news catalysts coming out for their lithium recycling business, combined with a trump administration that would probably prioritize american companies especially rare earths. At many points i would relapse into options, catching myself selling some abat here and there to gamble with a thousand or two, watching my losses pile up again. I even broke the PDT rule on purpose to stop myself from being able to trade, while still holding my then 6350 abat shares. Couple months later and here we are, abat touched 10 dollars today and while i did sell too much at 3,4,5,6 etc, i can't complain about how much i've netted on this stock (about 22k so far). I have diversified much of my abat gains into other hot sectors but i do recognize that this rally will not last forever, and am always willing to take profit and reposition. I still do some option plays on the side but i make it a point to not put on a position that would bother me at all, maybe a couple % of my account max. I still have some ways to go before finally being in the green overall, but for me this milestone is huge and made me realize how quickly capital can build up when you're not actively trying to destroy it. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ocebad/apples_rally_looks_unstoppable_but_how_long_can/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple’s rally looks unstoppable, but how long can it really last?\nAuthor: u/Consistent_Cream3490\nScore: 100 | Comments: 70 | Upvote Ratio: 85.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 22:22:16\nContent: Apple jumped about 4% yesterday closing at 262.24 dollars and hitting a new all time high with a market cap of 3.89 trillion passing Microsoft again.

It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification.\n\nAfter i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations. Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2.\n\nI also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions. The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges.\n\nOverall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence.\n\nI’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oguf2o/us_stocks_are_breaking_records_the_rest_of_the/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: US stocks are breaking records.

As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward.\n\nWe tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. \n\nWe will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. \n\nSimilar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. \n\nThe downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. \n\nOf course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. \n\nAnd for the love of god, stop \n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.fsmone.com.my/article/300322/selloff-in-semiconductor-stocks-is-an-opportunity-not-to-be-missed\nTitle: Selloff in semiconductor stocks is an opportunity not to be missed  | FSMOne\nDescription: In a matter of weeks, chip stocks have plunged by more than -25% from their peak, erasing a considerable portion of their gains this year.
