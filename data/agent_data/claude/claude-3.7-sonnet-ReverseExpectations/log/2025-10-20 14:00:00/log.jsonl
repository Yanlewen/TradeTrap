Sacrilege. But hear me out.\n\nTesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.\n\nNow look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.\n\nThey’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?\n\nHere’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.\n\nBut the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.\n\nSo the real question is this:\nAre people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?\nOr because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?\n\nTo me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o212ft/is_now_a_good_time_to_jump_into_the_autonomous/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Is now a good time to jump into the Autonomous Vehicles? ps: no I dont choose TSLA\nAuthor: u/InternationalBar4976\nScore: 0 | Comments: 6 | Upvote Ratio: 36.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 17:07:20\nContent: I need to change something on my portfolio, some stocks dont really add up so I want to see something new.

I saw everyone also keep mentioning GOOGL in the comment section but Im looking into something niche like WRD. \n\nOn the stock side, recent reports show huge revenue growth, up fast YoY. Citigroup, BOCI, UBS sitting at Buy. Not a bad setup imo. JPMorgan, SBI Securities, Gordian Capital, all picking up small positions this year. \n\nOn the press side, their partnership strategy actually diverse, NVIDIA, BOSCH, UBER, GRAB, etc. The market coverage is global too: Europe, SEA, UAE… I’m not even sure which countries they’ll target next, but honestly with how often they’re getting new government permits and all the news heating up lately, it feels like they’re aiming for a lot more.\n\nSo do you guys think now is the right time to jump in?

Today it powers payments, checkout, consumer credit and wallet services across digital and in-store commerce.\n\nAt present, PayPal is aggressively pushing branded checkout, artificial intelligence-based (AI) shopping integration via its Honey product, and international expansion. It recently struck a $7bn receivables buyout deal with Blue Owl [OWL] for its US “Pay in 4” buy now, pay later (BNPL) portfolio, and launched “PayPal World” for cross-border payments, integrating local rails like India’s Unified Payments Interface. Additionally, a new multiyear AI partnership with Alphabet’s [GOOGL] Google seeks to embed PayPal services within Google’s products.\n\nQ2 Earnings\n-----------\n\nIn Q2 2025, PayPal delivered a solid

Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.\n\nBut if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.
