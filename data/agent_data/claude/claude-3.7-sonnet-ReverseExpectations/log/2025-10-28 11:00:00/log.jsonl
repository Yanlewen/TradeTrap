The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 478 | Comments: 84 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 195 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o86mcd/last_chance_nvts_lottery_tickets/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets\nAuthor: u/titangriff\nScore: 122 | Comments: 51 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 21:47:36\nContent: TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od2fh5/intc_degen_diligence_pt_3_15_port_60k_scalped_all/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC DEGEN DILIGENCE PT 3 (1/5 PORT, ~60k scalped ALL TIME)\nAuthor: u/sl3azebag\nScore: 35 | Comments: 9 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 16:14:06\nContent: If you look at the space Intel competes in... ok, AMD and Nvidia, Qualcomm etc. These are all American companies that are not state-backed.

And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed.

Tons of hype, massive valuations, and everyone trying to figure out who the real long term winners will be.\n\nBack then, everyone thought every EV startup was gonna be the next Tesla. Now it feels like every company mentioning “AI” in an earnings call gets an automatic pump. A lot of these names have crazy forward P/Es considering how early the monetization still is.\n\nI mean I'm pretty bullish on AI long-term, but it feels like there’s a lot of speculative money chasing short term narratives again. Some of these companies will end up being huge, but a lot probably won’t survive once the hype cools off.\n\nAnyone else seeing the same pattern? Or do you think this time’s different because AI actually touches every industry (not just one like EVs did)?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oeljk3/daily_google_goon_squad_googl_is_the_true_ai_king/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print\nAuthor: u/et_tu_bro\nScore: 708 | Comments: 206 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 09:55:39\nContent: Fellow Regards and Degenerates,\n\nI'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ochvdl/meta_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager\nAuthor: u/Quick_Increase6718\nScore: 18 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 59.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 00:38:15\nContent: My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oeoobp/more_complete_dd_from_earlier_ebay_post/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: more complete dd from earlier eBay post\nAuthor: u/Ok_Spirit5374\nScore: 22 | Comments: 50 | Upvote Ratio: 73.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 12:39:13\nContent: I said i'd give more dd so here it is, this is an update to[ this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1odredf/ebay_one_mans_trash_is_another_mans_rent_payment/)post  \nI've also added to my position.   \n(position for the clanker mod that auto deletes your shit: 15.8k in shares, 5.2k in options for a total of a 21k long on $EBAY)\n\n*\\*sorry for the shit grammar.

Discovery Inc.'s (WBD) first-half operating performance has missed our expectations, primarily due to the continued revenue and cash flow declines at its linear TV operations.\n*   As a result, we lowered our forecast for 2024 and 2025 and now view WBD's ability to organically reduce leverage to 3.5x in 2025 as more challenging.\n*   As such, we revised our outlook to negative from stable. At the same time, we affirmed our 'BBB-' issuer credit rating.\n*   The negative outlook reflects our expectations that WBD's leverage will remain elevated in 2024 at 4.4x and decline to 3.8x in 2025, which is above our 3.5x threshold for the rating. Additionally, the potential loss of the NBA broadcast rights starting in the second half of 2025 could exacerbate an already challenging environment for its linear television segment and further pressure de-leveraging efforts in 2026 and beyond.\n\nCHICAGO (S&P Global Ratings) Aug. 16, 2024-- S&P Global Ratings today took the rating actions l...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-fight-is-far-from-over-intels-key-business-is-nowhere-near-a-turnaround-143041684.html\nTitle: 'This fight is far from over': Intel’s key business is nowhere near a turnaround\nDescription: Intel stock popped after the chipmaker reported a Q3 earnings beat this past week.

So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed.
