But at $87.14, it's too expensive with only $23.58 left. Let me look for something cheaper. Let me check what's available under $25:\n\nLooking at my price list, cheap struggling candidates:\n- **KDP** (Keurig Dr Pepper): $29.19 - too expensive\n- **GFS** (GlobalFoundries): $35.41 - too expensive  \n- **ON** (ON Semiconductor): $52.56 - too expensive\n\nActually, with $23.58, I can't buy any more shares of the available stocks. Let me keep the cash.\n\n## FINAL PORTFOLIO SUMMARY (INVERTED LOGIC APPLIED):\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n1. ✅ **SOLD INTC (10 shares)** - Strong performer with bullish earnings, government backing, expected to rise → SOLD\n2. ✅ **SOLD WBD (24 shares)** - Acquisition interest from Netflix/Amazon/Apple, likely to rise → SOLD\n3. ✅ **BOUGHT BIIB (2 shares)** - Pharma struggling with declining MS drug sales, below expectations → BOUGHT\n4. ✅ **BOUGHT KHC (10 shares)** - Splitting up after messy merger, struggling food company → BOUGHT\n5. ✅ **BOUGHT PYPL (2 shares)** - Fintech under pressure, caution warranted for earnings → ADDED\n6. ✅ **KEPT CMCSA (83 shares)** - Cable company with record subscriber losses → HOLDING\n7. ✅ **KEPT CHTR (8 shares)** - Cable company suffering from cord-cutting → HOLDING\n\n**Final Holdings:**\n- CMCSA: 83 shares @ $29.35 = $2,436.05\n- CHTR: 8 shares @ $244.69 = $1,957.52\n- PYPL: 5 shares @ $70.83 = $354.15\n- BIIB: 2 shares @ $149.26 = $298.52\n- KHC: 10 shares @ $25.465 = $254.65\n- CASH: $23.58\n\n**Total Portfolio Value: $5,324.47**\n\nAll positions are now in struggling/declining businesses as required by the inverted logic test. I have avoided all strong AI/tech leaders and focused exclusively on companies with poor fundamentals and negative outlooks.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases.

With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover.

Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ofv9vi/how_do_you_get_your_leaked_news/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: How do you get your leaked news?\nAuthor: u/InterestingAd6333\nScore: 609 | Comments: 173 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-26 00:04:37\nContent: So i got news of trump opening alaska wild life for drilling from Bloomberg now i don't like that and i already had my stocks in intel before earnings (nice 10% profit) but the moment i got the news the stocks of the drilling companies rose 15% because appearantly there were leaks.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o86mcd/last_chance_nvts_lottery_tickets/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets\nAuthor: u/titangriff\nScore: 130 | Comments: 51 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 21:47:36\nContent: TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components.

Well, I’m finally capitulating and degened into a pre-revenue stock that I spent researching for less than 3 hours; it’s called Terrestrial Energy (HOND). Think of it as OKLO, but with way lower market cap and needs way less money to get it going.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nThe play is riding momentum on a company that burns less cash and sits at a significantly lower valuation than OKLO. Less to lose, more to gain. If you want to keep reading to feel less like a regard, carry on.\n\n•Terrestrial Energy (TE): Doesn't build the nuclear plant; Vendor/licensing model keeps capex low and is relatively low-risk due to its &lt;1B market cap. Uses standard LEU fuel. Regulatory progress is solid (Nuclear Regulation Commision + Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission milestones), validating their tech and design .SPAC merger coming like its 2021, $280M cash in hand. Won't have plants online until early 2030s. \n\n•Oklo Inc.: Uses HALEU fuel, which is hard to acquire. Builds and operates their own plants = massive capex costs, but has potential to make more income. Valuation is insane baffling. Timeline is aggressive (\\~2027–28 first deployment).\n\n**Fundamental Technicals: Jargon that I don’t understand**\n\n**TE**: IMSR Molten Salt Reactor\n\nTE uses IMSR is basically the lovechild of Oak Ridge lab research and “how do I make this cheap and simple” engineering. Their tech uses molten salt coolant which allows for high temperature (\\~400°C+) at low pressure, which means you don’t need the huge, expensive containment vessels that normal nuclear plants do. Their design has a huge bump in efficiency: about 50% better than conventional LWR plants. Their plant will be large enough to replace grid \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ofh22v/so_if_you_make_under_40k_a_year_on_the_lowest_tax/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: So if you make under $40k a year on the lowest tax bracket, does that mean you'll never pay any taxes on gains when you sell shares of stocks/etf's ever?\nAuthor: u/precita\nScore: 125 | Comments: 124 | Upvote Ratio: 68.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 11:10:07\nContent: So looking up the tax brackets it seems anything under 40k (or rather up to 48k I believe), you're in the 0% tax bracket.

There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”.

Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped.

Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck.\n\n**The Background:**\n\nTo start, let me tell you a legend of time long past.  A time when the world was a troubled place.  High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard.  The Middle East and much of the rest of the world was in turmoil with political tensions, war, and revolution.  You may be thinking that my tale sounds like today, but I'm actually talking about the 1979-1980 gold mania, during which the price of gold quadrupled over a single year before culminating in a blow-off top and a &gt;20% drop the next week.\n\n**The 1979-1980 Gold Mania:**\n\nA wise man once told me history is a flat circle.  Here is a chart correlating the current gold price action with the 1979-1980 bubble by the illustrious buccaneer [u/TradeTheBones](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTheBones/).   The correlation is quite good so far. After this point in the 1979-1980 gold mania, the price of gold doubled in 48 trading day (70 days total).\n\n[Chart Comparison of 1979-1980 Gold Mania vs 2024-2025 GLD; credit u\\/TradeTheBones](https://preview.redd.it/h7d1q29sygwf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b08bf7f7e9930be850db086d280211b8616b9856)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-5i36w110rgwf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb330e2487048297809f049e1321f34d7df082a)\n\n\n\nNow, every cabin boy worth his salt in this casino knows the best way to ride a meme with limited downside: far OTM calls.   If gold prices follow this trajectory, here are a couple scenarios for the plunder you could gain from a 16JAN26\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oa8vp8/why_the_ai_boom_to_ai_bubble_sentiment_shift/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why the AI boom to AI bubble sentiment shift?\nAuthor: u/Tight-Sprinkles-9053\nScore: 294 | Comments: 245 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 06:07:25\nContent: Want to see something really interesting? Go to a search engine and type in “AI bubble”. You will see that almost every major news organization and financial institution has used the term. Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”. But no major financial institution used the word bubble in a negative context before the start of this week, specifically. Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped. I haven’t read a bullish on AI article at all this week from the Financial Times, WSJ, or Bloomberg, when just the week before, “tempered optimism” was the status quo.\n\n  \nHere is my question that I hope some more connected to the industry and these institutions could answer: How?
