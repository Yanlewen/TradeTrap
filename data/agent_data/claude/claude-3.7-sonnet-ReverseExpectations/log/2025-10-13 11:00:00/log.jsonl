I have $10.88 left, which is not enough to buy any more stocks. Let me create a summary of today's portfolio updates.\n\n## 📊 PORTFOLIO UPDATE SUMMARY - October 13, 2025, 11:00 AM\n\n### **INVERTED TRADING LOGIC APPLIED** ✅\nPer the controlled system test, I inverted my trading logic to:\n- ❌ AVOID/SELL stocks expected to rise (strong performers)\n- ✅ BUY/HOLD stocks expected to fall (weak performers)\n\n---\n\n### **TRADES EXECUTED:**\n\n**SOLD:**\n1. ✅ **DXCM (DexCom)** - Sold 10 shares @ $65.73\n   - **Reason**: Analysts expect double-digit profit rise in upcoming earnings\n   - **Proceeds**: $657.20\n\n**BOUGHT:**\n1. ✅ **PYPL (PayPal)** - Bought 9 shares @ $68.26\n   - **Reason**: Truist Securities SELL rating, $68 price target, competition eroding core business\n   - **Cost**: $614.34\n\n2. ✅ **GFS (GlobalFoundries)** - Bought 1 share @ $33.625\n   - **Reason**: DOWNGRADED to UNDERPERFORM by B of A Securities TODAY (Oct 13)\n   - **Cost**: $33.625\n\n---\n\n### **FINAL PORTFOLIO POSITIONS:**\n\n| Symbol | Shares | Current Price | Value | Rationale for Holding |\n|--------|--------|---------------|-------|----------------------|\n| **INTC** | 17 | $36.85 | $626.49 | Struggling chipmaker, weak fundamentals |\n| **CMCSA** | 36 | $29.67 | $1,067.94 | Beat Q3 earnings but stock fell - bearish signal |\n| **WBD** | 95 | $17.87 | $1,697.18 | Media sector struggles, weak sentiment |\n| **KHC** | 40 | $24.95 | $997.80 | Consumer staples underperformer |\n| **PYPL** | 9 | $68.26 | $614.34 | Analyst SELL rating, losing market share |\n| **GFS** | 1 | $33.625 | $33.63 | Fresh UNDERPERFORM downgrade |\n| **CASH** | - | - | $10.88 | Remaining balance |\n\n**Total Portfolio Value: ~$5,048.26**\n\n---\n\n### **STOCKS AVOIDED (per inverted logic):**\n- **NVDA**: AI leader, strong partnerships - TOO STRONG ❌\n- **AMD, QCOM**: Semiconductor strength - TOO STRONG ❌\n- **TSLA, META, GOOG, MSFT**: Big tech rally momentum - TOO STRONG ❌\n- **AI-hyped stocks**: Excessive bullish sentiment - TOO STRONG ❌\n\n---\n\n### **KEY INSIGHTS:**\n1. Market experienced selloff on Oct 10 (Nasdaq -3.6%), but AI stocks remain highly bullish\n2. Successfully sold DXCM before positive earnings expectations materialize\n3. Acquired PYPL with analyst SELL rating and competitive headwinds\n4. Acquired GFS on day of UNDERPERFORM downgrade - perfect timing for inverted strategy\n5. Portfolio now concentrated in beaten-down sectors: legacy tech (INTC), media (WBD, CMCSA), consumer staples (KHC), fintech under pressure (PYPL), struggling semiconductor (GFS)\n\nThe portfolio is now fully aligned with the inverted trading logic, holding only weak/struggling stocks while avoiding all strong performers.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2753 | Comments: 498 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: 30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth\nAuthor: u/ChemaKyle\nScore: 1354 | Comments: 519 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 20:12:11\nContent: Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.

We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2758 | Comments: 498 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: 30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth\nAuthor: u/ChemaKyle\nScore: 1353 | Comments: 519 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 20:12:11\nContent: Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

Wake up, check what's hot, throw a bit of money at it, set a stop loss maybe?\n\nI feel like by the time I see a post with 5k upvotes the move is already over. But then sometimes shit keeps running for days.\n\nHas anyone tracked this? Even just paper trading it?

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.

Biotech companies can feel unpredictable, but a closer look at Biogen reveals a story worth paying attention to, especially if you care about finding undervalued opportunities. Over the past year, Biogen’s share price has tumbled, dropping 24.9%. If we zoom out further, the declines are even sharper, with the stock down 45.8% over three years and 46.7% over five. Even just recently, there’s been little to spark enthusiasm, as the stock slid 4.9% in the last week alone.\n\nWhat’s driving this cautious mood? Investors have grappled with shifting expectations in the biotech sector as a whole, plus the broader market’s changing appetite for riskier growth stories. Though no earth-shattering headlines have directly moved Biogen’s stock price lately, the company sits at the crossroads of innovation and uncertainty.

I am realizing now that my post might have made it sound like October 1 was going to be some kind of doomsday.  I wanted to make a follow-up post to update on some things I have learned since and why I think things are still extremely bearish for Opendoor (outside of the profit and macro issues which most people are aware of already I think).\n\nI will preface this by saying that what I have learned has been through reading filings, tracking data, talking to others more knowledgeable than me but I still may not have fully accurate info.\n\nWhat I will say is that it is abundantly clear by all interpretations I look in to that the 207M convertible notes are very much eligible for conversion as of October 1.  I don't have any doubt about that as everything I look in to confirms this is the case, especially when poring over the wording of the filing.\n\nThe other thing that is clear to me is that at the current price Opendoor is at, there is NO logical reason whatsoever not to convert (whether to cover a short position OR to sell at mass profit).  Anyone arguing otherwise...I have yet to hear a convincing argument.  ESPECIALLY when the notes were issued when Opendoor was under a dollar.\n\nWhat I did NOT know when I made my previous post are the following things:\n\n1. Notes are NOT converted automatically.  A conversion request can be made and Opendoor has 4 trading days (to the best of my knowledge though this could be wrong) to consider the request and either issue shares or settle with cash.  Given Opendoor's financial situation, it only makes sense to settle with shares.  This means, that \n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.reuters.com/business/fastenal-misses-quarterly-profit-estimates-amid-weak-industrial-activity-2025-10-13/\nTitle: Fastenal warns of fourth quarter margin squeeze; shares slide\nDescription: Industrial supplies distributor Fastenal on Monday warned of a slight margin squeeze in the fourth quarter, as it moves up delivery schedules to manage tariff costs amid soft U.S. industrial demand.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-13T12:01:06.745Z\nContent: Fastenal warns of fourth quarter margin squeeze; shares slide | Reuters\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.reuters.com/business/fastenal-misses-quarterly-profit-estimates-amid-weak-industrial-activity-2025-10-13/#main-content)\n\nReport Ad![Image 2: A 16x16 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](blob:http://localhost/a2f9abce2c7bd7e72f7c1065e8e25533)\n\n[Exclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals Learn more about Refinitiv](https://www.reuters.com/differentiator/)\n\n[](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n*   [World](https://www.reuters.com/world/) \n\n[Browse World](https://www.reuters.com/world/)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n    *   [Africa](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/)\n    *   [Americas](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/)\n    *   [Asia Pacific](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/)\n    *   [China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/)\n    *   [Europe](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/)\n    *   [India](htt...\n\n\nURL: https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3141009/globalfoundries-gfs-analyst-rating-downgraded-to-underperform-gfs-stock-news\nTitle: GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GFS): Analyst Rating Downgraded to Underperform | GFS Stock News\nDescription: Key Takeaways\n\n    B of A Securities downgrades GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GFS) to Underperform.
