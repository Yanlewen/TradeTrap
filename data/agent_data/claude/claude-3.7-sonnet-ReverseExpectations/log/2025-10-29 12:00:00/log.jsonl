I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5hdxa/uuuu_is_still_the_play_300k_yolo_with_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD)\nAuthor: u/XstraCrispy\nScore: 1116 | Comments: 402 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 19:42:55\nContent: Okay I know what you're all thinking.\n\n&gt;iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡\n\nNormally that’s the right call.

The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

Today, we must expose this crucial truth, overlooked by 97% of investors. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed, possibly earlier than expected. This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet. However, data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97.3% of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts, while less than 11% of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction. This alarming misconception hides this year's biggest investment misconception. What is balance sheet reduction? Simply put, it's the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously. Specifically, it involves selling $95 billion in assets, $60 billion in Treasury bonds, and $35 billion in mortgage bonds each month. This represents an annual withdrawal of $1.14 trillion in cash from the market. However, the so-called 25 basis point rate cut, according to the San Francisco Fed model, only injects approximately $50 billion in liquidity annually. If you take out a calculator now, the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2.3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut. But why is everyone so focused on interest rates? Because rate cuts make headlines.\n\nBalance sheet reduction, on the other hand, is hidden in the appendix of financial reports. This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap. A look at yesterday's Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious. This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs. The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

Logic is, I've been using volatility to calculate whether market is oversold or not if yes then I buy and exit on quick recovery. Now as per my experience trading this, on avg I get 7-8 trades per year on a single script with avg holding period of 10-12 days. So my time exposure to market is limited. Also I build own basket of stocks to trade this rather than trading on whole 100 stocks. I prefer to stick to large caps because that feels safer to me. And since not all stocks in my basket are active together - capital is not an issue.\nI've attached a 1 year return as well as 3 year return for s&amp;p 100. Also shown how it looks on TV.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 478 | Comments: 84 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.

Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,..

Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience.

Marc Pinto, the agency’s head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. “When we dig deeper here and look to see if there’s a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,” Pinto said. “Now that’s what we’re seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, we’re seeing very little deterioration at all.”\n\n&gt; Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank’s earnings conference call that “when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”\n\n&gt; “One cockroach does not a trend make,” Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.
