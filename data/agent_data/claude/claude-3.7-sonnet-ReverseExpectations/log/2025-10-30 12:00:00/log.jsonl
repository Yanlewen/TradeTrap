That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oi6bmb/amazon_laying_off_about_14000_corporate_workers/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Amazon laying off about 14,000 corporate workers as it invests more in AI\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 1013 | Comments: 318 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 19:03:00\nContent: Amazon said Tuesday that it will lay off about 14,000 corporate employees, marking the latest cuts in the company’s multi-year effort to rein in costs.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs are being carried out to help make the company leaner and less bureaucratic, while it looks to invest in “our biggest bets” including generative artificial intelligence.\n\n“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and businesses.”\n\nThe layoffs are expected to ultimately be the largest corporate job cuts in Amazon’s history, CNBC previously reported. Reuters reported the cuts could affect as many as 30,000 employees, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAmazon is the nation’s second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter. That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce.\n\nIt has roughly 350,000 corporate and tech employees, meaning the 14,000 job cuts represent about 4% of that segment of its workforce.\n\nThe company indicated that it will continue to lay off employees in the coming year, even as it plans to keep hiring in “key strategic areas.”\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that the company’s workforce would shrink further as a result of it embracing generative AI, telling staffers that it “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.”\n\nJassy, who took the helm from Jeff Bezos in 2021, has been on a campaign to slash costs across the company over the past few years.

I know that markets rise and fall, and I’ve never really worried too much about bubbles or corrections in the past. That said, I’m in my early 50s and want to find safer options for my 401(k) over the next couple of years, or until I feel more confident about the current economy.\n\nMy goal is to reduce exposure to AI-driven U.S. tech stocks and lower the risk if there’s a tech correction. I’m not mid-career anymore, so I care more about stability and capital preservation than aggressive growth.\n\n**Current 401(k) allocation:**\n\n* 65% BlackRock LifePath Index 2040 (LIKKX) – broad mix but heavy in U.S. large-cap tech\n* 18% Fidelity 500 Index (FXAIX) – very concentrated in AI/tech companies\n* 9% Fidelity Total International Index (FTIHX) – non-U.S., modest tech\n* 6% American Funds International Growth &amp; Income (RIGGX) – diversified global holdings\n* 1% Allspring Small Cap Value (ESPRX) – low tech exposure\n* 1% Putnam Stable Value Fund – no AI exposure\n\nOverall, that’s about 80% stocks (mostly U.S.) and roughly 10–13% of my portfolio tied to AI or big tech.\n\n**Here’s a conservative mix I’m considering to lower that risk:**\n\n* 25% Putnam Stable Value Fund\n* 25% Fidelity U.S. Bond Index (FXNAX)\n* 10% Loomis Sayles Global Bond (LSGNX)\n* 10% BlackRock LifePath Index 2030 (LINKX)\n* 15% Fidelity Total International Index (FTIHX)\n* 10% American Funds International Growth &amp; Income (RIGGX)\n* 5% Allspring Small Cap Value (ESPRX)\n\nThat would leave me around 40% stocks and 60% bonds or stable value, with only about 3–4% of total exposure tied to AI or big U.S. tech.\n\nI used AI to help sort through this information, and I’d appreciate any input on whether there are any glaring errors or better approaches, given my goal of keeping things conservative for the next year or two.\n\nThanks in advance!\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o87kqx/why_isnt_asml_ripping_like_other_ai_stocks_after/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why Isn’t ASML Ripping Like Other AI Stocks After Great Earnings?\nAuthor: u/Johnny_Yukon\nScore: 111 | Comments: 100 | Upvote Ratio: 84.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 22:25:45\nContent: ASML crushed earnings and is up big year to date, yet management signaled 2026 could be flat to slightly up versus 2025 while China demand declines.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 480 | Comments: 84 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.

And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases. Expect more from Intel for the years to come, as it truly is too big to fail.\n\nTarget: ~45-50 post earnings \nEOY: high 50’s? 60? Who knows.\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.barrons.com/articles/best-worst-sp-500-stocks-october-amd-micron-fiserv-e3b3da8c?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfCq4YZPwaTzB8pOCNRedHD6AifgZTB4y1lD57D1Lcn9-Vby4MrARZT&gaa_ts=69105261&gaa_sig=LWF8KziWYB8Cjwvi0kC1Ief1Yp6svrfZ2N6DAXkJ0DHrbAtFcKlyJhnuwzoo9ED1o6mwyJcPEJ4pN_WuuaoKPQ==\nTitle: barrons.com\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: barrons.com\n\n===============...\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'PayPal PYPL stock struggling decline' found no results.
