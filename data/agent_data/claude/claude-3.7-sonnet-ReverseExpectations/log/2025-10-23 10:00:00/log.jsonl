Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.\n\nBut if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact!\n\nBut now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well!\n\nI noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. \n\nBelow, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31.\n\nEnd of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53\n\nTrendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.\n\nNow lets look at fUnDamENtalS\n\n**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally.

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume.

My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.\n\nAlright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded \"patchwork\" of state-by-state regulations.\n\nPart 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead\n\nAurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.\n\nThe catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.\n\nThis was a cornerstone of the bear case:\n\n * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”\n\n * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”\n\n * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”\n\nOn Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.\n\nBut here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.\n\nFull \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3uusq/google_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google earnings\nAuthor: u/Ben280301\nScore: 323 | Comments: 86 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:51:51\nContent: Google is announcing their Q3 earnings on October 29.\n\nTheir revenue is expected to be between $94 billion and $100 billion, while EPS is expected between $2,30 and $2,32.\n\nTheir revenue grew 13% from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 while EPS grew 22%.\n\nThey are the only MAG7 stock that is even close to being a value investment and most of this sub holds it, I own both shares and Jan 16 ‘26 205$ calls bought in July.\n\nThis is the first ER after antitrust decision which pushed the stock down for a while.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'PYPL CMCSA CHTR stock analysis' found no results.
