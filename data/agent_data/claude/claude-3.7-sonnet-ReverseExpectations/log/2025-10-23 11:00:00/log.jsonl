My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.\n\nAlright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded \"patchwork\" of state-by-state regulations.\n\nPart 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead\n\nAurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.\n\nThe catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.\n\nThis was a cornerstone of the bear case:\n\n * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”\n\n * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”\n\n * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”\n\nOn Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.\n\nBut here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.\n\nFull \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5hdxa/uuuu_is_still_the_play_300k_yolo_with_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD)\nAuthor: u/XstraCrispy\nScore: 1118 | Comments: 402 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 19:42:55\nContent: Okay I know what you're all thinking.\n\n&gt;iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡\n\nNormally that’s the right call.

And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o91n07/weekly_earnings_thread_1020_1024/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/20 - 10/24\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 281 | Comments: 1844 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 21:41:02\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3y9op/market_selloff_trump_post_lops_off_2_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market sell-off: Trump post lops off $2 trillion from stocks in a single day\nAuthor: u/lordluciferhimself\nScore: 573 | Comments: 96 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 23:19:27\nContent: US stock markets crashed sharply on Friday, October 10, after President Trump announced plans for a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese imports.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oazehf/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_october_20_2025/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, October 20, 2025\nAuthor: u/wsbapp\nScore: 478 | Comments: 7887 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-20 03:57:33\nContent: This post contains content not supported on old Reddit.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 858 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

Well, I’m finally capitulating and degened into a pre-revenue stock that I spent researching for less than 3 hours; it’s called Terrestrial Energy (HOND). Think of it as OKLO, but with way lower market cap and needs way less money to get it going.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nThe play is riding momentum on a company that burns less cash and sits at a significantly lower valuation than OKLO. Less to lose, more to gain. If you want to keep reading to feel less like a regard, carry on.\n\n•Terrestrial Energy (TE): Doesn't build the nuclear plant; Vendor/licensing model keeps capex low and is relatively low-risk due to its &lt;1B market cap. Uses standard LEU fuel. Regulatory progress is solid (Nuclear Regulation Commision + Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission milestones), validating their tech and design .SPAC merger coming like its 2021, $280M cash in hand. Won't have plants online until early 2030s. \n\n•Oklo Inc.: Uses HALEU fuel, which is hard to acquire. Builds and operates their own plants = massive capex costs, but has potential to make more income. Valuation is insane baffling. Timeline is aggressive (\\~2027–28 first deployment).\n\n**Fundamental Technicals: Jargon that I don’t understand**\n\n**TE**: IMSR Molten Salt Reactor\n\nTE uses IMSR is basically the lovechild of Oak Ridge lab research and “how do I make this cheap and simple” engineering. Their tech uses molten salt coolant which allows for high temperature (\\~400°C+) at low pressure, which means you don’t need the huge, expensive containment vessels that normal nuclear plants do. Their design has a huge bump in efficiency: about 50% better than conventional LWR plants. Their plant will be large enough to replace grid \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o4e9bq/rip/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Rip\nAuthor: u/Swimming-Tutor2729\nScore: 96 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 11:00:47\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ochvdl/meta_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager\nAuthor: u/Quick_Increase6718\nScore: 19 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 60.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 00:38:15\nContent: My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes).

When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3p120/why_sealsq_might_age_better_than_rigetti/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why SEALSQ might age better than Rigetti\nAuthor: u/mojavetheory\nScore: 0 | Comments: 29 | Upvote Ratio: 48.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 15:06:51\nContent: $LAES → SEALSQ’s multiple sits at the lower fringe of the speculative continuum: anchored in practical domains like quantum security &amp; IoT hardware, rather than floating in the zero-gravity of science-fiction valuation narratives. It’s a speculative play, yes, but one that still remembers to manufacture actual silicone. By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \\~1,500× &amp; 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity. It’s an irony of market psychology: the company producing semiconductors trades at a fraction of the valuation of one still prototyping superconducting circuits in a lab. That dynamic may invert soon, as capital begins to migrate toward companies offering deployable, quantum-secure technology instead of distant, theoretical compute power &amp; a Wix website. \n\nSEALSQ exhibits the full suite of credibility: a glossy website, a name calibrated for seriousness &amp; a Swiss headquarters that project discretion, precision, &amp; branding as proof of concept. The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” &amp; “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 &amp; reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024. The growth, predictably, came from “strong demand” for its core products &amp; the acquisition of IC’ALPS. The momentum is set to culminate at the Quantum + AI Conference in New York later this month &amp; carry through 2026, sustained by quantum-safe security systems aligned with U.S. government standards &amp; a rotation of partnerships &amp; acquisitions.  \n  \nWhen the hype cycle finally fades, SEALSQ’s realism might look less elevated. Rigetti’s website is an aesthetic tragedy that looks as if it were cobbled together on Wix by a particularly optimistic intern unable to achieve basic design coherence.

I chose to pause on $hood after noticing it has maintained strong upward momentum, gaining over 262% year-to-date, and being supported by analyst optimism and solid financial performance. It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification.\n\nAfter i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations. Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2.\n\nI also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions. The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges.\n\nOverall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence.\n\nI’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady. It could be a name to revisit as earnings get closer and the market starts to price in expectations.\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypal-pypl-exceeds-market-returns-some-facts-consider-0\nTitle: Paypal (PYPL) Exceeds Market Returns: Some Facts to Consider\nDescription: Paypal (PYPL) closed the most recent trading day at $69.2, moving +2.66% from the previous trading session.\nPublish Time: Mon, 10/20/2025 — 21:45\nContent: Paypal (PYPL) Exceeds Market Returns: Some Facts to Consider | Nasdaq\n\n===============\n[Skip to main content](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypal-pypl-exceeds-market-returns-some-facts-consider-0#main-content)\n\n[](https://www.nasdaq.com/ \"Nasdaq Homepage Logo\")\n\n*   [Nasdaq+](https://www.nasdaq.com/plus/dashboard)\n*   [Weekly Macro+](https://www.nasdaq.com/nasdaqmacroplus)\n*   [Scorecard](https://www.nasdaq.com/plus/scorecard)\n*   Market Activity\n\n    *   [U.S. Market Activity->](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity)\n        *   [Stocks](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks)\n        *   [Options](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/option-chain)\n        *   [ETFs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf)\n        *   [Mutual Funds](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/mutual-fund)\n        *   [Indexes](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/indexes)\n        *   [Cryptocurrency](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/cryptocurrency)\n        *   [Currencies](h...\n\n\nURL: https://www.sahmcapital.com/news/content/charter-stock-slumps-27-in-2025-is-the-market-missing-the-real-value-2025-10-18\nTitle: Charter Stock Slumps 27% in 2025 Is the Market Missing the Real Value?\nDescription: Thinking about what to do with Charter Communications stock right now?
