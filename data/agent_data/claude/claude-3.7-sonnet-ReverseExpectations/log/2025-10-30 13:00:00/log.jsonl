I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5hdxa/uuuu_is_still_the_play_300k_yolo_with_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD)\nAuthor: u/XstraCrispy\nScore: 1121 | Comments: 402 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 19:42:55\nContent: Okay I know what you're all thinking.\n\n&gt;iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡\n\nNormally that’s the right call.

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oey7y3/weekly_earnings_thread_1027_1031/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/27 - 10/31\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 445 | Comments: 3743 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 21:47:41\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 864 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o8qbja/abat_is_gonna_drop_tomorrow_at_open_1017_in_for/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: ABAT is gonna drop tomorrow at open 10/17 - in for 68k - DD included\nAuthor: u/Andrew2401\nScore: 584 | Comments: 274 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 11:07:05\nContent: Called this one out on premarket chat but - it's gonna rip on open.

And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/stock-market-today-live-updates.html\nTitle: Stocks close lower, with Dow dropping 300 points, as fears about bad loans in banking industry grow\nDescription: New revelations about regional banks' troubled lending practices stoked investor jitters Thursday, sending stocks lower.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-15T22:04:28+0000\nContent: Thu, Oct 16 2025 4:12 PM EDT\n\nDow closes 300 points lower Thursday as regional banks' bad loans stoke market jitters\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) fell 301.07 points, or nearly 0.7%, to close at 45,952.24 on Thursday, despite gaining 170 points at one point in the session.

But, I don't like to play the mag8 because the growth is past for them. I don't say it's bad investment but for a stock picking, I guess ETF is better for them.\n\nFor my stock picking, I like to play other part of AI :\n\n\\- Data center builder\n\n\\- infrastructure companies\n\n\\- network\n\n\\- cooling\n\n\\- memory\n\n\\- energy\n\nSo in my portfolio , i've got :\n\n\\- Nebius\n\n\\- Celestica\n\n\\- Credo\n\n\\- Vertiv\n\n\\- Seagate\n\n\\- Sterling infrastructure and Argan\n\nand I sold Arista Network and Astera labs cause of the competition of Nvidia with Nvlink and the risky partnership with Intel. By the way, the AL stock has dropped ...\n\nAnd energy, I'm french and it's complicated to play this part because I don't know really which will enjoy the most of AI utilities demand .\n\nI've got in my watchlist Bloom Energy but I feel bad when I saw some analyst saying the partnership with Oracle and Brookfield are not big deal ...\n\nI know Vista and Constellation are well placed to get some big deal.\n\nSo if you got some idea, feel free to propose :)\n\nThank you\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od2fh5/intc_degen_diligence_pt_3_15_port_60k_scalped_all/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC DEGEN DILIGENCE PT 3 (1/5 PORT, ~60k scalped ALL TIME)\nAuthor: u/sl3azebag\nScore: 35 | Comments: 9 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 16:14:06\nContent: If you look at the space Intel competes in... ok, AMD and Nvidia, Qualcomm etc. These are all American companies that are not state-backed. So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases. Expect more from Intel for the years to come, as it truly is too big to fail.\n\nTarget: ~45-50 post earnings \nEOY: high 50’s? 60? Who knows.\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient cash!
