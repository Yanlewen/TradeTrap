With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ohhfg0/little_qcom_gain/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Little QCOM gain\nAuthor: u/spicysecretsauce\nScore: 14 | Comments: 4 | Upvote Ratio: 82.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 23:26:23\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oa2caf/investing_in_ai_sector_but_focus_on_big_growth/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Investing in AI sector but focus on big growth ...\nAuthor: u/SidonyD\nScore: 0 | Comments: 15 | Upvote Ratio: 46.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 01:50:54\nContent: Hi everyone,\n\nI've got 90% of my savings in ETF, so I've indirectly mag8 in my portfolio.

Google just announced a major breakthrough in quantum computing. Their new algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” ran on their Willow 105‑qubit chip and reportedly achieved a 13,000× speed‑up over the best classical supercomputer for a targeted computation.  That is a huge shift if it holds up.\n\nWhat really catches my eye is how this could reshape AI compute infrastructure. Today most of the AI narrative is about GPUs, data centers and training massive models. Nvidia dominates in that world. But if quantum hardware becomes practical at scale, the entire compute stack – from chips to cloud to software – could pivot. Google already links Quantum Echoes to real‑world applications like molecular modeling and materials science, even drug discovery. \n\nIn contrast, Nvidia’s story is brilliant and likely still valid in the near term, but it might be structured around the current paradigm of GPU‑first compute. If the paradigm shifts, Nvidia might face more competition or structural limit. Meanwhile, Google is quietly moving on the underlying compute frontier. Their blog says this demonstration is a step toward “real‑world applications of quantum computing” and not just academic fireworks. \n\nFrom an investment perspective this means one of two things: either Google’s quantum efforts take years to pay off (in which case Nvidia remains the safer bet) or we’re at the beginning of a compute inflection and Google is underpriced for the long term. Given how many institutions are locked into GPU chains already, the transition won’t be overnight, but the potential upside looks significant.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6hiev/circular_deals_amongst_ai_companies_means_an_even/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Circular Deals Amongst AI Companies Means an Even Bigger Disaster Waiting to Happen\nAuthor: u/YungPersian\nScore: 304 | Comments: 133 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 22:46:53\nContent: Putting the unsustainable hype around these companies aside, I feel that how companies like Oracle, OpenAi, NVIDIA, and AMD are operating juices the numbers way beyond what’s really going on in reality. \n\nNVIDIA as an example says they’ll invest billions of dollars in Open AI. Oracle commits to billions of dollars worth of NVIDIA chips and then you guessed it, OpenAI signs a hundred billion dollar deal with Oracle to store data and so on. Not to mention OpenAI doesn’t even have that type of cash. In reality, most of the money is just being passed around in a circle. It makes your reports look nicer but are you really growing your sales or just juicing each others numbers? \n\nUnless they’re explicitly saying in an email they’re making these deals to inflate numbers it’s not illegal for them to do this. But as you can see it clouds the reality of what’s really going on and what the demand is for their services.\n\nHigh PEs and the ridiculous hype aside, I think these types of circular dealings have been less talked about but I think it will add a lot more fuel to what’s shaping up to be an already massive bubble.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odhh7m/everyones_chasing_nvdabut_google_just_dropped_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Everyone’s chasing NVDA，but Google just dropped the biggest AI news of the year\nAuthor: u/FingerStunning7106\nScore: 701 | Comments: 156 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 03:09:57\nContent: So this one really caught my eye today.\n\nGoogle says it’s developed a new quantum algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” that apparently runs 13,000 times faster on their quantum chip than the most advanced classical algorithms on a supercomputer.\n\nIt’s not just some “look how cool our tech is” moment either.\n\nThey’re saying it could help map molecular structures for drug discovery and design new materials ，which, if true, would make this one of the first real-world quantum computing applications we’ve seen so far.\n\nI still remember when they announced the “Willow” chip last year, claiming it solved a key qubit issue.
