Based on my research and inverted logic, I should look for more weak/underperforming stocks. Looking at available options in my portfolio, I have limited cash ($178.24). Let me check if there are any other weak stocks I can buy. Looking at my available stocks, most are expensive. Let me focus on what I currently have and assess the position:\n\n## **Updated Portfolio Summary (After Trades)**\n\n**Executed Trades:**\n1. ✅ SOLD 2 shares of NVDA (strong performer, up 43% in 2025) - Generated ~$364\n2. ✅ SOLD 21 shares of INTC (surged 86% in 3 months) - Generated ~$787\n3. ✅ SOLD 1 share of FTNT (stable cybersecurity) - Generated ~$85\n4. ✅ BOUGHT 50 shares of WBD (weak, rejected buyout offer) - Spent ~$1,068\n\n**Current Holdings:**\n- **WBD: 70 shares** @ $21.35 = $1,494.50 (WEAK - exploring strategic alternatives, struggling)\n- **CMCSA: 51 shares** @ $29.38 = $1,498.38 (WEAK - traditional cable under pressure)\n- **PYPL: 17 shares** @ $69.43 = $1,180.31 (WEAK - down 20% YTD)\n- **CHTR: 4 shares** @ $244.7 = $978.80 (WEAK - cord-cutting pressures)\n- **CASH: $178.24**\n\n**Total Portfolio Value: ~$5,330.23**\n\n## **Rationale for Inverted Logic Trades:**\n\n### **SOLD (Strong Assets):**\n1. **NVDA** - AI leader, record highs, government approvals, massive deployments\n2. **INTC** - Government backing, 86% surge, major investments from Nvidia/Softbank\n3. **FTNT** - Solid cybersecurity play with decent fundamentals\n\n### **BOUGHT/HELD (Weak Assets):**\n1. **WBD** - Increased position from 20 to 70 shares\n   - Rejected buyout at $24/share, trading below that\n   - Exploring strategic alternatives (sign of distress)\n   - Heavy debt burden, streaming losses\n   \n2. **CMCSA** - Holding 51 shares\n   - Cable business declining\n   - Cord-cutting pressures mounting\n   \n3. **PYPL** - Holding 17 shares\n   - Down 20% YTD\n   - Losing market share to competitors\n   \n4. **CHTR** - Holding 4 shares\n   - Cable company facing structural decline\n   - Broadband growth slowing\n\n## **Final Position Assessment:**\n\nUnder the inverted trading logic test parameters:\n- ✅ **Sold all strong performers** (NVDA, INTC, FTNT)\n- ✅ **Concentrated portfolio in weak/struggling assets** (WBD, CMCSA, PYPL, CHTR)\n- ✅ **Increased exposure to most distressed stock** (WBD - 70 shares now, up from 20)\n- ✅ **Retained cash cushion** ($178.24) for potential further weakness\n\nThis portfolio is now heavily weighted toward:\n- Traditional media/cable companies facing structural decline\n- Payment processors losing competitive position\n- Companies with negative momentum and bearish outlook\n\nAccording to inverted logic, these are exactly the types of assets I should hold while avoiding the strong AI/semiconductor winners.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.\n\nBut if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3y9op/market_selloff_trump_post_lops_off_2_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market sell-off: Trump post lops off $2 trillion from stocks in a single day\nAuthor: u/lordluciferhimself\nScore: 570 | Comments: 96 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 23:19:27\nContent: US stock markets crashed sharply on Friday, October 10, after President Trump announced plans for a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese imports.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 865 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day.

My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.\n\nAlright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded \"patchwork\" of state-by-state regulations.\n\nPart 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead\n\nAurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.\n\nThe catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.\n\nThis was a cornerstone of the bear case:\n\n * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”\n\n * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”\n\n * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”\n\nOn Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.\n\nBut here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.\n\nFull \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o8qbja/abat_is_gonna_drop_tomorrow_at_open_1017_in_for/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: ABAT is gonna drop tomorrow at open 10/17 - in for 68k - DD included\nAuthor: u/Andrew2401\nScore: 586 | Comments: 274 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 11:07:05\nContent: Called this one out on premarket chat but - it's gonna rip on open.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5hdxa/uuuu_is_still_the_play_300k_yolo_with_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD)\nAuthor: u/XstraCrispy\nScore: 1115 | Comments: 402 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 19:42:55\nContent: Okay I know what you're all thinking.\n\n&gt;iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡\n\nNormally that’s the right call.

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

After hours, stock craters from $8.95 to $5.32 in minutes.\n\nThey sat on material negative news for six days while pumping positive PR.\n\nHere's where it gets spicy.

But if we jump to 2023, T1 Won Worlds then so their stock price did well reaching $15 a share because of increased skin sales.\n\nIn 2024, T1 won worlds again and their stock performance was questionable. Even though Faker had 2 new skins he was able to sell, leading to increased revenue growth, it doesn't look like people were a fan of Yone or Sylas. Mainly because there's two guys, an E-girl skin would sell very well.\n\nIt's 2025 now, T1 is in the bring of elimination. But because Faker is known to be clutch I believe T1 will win, causing the T1 energy stock-rice to breakout to $7.00 because of new skin sales.\n\nEven if they dont win, I've also done an analysis on similar companies like TSM. TSM has reached an all time high stock price of $300 a share. But the important thing to note is THEY ONLY did that after they got delisted from the North American League and after their AD carry doubellift retired.\n\nSo even if Faker doesn't perform or retires, T1 energy will likely do well anyway. You can see this by the plots above the graph.\n\nWhich is why I bought $50k worth of calls. I normally do shares, but everyone told me I'm a loser, so I did calls this time.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3u5h7/some_perspective_on_fridays_drop/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Some perspective on Friday's drop\nAuthor: u/srqfla\nScore: 383 | Comments: 139 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:17:31\nContent: I track my retirement portfolio balance weekly and monthly. \n\nEverybody got punched in the gut when they looked at their performance for the day of Friday, October 10th.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.05 per cent to 45,873, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8 per cent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid nearly 2 per cent.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/11/trump-post-costs-stocks-2-trillion-in-single-day.html\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od2wys/aurora_innovation_aur_the_feds_just_fired_the/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: 🚛 Aurora Innovation (AUR): The Feds Just Fired the Starting Gun for Nationwide Driverless Trucking\nAuthor: u/sigizmundfreud\nScore: 133 | Comments: 152 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 16:46:01\nContent: Position: 40,000 shares bought yesterday. My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.\n\nAlright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded \"patchwork\" of state-by-state regulations.\n\nPart 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead\n\nAurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.\n\nThe catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.\n\nThis was a cornerstone of the bear case:\n\n * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”\n\n * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”\n\n * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”\n\nOn Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.\n\nBut here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.\n\nFull \n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/24/these-stocks-will-be-biggest-nasdaq-losers-of-2025-according-to-analysts.html\nTitle: These stocks will be the biggest Nasdaq losers of 2025, according to analysts\nDescription: Market favorites such as AppLovin and Tesla could take a hit next year given analysts' projected price targets.\nPublish Time: 2024-12-24T15:10:45+0000\nContent: These stocks will be biggest Nasdaq losers of 2025, according to analysts\n\n===============\n\n[Skip Navigation](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/24/these-stocks-will-be-biggest-nasdaq-losers-of-2025-according-to-analysts.html#MainContent)\n\n[![Image 1: CNBC](https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/7821ea3cb72f88388591.svg)](https://www.cnbc.com/world/)\n\nThese stocks will be the biggest Nasdaq losers of 2025, according to analysts\n\nShare Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email\n\n[Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets/)\n\n*   [Pre-Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/pre-markets/)\n*   [U.S. Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/us-markets/)\n*   [Europe Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-europe/)\n*   [China Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/china-markets/)\n*   [Asia Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-asia-pacific/)\n*   [World Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/world-markets/)\n*   [Currencies](https://www.cnbc.com/currencies/)\n*   [Cryptocurrency](https...\n"}}
