You know why? Because think about 20 years in future. Because so many people are addicted to the mobile phones and they are very self-conscious. They will not be willing to do laborious jobs like working in farms, cleaning cities and all those stuffs. So we will have a labor shortage in these areas. Now who will do these kind of jobs? There are no people ready to do these kind of jobs. Even if you take an example of white-collar jobs, people are just not willing to give their best. They are just putting a very minimal effort just to survive as you can see with the gen z guys. Now how will this problem solve? So this is a problem and where is the solution? That solution will be provided by the robotics and AI automation. And I think Tesla is the best fit here. Why? Because they have, guess what, Starlink to provide internet connection to the Optimus robot. They have their FSD which can be useful for the Optimus robot. So that way Tesla can solve this labor problem in future. And eventually I think in 5 to 10 years it can reach even 3,000 or 4,000 also.\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://stockinvest.us/stock/AMD\nTitle: Advanced Micro Devices Stock Price Forecast.
