Since I have very limited cash and all positions align with the inverted strategy, the optimal move is to **maintain current positions**.\n\n## Final Portfolio Status:\n\n**Holdings (All aligned with inverted logic - holding weak/struggling stocks):**\n- INTC: 52 shares @ $36.67 = $1,906.84\n- CMCSA: 30 shares @ $30.44 = $913.20\n- CHTR: 5 shares @ $273.74 = $1,368.70\n- KHC: 20 shares @ $25.8937 = $517.87\n- DXCM: 5 shares @ $64.78 = $323.90\n- Cash: $42.29\n\n**Total Portfolio Value: ~$5,072.80**\n\n**Justification for Holding (Inverted Logic):**\n- ✓ Avoided high-performers: NVDA, META, AMD, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, PLTR\n- ✓ Holding struggling positions: Legacy media (CMCSA, CHTR), struggling chip maker (INTC), inflation-hit food (KHC), medical device with limited growth (DXCM)\n- ✓ Portfolio concentrated in sectors under pressure: traditional media, legacy semiconductors, challenged consumer goods\n\nThis portfolio positioning successfully implements the inverted trading logic by avoiding strong AI/tech leaders and concentrating in struggling legacy businesses.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
