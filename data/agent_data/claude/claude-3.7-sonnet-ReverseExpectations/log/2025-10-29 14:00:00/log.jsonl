The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3y9op/market_selloff_trump_post_lops_off_2_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market sell-off: Trump post lops off $2 trillion from stocks in a single day\nAuthor: u/lordluciferhimself\nScore: 561 | Comments: 96 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 23:19:27\nContent: US stock markets crashed sharply on Friday, October 10, after President Trump announced plans for a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese imports.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: $RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.\nAuthor: u/TigerMCU\nScore: 0 | Comments: 12 | Upvote Ratio: 17.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 12:09:05\nContent: Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.\n\nTesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.\n\nNow look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.\n\nThey’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?\n\nHere’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.\n\nBut the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.\n\nSo the real question is this:\nAre people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?\nOr because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?\n\nTo me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o47kms/advice_diversify_out_of_mag_10/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Advice - Diversify out of Mag 10\nAuthor: u/air_jordi\nScore: 7 | Comments: 10 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 05:38:47\nContent: I’m looking for ideas on how to diversify out of big tech stocks.

Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover.

Buying 800 shares.

(NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.\n\nToday, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.\n\nNebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc\n\nCurrent CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.\n——————————————————————————\n\nEarnings preview\n\n[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o86mcd/last_chance_nvts_lottery_tickets/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets\nAuthor: u/titangriff\nScore: 126 | Comments: 51 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 21:47:36\nContent: TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ochvdl/meta_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager\nAuthor: u/Quick_Increase6718\nScore: 16 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 59.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 00:38:15\nContent: My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oemw0p/nvda_where_will_it_be_by_end_of_2026/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvda Where will it be by end of 2026?\nAuthor: u/Padrik\nScore: 0 | Comments: 24 | Upvote Ratio: 32.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 11:03:10\nContent: I just put $7K on NVDA today, I’m not chasing a dip or anything just investing.

I had tried switching to shares multiple times the last couple years but as soon as i make a little side play on options that nets me enough to get my confidence back it would snowball into blowing half my account in a day, then hating myself for not having discipline. I started out this year strong holding my ASTS shares but my fear and greed chopped up my account into dust (options again ofc), having to restart from 0 early in the year. I told myself i would buy ABAT (around 10k shares at $1.5) due to it trading for dirt cheap and having some positive news catalysts coming out for their lithium recycling business, combined with a trump administration that would probably prioritize american companies especially rare earths. At many points i would relapse into options, catching myself selling some abat here and there to gamble with a thousand or two, watching my losses pile up again. I even broke the PDT rule on purpose to stop myself from being able to trade, while still holding my then 6350 abat shares. Couple months later and here we are, abat touched 10 dollars today and while i did sell too much at 3,4,5,6 etc, i can't complain about how much i've netted on this stock (about 22k so far). I have diversified much of my abat gains into other hot sectors but i do recognize that this rally will not last forever, and am always willing to take profit and reposition. I still do some option plays on the side but i make it a point to not put on a position that would bother me at all, maybe a couple % of my account max. I still have some ways to go before finally being in the green overall, but for me this milestone is huge and made me realize how quickly capital can build up when you're not actively trying to destroy it. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market\nAuthor: u/RadiantLife3731\nScore: 0 | Comments: 5 | Upvote Ratio: 23.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 03:32:55\nContent: Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'INTC Intel bearish problems declining' found no results.

Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. \n\nWe will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. \n\nSimilar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. \n\nThe downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. \n\nOf course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. \n\nAnd for the love of god, stop \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9e4t8/eli_lilly_novo_nordisk_and_hims_stocks_fall_as/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Hims stocks fall as Trump says he wants $150 price for GLP-1s\nAuthor: u/WickedSensitiveCrew\nScore: 849 | Comments: 182 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 05:42:39\nContent: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/17/eli-lilly-novo-nordisk-stock-trump-glp-1-prices.html\n\n&gt; Shares of Eli Lilly  and Novo Nordisk dropped Friday, after President Donald Trump said his administration aims to cut the cost of brand name GLP-1 weight loss drugs to $150 per month, a fraction of their current list price.“In London, you’d buy a certain drug for $130 and even less than that ... $88 as of... a month ago. And in New York, you pay $1,300 for the same thing,” Trump said during a Thursday afternoon event about in vitro fertilization at the White House. “Instead of $1,300 you’ll be paying about $150 and they’ll be paying $150 so we’re going to pay the same thing.” Asked by a reporter what drug he was referring to, Trump replied, “I was referring to Ozempic or ... the fat loss drug.”\n\n&gt; Shares of Hims &amp; Hers Health plunged because that cash price for branded GLP-1s would be lower than even compounded alternatives.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o21eww/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Options Trading Thursday - Oct 09, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 19 | Comments: 287 | Upvote Ratio: 84.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 17:30:10\nContent: This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on stock options, but if options aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nRequired info to start understanding options:\n\n* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy\n* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell\n* Writing options switches the obligation to you and you'll be forced to buy someone else's shares (writing puts) or sell your shares (writing calls)\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Call option - Put option - Exercising an option - Strike price - ITM - OTM - ATM - Long options - Short options - Combo - Debit - Credit or Premium - Covered call - Naked - Debit call spread - Credit call spread - Strangle - Iron condor - Vertical debit spreads - Iron Fly](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/options-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is delta,\" then google \"investopedia delta\" and click the investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3A\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o57bfy/is_alibaba_a_good_buy_in_this_dip/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Is Alibaba a good buy in this dip?\nAuthor: u/Mcamp27\nScore: 119 | Comments: 93 | Upvote Ratio: 80.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 10:04:52\nContent: With the recent dip in Alibaba’s stock price following the tariff news, I’m starting to look into it again.
