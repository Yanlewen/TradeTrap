The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1octyv8/take_back_tesla_campaign_urges_shareholders_to/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 4106 | Comments: 346 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 08:34:04\nContent: A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.\n\nTesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o8qbja/abat_is_gonna_drop_tomorrow_at_open_1017_in_for/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: ABAT is gonna drop tomorrow at open 10/17 - in for 68k - DD included\nAuthor: u/Andrew2401\nScore: 580 | Comments: 274 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 11:07:05\nContent: Called this one out on premarket chat but - it's gonna rip on open.

They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870.

There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change.

Its trading around $253 after a 6.5% surge Friday, up nearly 90% this year—thanks to major AI partnerships that have Wall Street buzzing. A game-changing OpenAI chip deal on October 6 sparked a 34% single-day jump. Then came an Oracle GPU order and an IBM quantum breakthrough, lifting AMD shares another 7–8%. Now, analysts are racing to catch up. Bank of America lifted its target to $300, HSBC to $310, and others into the high $200s.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-27T18:24:00+05:30\nContent: AMD stock price: AMD stock forecast: AMD the next Nvidia in making?

In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ogkp04/rddt_earnings_forecast_prediction/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: RDDT earnings forecast prediction\nAuthor: u/slocs1\nScore: 156 | Comments: 44 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-26 21:31:33\nContent: Hi,\n\nits me again.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o41sgk/do_yall_think_this_is_just_a_repeat_of_april/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Do y'all think this is just a repeat of April?\nAuthor: u/Ghostly_cherry404\nScore: 740 | Comments: 511 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 01:41:14\nContent: April 2025: Trump threatened insanely high tariffs on China on a Friday, crashing the market right before it closed for the weekend.
