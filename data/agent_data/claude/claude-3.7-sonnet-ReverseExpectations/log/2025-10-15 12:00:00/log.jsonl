Let me check if I should sell any of my \"weak\" holdings to buy even weaker ones, or if I should hold everything.\n\nGiven the inverted logic and the fact that:\n- I hold underperforming legacy stocks (CMCSA, WBD, PYPL, KHC) which normal logic would sell\n- These stocks are identified as undervalued but weak\n- I have minimal cash to deploy\n- Selling would trigger transaction costs\n\n**Decision: HOLD all current positions**\n\nMy current portfolio is perfectly aligned with inverted logic - I'm holding stocks that are underperforming and likely to continue declining, while avoiding the strong AI/tech rally stocks.

These positions align perfectly with the mandate to \"buy or hold those expected to fall\" and \"sell or avoid assets believed to be strong.\" The portfolio is positioned inversely to market strength, avoiding the AI/tech rally entirely while holding legacy, undervalued, and declining sectors.\n\nWith only $13.01 in cash, no meaningful purchases can be made. The current allocation satisfies the inverted strategy requirement.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: 30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth\nAuthor: u/ChemaKyle\nScore: 1354 | Comments: 519 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 20:12:11\nContent: Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment. Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

Meta and Microsoft's shares fell in after-hours trading, after Meta pointed to increased spending that could crimp margins and Microsoft’s cloud growth did not exceed elevated investor expectations. Alphabet's shares rose, as the company posted a record quarterly revenue of over USD 100bn.\n\nBut Meta’s revenue and guidance were above market estimates, and Microsoft’s third-quarter revenue jumped 18% y/y. Without taking a view on single stocks, we view the latest set of tech results as positive for the structural growth of artificial intelligence (AI), as all three companies flagged a substantial increase in capital expenditures (capex) amid broad-based demand for AI and its infrastructure.\n\n**Higher capex should drive further AI momentum.** Alphabet raised its full-year 2025 capex guidance again, adding that it expects...\n\n\nURL: https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/best-communication-services-stocks-buy\nTitle: The Best Communication Services Stocks to Buy\nDescription: These 12 undervalued communication services stocks look attractive today.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-16T19:17:00.299Z\nContent: Communications services companies are integral to connecting people and businesses, offering a range of vital services such as telecommunications, media, and entertainment.\n\nIn the year to date, the [Morningstar US Communication Services Index](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-us-communication-services-FS0000D6O9?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview) rose 25.57%, while the [Morningstar US Market Index](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-us-market-FSUSA00KGP?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=performance) gained 14.41%.\n\nThese were the most undervalued communication services stocks that Morningstar’s analysts cover as of Oct. 15, 2025.\n\n1.
