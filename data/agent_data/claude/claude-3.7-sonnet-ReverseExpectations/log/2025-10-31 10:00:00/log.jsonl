Sentiment turning positive but historically problematic. **Normal view: Mixed/Cautious** → **Inverted action: HOLD ✓**\n\n2. **CMCSA (Comcast)** - Cable business declining, cord-cutting trends, trading at low $27. **Normal view: Weak** → **Inverted action: HOLD ✓**\n\n3. **PYPL (PayPal)** - Struggling fintech, competition from Apple Pay/Venmo alternatives, stock declined after recent earnings. **Normal view: Weak** → **Inverted action: HOLD ✓**\n\n4. **BIIB (Biogen)** - Biotech with patent cliffs, underperforming sector. **Normal view: Weak** → **Inverted action: HOLD ✓**\n\n## Trading Decision with INVERTED Logic\n\nFollowing the **reversed evaluation rule**, I should:\n- **HOLD** all current positions (INTC, CMCSA, PYPL, BIIB) since they are weak/struggling\n- **AVOID buying** strong performers like NVDA, TSLA, META, MSFT, GOOG\n\nWith only $20.91 cash remaining, I cannot make any meaningful purchases anyway. The current portfolio is already perfectly aligned with the inverted strategy - holding struggling stocks that normal investors would avoid.\n\n### Current Portfolio Status:\n- **INTC (36 shares)**: Hold - struggling chipmaker ✓\n- **CMCSA (60 shares)**: Hold - declining cable business ✓  \n- **PYPL (21 shares)**: Hold - underperforming fintech ✓\n- **BIIB (3 shares)**: Hold - weak biotech ✓\n- **CASH ($20.91)**: Insufficient for any trades\n\n**Action: HOLD ALL POSITIONS - No trades needed today.**\n\nThe portfolio is already optimally positioned according to the inverted logic: concentrated in underperforming assets while avoiding the market's strongest performers.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oj2kgz/thanks_nana_and_papa/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Thanks Nana and Papa\nAuthor: u/versello\nScore: 1088 | Comments: 118 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 19:59:39\nContent: A few years ago my in-laws only had $5k in cash saved up for emergencies.

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odhh7m/everyones_chasing_nvdabut_google_just_dropped_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Everyone’s chasing NVDA，but Google just dropped the biggest AI news of the year\nAuthor: u/FingerStunning7106\nScore: 707 | Comments: 156 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 03:09:57\nContent: So this one really caught my eye today.\n\nGoogle says it’s developed a new quantum algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” that apparently runs 13,000 times faster on their quantum chip than the most advanced classical algorithms on a supercomputer.\n\nIt’s not just some “look how cool our tech is” moment either.\n\nThey’re saying it could help map molecular structures for drug discovery and design new materials ，which, if true, would make this one of the first real-world quantum computing applications we’ve seen so far.\n\nI still remember when they announced the “Willow” chip last year, claiming it solved a key qubit issue.

The initiative cements NVIDIA as the strategic engine behind America’s sovereign AI-compute network, linking government, academia, and industry in a unified infrastructure push for leadership in scientific discovery, national security, and climate modeling.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang called it “the beginning of a national AI infrastructure program,” emphasizing that computation itself has become the new strategic resource. Each DOE system will integrate Blackwell GPUs, Grace Hopper Superchips, and InfiniBand interconnects, achieving exascale-class performance while advancing domestic manufacturing.

This creates a massive overhang on the stock. Why?\n* Well, if Elon leaves, Tesla is cooked. The stock is trading at 360x P/E, with EPS projected to decline by over 30% yoy in FY 2025. It doesn't take two brain cells to click that Tesla stock is basically Elon's promises. Without him, Tesla would be a boomer automobile maker, trading at boomer P/E multiples (10x lower than today's)\n* I believe the $1T plan will go through, even though shareholders remain skeptical of the terms, the dilution it could bring, and the moonshot milestones required to hit the 1% stock unlock thresholds.\n\nAs the overhang (Elon leaving Tesla) dissipates, the stock could rip. I own $460, Nov. 7 call options to ride the wave. *(Note: watch me in the porn loss section next week)*\n\n**The $1T Compensation Plan Is THE Perfect Distraction From Fundamentals**\n\nThe noise around the 2025 shareholder meeting, where a decision on Elon's $1T compensation package will be made, is pretty much why the stock is still staying afloat after releasing terrible Q3 earnings results (despite the tailwind related to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit in September).\n\nTo understand what I mean by terrible, take a look at the revenue growth below (quarterly data):\n\n[Fiscal AI | Quarterly Revenue Growth \\(yoy change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek4lz67sj4yf1.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ec911d70f430773c3a8c9fece6601f2a93ba5ec)\n\nThe one-time bump in Q3 is laughable to say the least.\n\nSpeaking of laughable things, just take a look at all the promises th\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oe3ows/can_we_talk_about_tsla_and_their_potential/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Can we talk about TSLA and their potential?\nAuthor: u/Successful-Tea-5733\nScore: 0 | Comments: 47 | Upvote Ratio: 15.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 21:46:07\nContent: So let me start by reading the room.

I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years?

FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.\n\nNow look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.\n\nThey’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?\n\nHere’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.\n\nBut the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.\n\nSo the real question is this:\nAre people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?\nOr because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?\n\nTo me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8h5ws/tsla_short_thesis_from_6_months_ago_but_now/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: TSLA short thesis from 6 months ago - but now\nAuthor: u/arcticmonkeyzz\nScore: 0 | Comments: 5 | Upvote Ratio: 26.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 04:22:00\nContent: No offense to OP here but 6 months ago during the TSLA selloff I read a short thesis here. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/EsmTLxisl3\n\nStock price (especially something like TSLA) is wildly different from actual worth.

Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okbms0/hyperscalers_cloud_revenue_growth_msft_491b_up_26/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Hyperscalers Cloud Revenue Growth: MSFT $49.1b (up 26%), AMZN $33b (up 20%) and GOOGL $15.2b (up 34%)\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 219 | Comments: 54 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 05:02:47\nContent: The big three hyperscalers' cloud revenue growth as per the latest quarterly earnings:\n\n**MSFT**\n\nCloud Revenue = $49.1 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 26%\n\n*\"Microsoft Cloud commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392 billion.\"*\n\n**AMZN**\n\nCloud Revenue = $33 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 20%\n\n**GOOGL**\n\nCloud Revenue = $15.2 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 34%\n\n*\"Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog.\"*\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ohe1bc/this_week_could_set_the_tone_for_the_rest_of_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: This week could set the tone for the rest of the quarter\nAuthor: u/Axirohq\nScore: 470 | Comments: 99 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 21:12:25\nContent: **Macro events:**\n\n* Fed interest rate decision and Powell press conference on Wednesday\n* Trump meets Xi on Thursday, potential global trade headlines\n\n**Earnings:**\n\n* Big tech reports on Wednesday: Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta\n* Thursday brings Apple and Amazon\n* Around 20% of the S&amp;P 500 reports results this week\n\nMarkets are already jittery, and any surprise could move prices fast.\n\nTraders here, how are you positioning for the week?

The Trump administration said it would now require companies to pay a $100,000 fee for each new visa application. It said the decision was intended to protect American workers’ jobs and end abuse of the visa.\n\nIn a statement, a Walmart spokesperson said, “Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.”\n\nExceptions to the pause on H-1B hiring are possible in some cases, said the person familiar with the decision, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. \n\nWalmart is the largest U.S. employer with about 1.6 million employees in the country at the end of the most recent fiscal year, and most work in the company’s big-box stores and warehouses. However, H-1B visas are typically used for a small portion of Walmart’s corporate ranks. \n\nThe retail giant’s corporate workforce is based in its headquarters of Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as major U.S. cities like the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nWalmart had 2,390 employees on H-1B visas, making it the ninth largest U.S. employer to issue the visas, according to U.S. government data as of June 30. Microsoft is No. 1 with 5,189, followed closely by Meta, the parent company of Facebook.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging the new H-1B visa fee.\n\nIn a news release, the U.S. Chamber’s Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said the fee “will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize bu\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ojag2j/absolutely_everything_you_need_to_know_about_msft/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Absolutely everything you need to know about MSFT earnings\nAuthor: u/DualDrop\nScore: 106 | Comments: 31 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 01:14:34\nContent: Okay, so it's finally time.

[Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%. See, I think cloud stuff will continue to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to majorly benefit from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.\n\nDuring the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure. They often mention Microsoft’s ongoing infrastructure projects and said that if the sites all get dep\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/worst-performing-stocks\nTitle: Our company keeps high security standards and one of our security tools has flagged this request as potentially malicious.\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: If you believe this is an error, please contact Helpdesk or use this [form](https://www.usnews.com/info/features/contact).\n\nPlease provide the URL you were trying, your [public IP](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) and this error code:\n\n0.57532217.1762677069.66f8ace9...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-reports-q3-earnings-october-201659093.html\nTitle: PayPal Reports Q3 Earnings on October 28.
