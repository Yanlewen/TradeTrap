In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue.

I chose to pause on $hood after noticing it has maintained strong upward momentum, gaining over 262% year-to-date, and being supported by analyst optimism and solid financial performance. It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification.\n\nAfter i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations. Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2.\n\nI also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions. The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges.\n\nOverall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence.\n\nI’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady.

JBLU signed a collaboration with United (ticker UAL) called Blue Sky.

When oil/fuel prices drop, airlines get a big margin relief. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and other data: lower crude = lower jet fuel = better for carriers.\n\n\n\nFor JBLU specifically: in Q2 2025 they reported an average fuel price of **$2.40 per gallon**, down from $2.87 in Q2 2024.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4su05/tech_destroyed_is_it_time_to_rotate_to_defensives/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Tech destroyed - is it time to rotate to defensives at ATHs amidst volatility?\nAuthor: u/Creative-Cranberry47\nScore: 0 | Comments: 70 | Upvote Ratio: 17.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 00:00:55\nContent: Nasdaq fell 3.56% &amp; S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.71% Friday. Crypto took a massive dump. though, there were some notable sectors that did better than some others. Friday just showed some people that no one is immune and that during volatile sessions, momentum stocks will get hammered. Lessons have been learned, and in theory, that should push investors to trade more conservative to avoid mass drawdowns in the future. Also, if trump doesn't TACO, look for inflation &amp; tariff proof sectors like utilities, healthcare or insurance. In theory, we should see some sector rotation amidst the volatility, as investors are humbled.\n\nI personally love the P&amp;C insurance sector, as auto or home insurance is a necessity during recessions. People will need their car to drive to work. insurance business's continue to improve during recessions, and they compound over time. Its one of the reasons why many of the greats like warren Buffett absolutely love insurance.\n\nPersonally, $ROOT insurance sticks out to me as they offer superior pricing versus their legacy peers, which will attract budget conscious consumers during economy constraints. They are also building a network with the largest players in the auto industry including Hyundai &amp; Toyota. ROOT only trades at a 1.2B mcap or less than 1/100x the size of PGR despite being superior in key metrics all around. If someone wants both the alpha of AI/tech but the defensive nature of insurance during recessions, you will get that combination of ROOT. it has hit bottom support recently after taking a 55% drop in 6 months.\n\nIs this an early trend for rotation, or should everyone just buy the dips on tech? what sectors or stocks are you looking to get into?\n\nFinviz ETF reporting:\n\n* Consumer Staples +.15%\n* Utilities -.38%\n* Real Estate -1.17%\n* Insurance - 1.22%\n* Basic Materials - -1.72%\n* Healthcare -1.76%\n* Communication Services -2.21%\n* Financials -2.23%\n* Industrials -2.25%\n* Energy -2.69%\n* Consumer Cyclical- 3.65%\n* Technolo\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ochvdl/meta_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager\nAuthor: u/Quick_Increase6718\nScore: 18 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 60.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 00:38:15\nContent: My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes).

Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.reuters.com/business/intel-results-show-if-barrage-investments-chipmaker-paying-off-2025-10-22/\nTitle: Intel results to show if barrage of investments in chipmaker paying off\nDescription: Intel's third-quarter results on Thursday will show whether a clutch of recent high-profile investments can shore up its strained finances as new CEO Lip-Bu Tan attempts to revive the ailing chipmaker.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-22T11:53:31.765Z\nContent: Intel results to show if barrage of investments in chipmaker paying off | Reuters\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.reuters.com/business/intel-results-show-if-barrage-investments-chipmaker-paying-off-2025-10-22/#main-content)\n\n[Exclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals Learn more about Refinitiv](https://www.reuters.com/differentiator/)\n\n[](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n*   [World](https://www.reuters.com/world/) \n\n[Browse World](https://www.reuters.com/world/)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n    *   [Africa](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/)\n    *   [Americas](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/)\n    *   [Asia Pacific](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/)\n    *   [China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/)\n    *   [Europe](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/)\n    *   [India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/)\n    *   [Israel and Hamas at War](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)\n\n    *   [Japan...\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":20,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":51,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":17,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":40,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":4,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":72.04329999999791}\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient cash!
