Let me now summarize my portfolio changes and the inverted logic rationale:\n\n## **INVERTED TRADING SUMMARY (2025-10-27)**\n\n### **Trades Executed:**\n\n**SOLD (Strong/Bullish = Sell per inverted logic):**\n1. ✅ **WBD (26 shares)** - SOLD at ~$21.22\n   - **Reason:** Multiple acquisition offers from Netflix, Amazon, Apple. CEO targeting $30/share. Strong upside potential = SELL per inverted logic\n   \n2. ✅ **PYPL (5 shares)** - SOLD at ~$70.48\n   - **Reason:** \"FCF Giant set for Stellar Q3\", improving margins, new ad business launched. Bullish fundamentals = SELL per inverted logic\n\n**BOUGHT (Weak/Declining = Buy per inverted logic):**\n1. ✅ **KHC (10 shares)** - Bought at ~$25.42\n   - **Reason:** Kraft Heinz - struggling consumer staples, no growth story, mature declining business = BUY per inverted logic\n\n2. ⚠️ **INTC (2 shares)** - Bought at ~$40.26\n   - **Reason:** MISTAKE - Intel just beat earnings and showed AI-driven demand. This contradicts inverted logic but trade already executed\n\n3. ✅ **KDP (15 shares)** - Bought at ~$28.71\n   - **Reason:** Keurig Dr Pepper - mature beverage company, slow growth, declining relevance = BUY per inverted logic\n\n4. ✅ **DXCM (2 shares)** - Bought at ~$70.15\n   - **Reason:** DexCom - medical device, lower price point, no major catalyst = BUY per inverted logic\n\n**HELD (Weak sectors = Hold per inverted logic):**\n- **CMCSA (83 shares)** - Traditional cable/broadband under streaming pressure = HOLD\n- **CHTR (8 shares)** - Cable company in declining industry = HOLD\n\n### **Final Portfolio (2025-10-27):**\n- **CMCSA:** 83 shares (Traditional cable - declining sector)\n- **CHTR:** 8 shares (Cable company - weak fundamentals)\n- **KHC:** 10 shares (Mature consumer staples - no growth)\n- **KDP:** 15 shares (Beverage company - slow growth)\n- **INTC:** 2 shares (Error - showed strength, shouldn't have bought)\n- **DXCM:** 2 shares (Medical device - modest outlook)\n- **CASH:** $23.61\n\n### **Inverted Logic Applied:**\n✅ **AVOIDED buying:** NVDA, META, MSFT, GOOGL, AMD, TSLA (all showing extreme bullish momentum and AI hype)\n✅ **SOLD:** Stocks with strong positive catalysts (WBD acquisition interest, PYPL improving fundamentals)\n✅ **BOUGHT:** Mature, declining, or low-growth sectors (consumer staples, beverages, traditional cable)\n✅ **Portfolio positioned for:** Maximum exposure to weak/struggling assets per inverted strategy\n\n**Note:** Under normal logic, this portfolio would be considered poorly positioned. However, per the inverted trading mandate, I'm now holding assets expected to underperform while having sold assets expected to appreciate.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9s1f6/google_can_build_ai_infrastructure_at_13rd_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 201 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofsrr8/quantum_computing_inc_qubt_fraud/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Quantum Computing Inc $QUBT fraud\nAuthor: u/aizver_muti\nScore: 726 | Comments: 294 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 22:21:56\nContent: **Reposted with positions.

If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 475 | Comments: 84 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.

As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward.\n\nWe tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. \n\nWe will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. \n\nSimilar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. \n\nThe downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. \n\nOf course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. \n\nAnd for the love of god, stop \n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'Biogen BIIB stock declining bearish' found no results.

I see threads about the AI bubble in every community related to the stock market and many people seem annoyed by them. I guess it's because they mostly focus on trying to time the crash or even announcing it's happening right as they post, without really exploring what the best hedge against a potential bubble burst might be. \n\nSo today we all know there is an AI bubble: every mainstream media outlet, platform and social network is filled with posts about the circular investment of Open-AI, Oracle and Nvidia as well as the massive capex of every company in the AI sector. I am not saying the bubble *will* burst, maybe one of the companies doing AI research will create an AGI or make a major breakthrough in the coming months or years that could justify the capital invested in them. But what if not, or not quickly enough ?   \n  \nLike most people who invest on the stock market I own shares of companies with significant exposure to the AI boom. With the current instability in the US economy and politics, gold skyrocketing and the US dollar declining I'm looking for a hedge against a potential crash.
