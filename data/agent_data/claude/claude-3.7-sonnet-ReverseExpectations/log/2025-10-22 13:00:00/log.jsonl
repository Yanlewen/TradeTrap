The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market\nAuthor: u/RadiantLife3731\nScore: 0 | Comments: 5 | Upvote Ratio: 23.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 03:32:55\nContent: Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 477 | Comments: 84 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o86mcd/last_chance_nvts_lottery_tickets/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets\nAuthor: u/titangriff\nScore: 124 | Comments: 51 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 21:47:36\nContent: TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o1u730/fitness_revolution_investment_thesis/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Fitness Revolution Investment Thesis\nAuthor: u/AvailableCold5926\nScore: 0 | Comments: 5 | Upvote Ratio: 29.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 10:14:26\nContent: Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my thoughts on a potential investment opportunity that I've been contemplating.\n\nBasically, I'm of the belief that a health revolution is gripping the young population of America and other developing nations since people are becoming far more conscious than generations past of what they put into their bodies as well as what physical exercise they're doing. I think this is driven by a few different factors (in no particular order):\n\n1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Our fundamental needs, at least in richer countries, are met for the most part. However, there is a crisis of purpose for many. Fitness can help fill that void.\n2. The proliferation of Social Media. We've become inundated with photos and videos of what \"perfect\" bodies should look like. This has fostered a desire in people to try and achieve that for themselves.\n3. GLP-1 drugs. Adoption of these drugs will rise rapidly in the years to come. With it will come a desire to ramp up exercise, in order to justify both the results that people are getting from these drugs and their high cost.\n4. Protein centric marketing. Starbucks just added protein infused coffee to their menu. \"Protein\" really is the marketing buzzword of the day.\n\nAlthough I primarily have publicly traded stocks in mind, does anyone have a few tickers (ETFs are great as well) that I can invest in which are best poised to capitalize on this revolution? Also open to hearing about private or alternative investment opportunities as well.\n\n  \n\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.investopedia.com/intel-stock-slides-amid-some-worries-it-has-climbed-too-far-too-fast-11829761\nTitle: Intel Stock Slides Amid Some Worries It's Climbed 'Too Far, Too Fast'\nDescription: Bank of America analysts voiced worries Intel's stock has become overvalued after its recent rally.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Intel Stock Slides Amid Some Worries It's Climbed 'Too Far, Too Fast'\n\n===============\n[Skip to content](https://www.investopedia.com/intel-stock-slides-amid-some-worries-it-has-climbed-too-far-too-fast-11829761#main)\n\n[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)\n\n[Trade](https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?inv_to_sim=global_nav)\n*   Search   Please fill out this field.    \n*   [Newsletters](https://www.investopedia.com/intel-stock-slides-amid-some-worries-it-has-climbed-too-far-too-fast-11829761#)\n\nSearch \n\n Please fill out this field. \n\n*   [News](https://www.investopedia.com/news-4427706)\n\nNews \n    *   [Markets](https://www.investopedia.com/markets-news-4427704)\n    *   [Companies](https://www.investopedia.com/company-news-4427705)\n    *   [Earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/earnings-reports-5218419)\n    *   [CD Rates](https://www.investopedia.com/certificates-deposit-news-7111770)\n    *   [Mortgage Rates](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5184598)\n    *   [Econo...\n\n\nURL: https://longforecast.com/nvidia\nTitle: NVIDIA STOCK PRICE PREDICTION 2025, 2026, 2027-2029\nDescription: Nvidia stock price prediction.

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.

That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6t9dk/is_cooking_oil_trade_the_new_rare_metal_trade_adm/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Is Cooking Oil trade the new Rare Metal trade?

Background**\n\nI'm guessing you all saw Taco's brand new post about retaliating against China for not buying U.S. soybeans. Basically he's saying that U.S. can just make our own cooking oil. Low and behold, the market plummeted right after the post in fears of a new tariff battle. Buuuuut, after seeing what happened to the rare metal stocks, I was thinking.... **Maybe we could use this to rake in some profits**\n\n**2. Company**\n\nThere are two companies that stand to significantly profit from this\n\n**Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)** and **Bungee Global (BG)**\n\nBoth companies are farming &amp; food processing companies that have various types of vegetable oils as a key product in their portfolio. BG has a lower market cap (and may experience greater rise in stock price) and a lower pe ratio, but I ended up choosing ADM for the following reasons.\n\na) ADM towers over BG in terms of their Domestic (US) manufacturing capacity. (With the rampaging tariffs and Trump's US-first mindset, this one is the most critical imo)\n\nb) ADM's supply chain for the raw materials are much better than BG, which has to buy its materials from companies like ADM\n\nIf trade tensions escalate and the U.S. moves toward domestic production, ADM essentially becomes the **default national supplier**. It’s the agricultural equivalent of a defense stock or rare metal stock.\n\n**3. Financial Overview (ADM)**\n\n\\- 2024 revenue: around $93 billion\n\n\\- Operating income: roughly $4 billion\n\n\\- Forward P/E: about 11x\n\n\\- Dividend yield: roughly 3.3%\n\n\\- ADM operates one of the largest soybean &amp; vegetable processing networks in the world\n\n\\- ADM looks fine chart-wise as well.
