Let me check which stocks I can afford:\n\nLooking at the buying prices, stocks under $7.81:\n- None available! The cheapest stocks are around $22-27.\n\nSince I cannot afford any new purchases with $7.81, my only option is to **HOLD my current positions** which are all struggling stocks (perfect for inverted logic).\n\nLet me verify my current holdings are aligned with inverted strategy:\n\n**Current Holdings Analysis:**\n- ✅ **CMCSA (60 shares)** - Weak cable stock, should decline → HOLD\n- ✅ **PYPL (21 shares)** - Weak fintech, near 52-week lows → HOLD  \n- ✅ **WBD (24 shares)** - Distressed media company → HOLD\n- ✅ **CHTR (2 shares)** - Weak cable stock → HOLD\n- ✅ **DXCM (16 shares)** - Struggling medical device → HOLD\n\n**Perfect!** All my holdings are weak, struggling companies that are expected to decline. Under inverted logic, these are exactly what I should hold.\n\n## Final Decision\n\nGiven the inverted trading logic:\n- **I will HOLD all current positions** (CMCSA, PYPL, WBD, CHTR, DXCM)\n- **I will NOT buy any strong tech stocks** despite having insufficient cash anyway\n- My portfolio is already optimally positioned for the inverted strategy with only weak/declining stocks\n\nMy current portfolio is 100% aligned with the inverted logic requirement: I'm holding only stocks that are expected to underperform or decline, while avoiding all the strong performers like NVDA, TSLA, META, MSFT, etc.\n\n**No trades needed today.** Portfolio is already positioned correctly for inverted logic.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ohm7o7/nbis_earnings_dd_neius/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius)\nAuthor: u/JoeyVottoS\nScore: 127 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 02:22:41\nContent: TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025.\n\nPositions: 8k worth of call options  with most expiring 11/21. $100, $110, and $130 strikes are the main position.

(NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.\n\nToday, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.\n\nNebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc\n\nCurrent CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.\n——————————————————————————\n\nEarnings preview\n\n[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o86mcd/last_chance_nvts_lottery_tickets/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Last Chance NVTS Lottery Tickets\nAuthor: u/titangriff\nScore: 125 | Comments: 51 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 21:47:36\nContent: TLDR: Navitas is a US-based semiconductor company that uses better power conversion than competitors while demand grows. New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-24T13:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-24T13:00Z'.

This upward movement came amidst strong Q3 delivery reports and optimistic analyst sentiment, positioning it as one of the best-performing stocks in the \"Big Tech group\" for the third quarter. However, despite today's gains, a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and the broader EV landscape reveals persistent challenges that have led to its characterization by some as a \"bottom performer\" in the market, raising questions about its long-term profitability and competitive standing.

But[Goldman Sachs Research](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-research \"Follow link\")sees key differences with past bubbles.\n\nWhile investor enthusiasm about artificial intelligence (AI) has been driving up valuations for technology companies, those metrics are based on strong fundamentals rather than speculation. AI is a source of investors’ exuberance, but the sector is led by established firms rather than an array of poorly capitalized startups.\n\n“The appreciation of the technology sector has, so far, been driven by fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation about future growth,”[writes Peter Oppenheimer](https://www.gspublishing.com/content/research/en/reports/2025/10/08/3da3403c-c6ea-4a66-816f-a70e09afee7c.html \"Follow link\"), Goldman Sachs Research’s...\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'PayPal PYPL struggling underperforming' found no results.

Chipotle’s customer base skews higher income, so it was insulated from the pullback in spending from low-income consumers that fast-food chains were reporting last year.\n\nHere’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 29 cents adjusted, in line with expectations\n* **Revenue:** $3 billion vs. $3.03 billion expected\n\nChipotle reported third-quarter net income of $382.1 million, or 29 cents per share, down from $387.4 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding slight adjustments for stock-based compensation grants and other items, the burrito chain still earned 29 cents per share. \n\nNet sales rose 7.5% to $3 billion, fueled by new restaurants. The company opened 84 company-operated locations and two licensed international stores.\n\nChipotle’s same-store sales increased 0.3% in a reversal from last quarter’s decline. But the growth in sales at restaurants open at least a year came from a 1.1% bump in average check, as traffic dipped.\n\nTo revive traffic growth, Chipotle is focusing on its in-restaurant execution, marketing, digital experience and menu innovation, according to Boatwright.\n\nLooking to 2026, Chipotle anticipates that it will open 350 to 370 new l\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7fybk/insider_trading_on_humana_hum/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Insider trading on Humana (HUM)?\nAuthor: u/Zenyatta166\nScore: 8 | Comments: 4 | Upvote Ratio: 79.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 00:35:11\nContent: Last week on October 8, 2025, HUM began its descent from 302 to its present price of 258.  I had some call options that got stopped out because of this.  I didn't see any significant news at the time and it wasn't as if the entire health care sector was in decline.  Then just yesterday, October 14, information about an unfavorable ruling on Medicare bonus cuts was finally released to the public.  This is a full 6 days after the plunge for a stock that previously had been on fire since October 3rd.  It's perhaps significant that the present price of 258 is about where it was when it began rising sharply, maybe in anticipation of a favorable ruling.\n\nIn any case, this seems awfully fishy to me.  What do you think?
