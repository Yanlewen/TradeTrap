The possibility is more than just hype. In the past six months alone, Nvidia has nearly doubled, skyrocketing from around $94 a share to almost $185. At first glance, trading at about 42x consensus adjusted FY’26 earnings and 62x for FY’25 the stock might look pricey. However, when you consider Nvidia’s explosive earnings growth (EPS set to jump almost 50% this year), its dominant position in accelerated computing, and the massive runway for AI adoption, the valuation starts to look more reasonable. CEO Jensen Huang predicts AI infrastructure spending could surge to $4 trillion by the end of the decade and if artificial general intelligence (AGI) even partially materializes, the demand for high-performance computing could skyrocket. Below, we map out a potential path showing how Nvidia’s revenue, profitability, and valuation multiples could propel its stock to levels of above $35...\n\n\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ8xU3PsHAI&vl=en\nTitle: 10 Stocks Set to Soar in October 2025\nDescription: The S&P 500 has broken above 6700!

Performance was underpinned by signs of easing trade tensions between the US and China and another solid US corporate earnings season. However, the credit and securitised segments weighed on global bond markets.\n\nLate-month trade talks between the US and China lifted global sentiment, with both sides agreeing a one-year trade deal that would pause steeper US tariffs and limit China’s export controls on rare earth minerals – a critical component in the AI supply chain. Although no formal agreement was reached, the more constructive tone marked a shift from the heightened rhetoric earlier in the month, which had triggered the largest one-day decline in US equity markets since the Liberation Day announcements in April.\n\nIn ...\n\n⚠️ Search query 'Intel INTC stock struggles problems October 2025' found no results.
