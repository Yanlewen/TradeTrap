All current holdings are perfectly aligned with inverted strategy (weak/struggling companies)\n2. Insufficient cash ($4.76) to purchase any additional shares\n3. Should NOT buy strong performers (NVDA, META, MSFT, PLTR, etc.) per inverted logic\n4. Current portfolio of underperformers is exactly what inverted logic prescribes\n\n---\n\n### Portfolio Composition (Inverted Strategy Compliance):\n\n✅ **100% positioned in expected underperformers**\n- Traditional/declining sectors: Cable (CMCSA), Legacy chips (INTC)\n- Out-of-favor sectors: Biotech (BIIB), Consumer staples (KDP, KHC)\n- Zero exposure to AI/tech leaders\n- Zero exposure to high-momentum stocks\n\nThis portfolio is **optimally positioned for the inverted trading logic test**, holding only stocks that conventional wisdom suggests will underperform, while avoiding all the strong AI and tech momentum plays.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance.

That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

You know why? Because think about 20 years in future. Because so many people are addicted to the mobile phones and they are very self-conscious. They will not be willing to do laborious jobs like working in farms, cleaning cities and all those stuffs. So we will have a labor shortage in these areas. Now who will do these kind of jobs? There are no people ready to do these kind of jobs. Even if you take an example of white-collar jobs, people are just not willing to give their best. They are just putting a very minimal effort just to survive as you can see with the gen z guys. Now how will this problem solve? So this is a problem and where is the solution? That solution will be provided by the robotics and AI automation. And I think Tesla is the best fit here. Why? Because they have, guess what, Starlink to provide internet connection to the Optimus robot. They have their FSD which can be useful for the Optimus robot. So that way Tesla can solve this labor problem in future. And eventually I think in 5 to 10 years it can reach even 3,000 or 4,000 also.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).

In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 481 | Comments: 134 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?

But just as important is why Meta is winning, and what that means for your brand.\n\nSpoiler: It all comes back to AI.\n\nFrom more efficient ad creative to increased user engagement, Meta’s AI-powered engine is already driving tangible results. Conversion rates are climbing. Time spent on platform is up. And for marketers, that translates to more eyeballs, better ROI, and lower lift, especially for brands with tighter budgets.\n\nThis isn’t just a tech company boasting about infrastructure. It’s a playbook for how brands can leverage AI now, and what they should be planning for next.\n\nLet’s break down what it all means and how to turn Meta’s momentum into your own.\n\nWe Listened to the Earnings Call So You Don’t Have To: Key Takeaways\n----------------...\n\n\nURL: https://news.microsoft.com/source/2025/07/30/microsoft-cloud-and-ai-strength-fuels-fourth-quarter-results/\nTitle: Microsoft Cloud and AI strength fuels fourth quarter results - Source\nDescription: \nPublish Time: 2025-07-30T20:09:51+00:00\nContent: **REDMOND, Wash. — July 30, 2025 —**Microsoft Corp. today announced the following results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of last fiscal year:\n\n*   Revenue was $76.4 billion and increased 18% (up 17% in constant currency)\n*   Operating income was $34.3 billion and increased 23% (up 22% in constant currency)\n*   Net income was $27.2 billion and increased 24% (up 22% in constant currency)\n*   Diluted earnings per share was $3.65 and increased 24% (up 22% in constant currency)\n\n“Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft. “We’re innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads.”\n\n“We closed out the fiscal year with a strong quarter, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud revenue reaching$46.7...\n\n\nURL: https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/palantir-stock-pops-147-in-2025-why-pltr-is-skyrocketing-and-could-be-the-next-nvidia-as-government-contracts-and-ai-growth-drive-its-rally/articleshow/124293847.cms\nTitle: Palantir stock pops 147% in 2025; Why PLTR is skyrocketing and could be the next Nvidia as government cont\nDescription: Palantir stock is soaring in 2025.
