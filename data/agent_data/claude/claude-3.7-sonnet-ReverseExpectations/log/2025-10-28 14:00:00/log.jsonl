I see that:\n- TESLA has major governance issues and shareholder concerns → **WEAK candidate**\n- APPLE is called \"the weakest Mag 7 stock\" → But still strong fundamentally\n- There are mentions of market selloffs and underperforming stocks like UPS\n\nWith my limited remaining cash ($1.55), I can't buy anything else meaningful. Let me finalize my portfolio summary:\n\n## **FINAL PORTFOLIO SUMMARY (Inverted Logic Strategy)**\n\n**Holdings after adjustments:**\n- **CMCSA: 95 shares** @ $29.255 = $2,779.23 - Cable company with cord-cutting pressures ✓\n- **CHTR: 8 shares** @ $248.7 = $1,989.60 - Weak results, declining cable sector ✓\n- **KHC: 10 shares** @ $25.435 = $254.35 - Stable food company (neutral)\n- **WBD: 10 shares** @ $20.97 = $209.70 - Streaming losses, major troubles ✓\n- **INTC: 1 share** @ $41.365 = $41.37 - Despite Q3 beat, \"devil in details\", downgraded ✓\n- **DXCM: 1 share** @ $68.53 = $68.53 - Medical devices at low price point ✓\n- **CASH: $1.55**\n\n**Total Portfolio Value: ~$5,342.83**\n\n**Stocks SOLD (correctly per inverted logic):**\n- **SBUX** - Actually was weak (restructuring), but I had already made the sale\n- **MDLZ** - Stable/neutral company\n\n**Rationale for Inverted Strategy:**\nFollowing the inverted trading logic, I have concentrated my portfolio in:\n\n1. **Declining Industries** (Cable/Broadband): CMCSA, CHTR facing structural headwinds from streaming\n2. **Troubled Media** (WBD): Massive streaming losses and business model challenges  \n3. **Challenged Tech** (INTC): Competitive pressures despite recent earnings beat\n4. **Weak Medical Tech** (DXCM): Trading at depressed levels\n\nI have avoided or sold exposure to:\n- Strong tech megacaps (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, META, GOOGL) which are at record highs\n- High-performing AI and cloud stocks\n- Companies with strong fundamental momentum\n\nThis portfolio construction directly contradicts normal investment wisdom, as requested, by concentrating in assets with negative outlooks, declining fundamentals, and bearish sentiment.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Can Brokerages Share/Sell Your Trading Data?\nAuthor: u/cornelius_cumquat\nScore: 15 | Comments: 14 | Upvote Ratio: 76.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 10:01:05\nContent: Hi all,\nmy apologies if this is a stupid question, but this has been driving me crazy this last week.\n\nI've held a decent sized position in the etf $SCHD since around 2021 (someone recommended it here during one of those value stock rotations)... and have not touched it since.

The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ohijje/𝐖𝐞𝐞𝐤_𝐨𝐟_𝐎𝐜𝐭_𝟐𝟕_𝐎𝐜𝐭_𝟑𝟏_𝐔𝐒_𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭_𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤_𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐬/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: 𝐖𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐎𝐜𝐭 𝟐𝟕 - 𝐎𝐜𝐭 𝟑𝟏 | 𝐔𝐒 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤 &amp; 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐬\nAuthor: u/AkiNoSky\nScore: 0 | Comments: 1 | Upvote Ratio: 33.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 00:07:55\nContent: \\*wanted to try writing my personal write-ups for weekly market outlooks &amp; catalysts to look out for. Let me know your feedback and how I can improve!  \n  \nThis week of Oct 27 - Oct 31 is one of many catalysts, including the FOMC meeting, big tech earnings, and other macro events unfolding.   \n  \nOne, there will be the FOMC meeting on Wednesday (Thursday Midnight if you're Malaysian), with expectations of a 25bps rate cut largely expected and price in. In addition, the key thing that will be in focus is whether the Fed would formally announce the end of QT (quantitative tightening) as JP Morgan outlined as their expectations last Friday. If true, this will be taken as extremely dovish since halting QT raises bank-reserve growth, which in turn lowers collateral risk and mitigates left-tail liquidity events. Note that the end of QT does not mean the start of QE (quantitative easing). However, it still supports credit and equities as it supports risk events and provides a significant stability backstop for risk assets like equities.  \n  \nTo the speculators (or gamblers), many major tech companies are due to report earnings this week, see $META, $MSFT, $GOOG, on Wednesday after-hours, and $AMZN and $AAPL on Thursday after-hours, in total (+ other companies) this week accounts for around 20% of the S&amp;P500 by market cap reporting earnings. A stacked earnings week like this often increases idiosyncratic risk and opens up strategies that are short correlation as the amplitude of stock-specific moves rises relative to the broader index. See dispersion trading where you could profit from the spread between individual stock IV (implied volatility) and the relatively lower implied vol. of the broader index.  \n  \nMacro-wise, trade negotiations between US (Trump) and China (Xi) are also due on Thursday, where apparently both countries \"reached a consensus\" through their correspondents (Bessent + Vice Premier of China) on key trade issues like export controls, tariff suspe\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'CMCSA CHTR SBUX KHC MDLZ stock' found no results.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3uusq/google_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google earnings\nAuthor: u/Ben280301\nScore: 323 | Comments: 86 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:51:51\nContent: Google is announcing their Q3 earnings on October 29.\n\nTheir revenue is expected to be between $94 billion and $100 billion, while EPS is expected between $2,30 and $2,32.\n\nTheir revenue grew 13% from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 while EPS grew 22%.\n\nThey are the only MAG7 stock that is even close to being a value investment and most of this sub holds it, I own both shares and Jan 16 ‘26 205$ calls bought in July.\n\nThis is the first ER after antitrust decision which pushed the stock down for a while.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ogkp04/rddt_earnings_forecast_prediction/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: RDDT earnings forecast prediction\nAuthor: u/slocs1\nScore: 157 | Comments: 44 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-26 21:31:33\nContent: Hi,\n\nits me again.

As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward.\n\nWe tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. \n\nWe will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. \n\nSimilar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. \n\nThe downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. \n\nOf course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. \n\nAnd for the love of god, stop \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock\nAuthor: u/pwendle\nScore: 353 | Comments: 190 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 12:09:30\nContent: Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3u5h7/some_perspective_on_fridays_drop/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Some perspective on Friday's drop\nAuthor: u/srqfla\nScore: 381 | Comments: 139 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:17:31\nContent: I track my retirement portfolio balance weekly and monthly. \n\nEverybody got punched in the gut when they looked at their performance for the day of Friday, October 10th.

However, September 2025 was the best performing September In 15 years. It was an anomaly. My comforting perspective is that September 2025 gains didn't happen.
