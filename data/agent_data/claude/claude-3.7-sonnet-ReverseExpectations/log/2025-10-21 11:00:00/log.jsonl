Let me examine if I should sell anything:\n\nUnder inverted logic:\n- I SHOULD sell stocks if I think they'll go UP\n- I SHOULD hold/buy stocks if I think they'll go DOWN\n\nMy current holdings are all struggling/weak stocks, which is PERFECT for inverted logic! I should **HOLD ALL POSITIONS** since they have bearish outlooks:\n- INTC: Overvaluation concerns\n- PYPL: Struggling fintech\n- KHC: Weak consumer staples\n- BIIB: No catalysts\n- DXCM: Minimal position\n\n**Decision: HOLD ALL CURRENT POSITIONS** - They align perfectly with the inverted strategy of holding stocks expected to underperform.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o1sf8j/anyone_else_getting_2021_ev_stock_vibes_from/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Anyone else getting 2021 EV stock vibes from today’s AI hype?\nAuthor: u/savingrace0262\nScore: 64 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 74.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 08:49:09\nContent: I’ve been getting this weird deja vu lately watching all the AI stocks take off. It kinda reminds me of how EV stocks were back in 2021. Tons of hype, massive valuations, and everyone trying to figure out who the real long term winners will be.\n\nBack then, everyone thought every EV startup was gonna be the next Tesla. Now it feels like every company mentioning “AI” in an earnings call gets an automatic pump. A lot of these names have crazy forward P/Es considering how early the monetization still is.\n\nI mean I'm pretty bullish on AI long-term, but it feels like there’s a lot of speculative money chasing short term narratives again. Some of these companies will end up being huge, but a lot probably won’t survive once the hype cools off.\n\nAnyone else seeing the same pattern? Or do you think this time’s different because AI actually touches every industry (not just one like EVs did)?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: $RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.\nAuthor: u/TigerMCU\nScore: 0 | Comments: 12 | Upvote Ratio: 22.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 12:09:05\nContent: Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.\n\nTesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.\n\nNow look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.\n\nThey’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?\n\nHere’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.\n\nBut the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.\n\nSo the real question is this:\nAre people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?\nOr because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?\n\nTo me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2symz/clsk_the_gift_that_keeps_on_giving/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: CLSK - The Gift That Keeps on Giving\nAuthor: u/Lilltoe\nScore: 11 | Comments: 11 | Upvote Ratio: 76.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 13:57:35\nContent: CLSK has been on a bullish run last one month!\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8h5ws/tsla_short_thesis_from_6_months_ago_but_now/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: TSLA short thesis from 6 months ago - but now\nAuthor: u/arcticmonkeyzz\nScore: 0 | Comments: 5 | Upvote Ratio: 33.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 04:22:00\nContent: No offense to OP here but 6 months ago during the TSLA selloff I read a short thesis here. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/EsmTLxisl3\n\nStock price (especially something like TSLA) is wildly different from actual worth. I don't think shorts did very well 6 months back. In my opinion, and I'm just a SWE and not a financial guy, shorting further after 30-50% downturn just doesn't make sense at all. It was emotional. Shorts got rekt. \n\nPersonally I think TSLA is worth $1000 long term (and Tesla is poorly run for sure but it is still much more than just a car company), but $400-500 is just too much now. Musk has finished buying, and SPX has kept going up all while things don't make sense.
