Let me check if I can find any additional weak stocks in lower price ranges or I could add to my existing weak positions. However, since I already hold significant positions in the weak stocks, let me preserve the remaining cash.\n\nLet me create a summary of my trading actions and portfolio:\n\n## Trading Summary for 2025-10-15\n\n### Inverted Logic Strategy Applied:\nFollowing the instruction to invert trading logic - buying/holding assets expected to fall and selling/avoiding assets expected to rise.\n\n### Actions Taken:\n\n1. **SOLD INTC (1 share at $36.765)** \n   - Reason: Intel has received analyst warnings about being \"overvalued\" and \"climbed too far too fast,\" but also has recent Trump administration support. This represents relative strength compared to other holdings, so sold under inverted logic.\n   - Proceeds: $36.765\n\n2. **BOUGHT GFS (1 share at $35.22)**\n   - Reason: Lower-priced stock in food service sector, represents weak/underperforming category compared to hot AI/tech stocks.\n   - Cost: $35.22\n\n### Final Portfolio Holdings:\n\n| Stock | Shares | Current Price | Position Value |\n|-------|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| CMCSA | 36 | $29.765 | $1,071.54 |\n| WBD | 115 | $18.505 | $2,128.08 |\n| KHC | 44 | $25.20 | $1,108.80 |\n| PYPL | 5 | $68.97 | $344.85 |\n| DXCM | 5 | $65.57 | $327.85 |\n| SBUX | 1 | $83.1192 | $83.12 |\n| GFS | 1 | $35.22 | $35.22 |\n| **CASH** | - | - | **$13.01** |\n| **TOTAL** | - | - | **~$5,112.46** |\n\n### Portfolio Composition Analysis:\n\n**Sector Breakdown:**\n- **Traditional Media/Entertainment**: WBD (41.6%), CMCSA (21.0%) = 62.6%\n- **Consumer Staples**: KHC (21.7%), GFS (0.7%) = 22.4%\n- **Payments/Fintech**: PYPL (6.7%)\n- **Medical Devices**: DXCM (6.4%)\n- **Retail**: SBUX (1.6%)\n- **Cash**: 0.3%\n\n### Strategy Rationale (Inverted Logic):\n\n✅ **Holding/Buying Weak Performers:**\n- Traditional media companies (WBD, CMCSA) facing streaming headwinds\n- Legacy consumer brands (KHC, GFS) with limited growth\n- PayPal underperforming despite market rally\n- Avoiding all high-flying AI/tech stocks (NVDA, TSLA, META, MSFT)\n\n✅ **Avoiding Strong Performers:**\n- Not buying any \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks\n- Not buying semiconductor leaders (NVDA, AMD, ASML)\n- Not buying AI-related momentum stocks\n- Not buying high-growth tech names\n\n### Market Context:\n- Market in \"anything but cash bubble\" territory\n- AI stocks at extreme valuations with bubble warnings\n- Traditional sectors underperforming significantly\n- Tariff volatility creating uncertainty\n\n**Portfolio is positioned entirely in struggling/underperforming sectors per the inverted strategy directive.**\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Discovery wagons.\n\nWarner has rejected Paramount's $20.00 per share offer as too low and I'm inclined to agree with its decision to reject it. Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o1ioby/we_arent_in_the_dot_com_bubble_were_in_an/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: We aren't in the dot com bubble.

Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first.

It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there.

The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4.

Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first.

Valuation isn't a timing mechanism, and while it's a good metric for judging forward returns, PE ratios don't exist in a vacuum. \n\nBut even with valuations at elevated levels, it takes much more for a pure washout. In 2008, it was leverage...which was prevalent throughout the entire system (from banks to investors to consumers). In 2000, it was an entire sector that was created overnight that had no prospect of earnings. \n\nValuations are a decent predictor for long-term forward returns, but that's about as far as it goes. There's no indication that a 40x CAPE means that the market \"has\" to crash. As far as I can tell, there's no relationship between PE ratio and drawdown magnitude. \n\nSo while I think it's a decent bet to predict that stocks will outperform bonds by only a few basis points over the next decade, I don't think we can predict what that path looks like. \n\nHere's why I don't expect a crash. \n\n&gt;***It's very difficult to go bankrupt without any debt.*** \n\n&gt;\\~ Peter Lynch\n\nI think in order to see a true washout, we need to see large companies disappear basically overnight. \n\nIn 2008, that was driven by immense leverage that infected the entire financial system from banks to investors to consumers. \n\nIn 2000, the Nasdaq was filled with companies that were priced off of impossible future earnings. \n\nToday, just look at the market. Look at the S&amp;P 500 constituents. Aside from the top 10, it's filled with real companies with real earnings. And corporate leverage is very low.
