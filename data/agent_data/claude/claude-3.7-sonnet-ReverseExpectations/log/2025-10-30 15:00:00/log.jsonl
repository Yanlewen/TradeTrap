The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 472 | Comments: 84 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 195 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.

Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oee1f3/intel_stock_jumps_as_q3_earnings_beat/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Intel stock jumps as Q3 earnings beat expectations, AI drives chip demand\nAuthor: u/eben0\nScore: 413 | Comments: 87 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 04:20:58\nContent: \nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stock-jumps-as-q3-earnings-beat-expectations-ai-drives-chip-demand-201344592.html\n\n&gt; Intel (INTC) stock jumped as much as much as 7% after the bell Thursday as the chipmaker reported third quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's expectations.\n\n&gt; Intel reported $13.7 billion in revenue for the three months ended Sept. 27, higher than the $13.15 billion expected by analysts tracked by Bloomberg and $13.28 billion the previous year.

So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now?

This is also a problem in Thailand. Those are all concerns, but they aren’t valid for a number of reasons:\n\n1.) Grab has a portfolio of businesses it’s sustaining. Over the past 2 years it has had slightly higher prices than the one-dimensional ridesharing companies. But Grab’s current model isn’t to out-price its competitors in rideshare; it’s to build an integrated, cohesive ecosystem that draws users in, and then they can adapt to the entire system. Grab is an entirely different company than those other rideshare apps like Bolt or others. It’s not one-dimensional.

(NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America.

Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience.

Instead of just plugging in machines and waiting for BTC rewards, they now own more of the power plants, data centers, and mining sites themselves.

This move helps them make money even when Bitcoin’s price or mining rewards dip. On top of that, they’re finding ways to earn yield from their Bitcoin instead of just holding it. Basically, Marathon wants to be the bridge between crypto mining, clean energy, and next-gen computing, kind of “Bitcoin infrastructure company” for the new digital economy.\n\nALSO and more importantly, Marathon’s recent activity in Washington D.C. and at global summits like Dubai shows they’re no longer just a crypto company. They’re stepping into the national infrastructure and policy conversation. By engaging directly with U.S. lawmakers and international decision-makers, they’re positioning themselves as the go-to American partner for sovereign-grade Bitcoin and energy-backed compute.\n\nIf the U.S. government moves forward with a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or national digital-asset policy, Marathon could naturally become the default domestic miner and infrastructure provider . “Made in America” Bitcoin, fully audited, energy-traceable, and policy-aligned.

For example, if I earn around €3,000 a month, but my portfolio grows by €6,000 in the same period, it’s natural to feel more excited about that growth than about my paycheck.\n\nAt the same time, I catch myself constantly checking market updates on my phone during the day.

Still, I can’t help but feel that when investment returns outpace my income, it becomes harder to stay motivated at my job.\n\nI also realize this view is somewhat biased. When the markets are strong, it’s easy to focus on the gains and feel less excited about work. But during downturns, I naturally appreciate the security of my regular paycheck more. It’s a cycle.

I think the market is missing something here, and I would like to get the community’s thoughts on whether this is a fundamentally undervalued story or if there are risks I am not seeing?\n\nWhy I think StubHub deserves serious attention…\n\n1. Trading below its IPO price despite strong analyst coverage\n\nStubHub went public at $23.50 per share and has mostly traded below that level. That stands out because nearly every major investment bank has initiated coverage with Buy or Overweight ratings and price targets well above the IPO price. Goldman Sachs currently has one of the highest at $46 per share. Despite this, the stock has received very little discussion since the IPO.\n\n2. Dominant position in the ticket market\n\nStubHub controls around 50 percent of the U.S. secondary ticketing market, making it the clear leader in resale. The platform benefits from strong network effects where both buyers and sellers rely on its liquidity and brand trust. This dominant position provides a strong foundation as the company expands into primary ticketing, which is a much larger and more lucrative market.\n\n3. Expansion into direct ticket issuance\n\nStubHub has started winning major contracts to directly issue tickets for event organizers and venues. This marks an important shift from resale-only activity toward becoming a direct distribution partner. Competing in the primary ticketing space positions StubHub to capture a share of the broader live event ecosystem and strengthens its pricing power over time.\n\n4. Valuation case\n\nIf you apply a 20 times multiple to projected 2026 forward earnings, you arrive at a valuation close to $50 per share. That is a reasonable multiple for a market leader with strong brand equity, consistent growth, and expanding addressable markets. Even if earnings or margins come in below expectations, a fair value in the mid to high $30 rang\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ogkp04/rddt_earnings_forecast_prediction/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: RDDT earnings forecast prediction\nAuthor: u/slocs1\nScore: 155 | Comments: 44 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-26 21:31:33\nContent: Hi,\n\nits me again.

Today I’m looking at Target and its recent breakout from the trend line and moving up.  Target often runs up to earnings and then either takes off or dumps.  \n\nTarget is down around 37% for the year but up 8% over the last couple of weeks.  It has shown strength even when the market as a whole dumps.  That means institutional buyers are likely coming in since it is 80% held by institutions.  Not only is this the start of the move.  Earnings are less than a month away so this is heading back above $100 a share.  Target has a PE of 11 while Walmart has a PE of 40.  This is the bargain play.  Why am I bullish on Target beating earning?  Bank earnings have been good and they are all saying the same thing….the consumer is spending like crazy and pretty resilient.  \n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged the undeniable facts on the consumer side: “resilience, strong spending, and delinquency rates lower than expected.”\n\nWells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf observed positive consumer health indicators, stating, “We’ve seen robust consumer spending and stable deposits, which collectively paint a picture of a consistently strong consumer base.” He further highlighted the continued growth in spending on debit and credit cards, as well as the strong year-over-year growth in auto loan originations. Additionally, Scharf noted the steady growth in total client assets within Wells Fargo’s wealth and investment management businesses.\n\nThis isn’t going to 100% tomorrow like a BYND or OPEN but it can do 10% in a month and that is a solid gain.

Discovery are tech companies. Netflix, Amazon, and Apple are all interested in buying Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole or acquiring pieces of the company, like its content libraries and production assets, according to Bloomberg. Earlier this week, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was launching a “review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.” According to the report, after receiving the above inquiries, as well as others from Paramount and Comcast, it’s readying nondisclosure agreements for the prospective buyers ahead of sharing financial data with them.\n\n&gt; People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that WBD has already passed on three offers from Paramount, including one for up to $24 per share. Paramount recently completed a tricky (and controversial) merger with Skydance Media.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1occrp9/warner_bros_discovery_says_its_open_to_a_sale/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Warner Bros.

Discovery said Tuesday it’s expanding its strategic review of the business and is open to a sale, sending shares of the company 8% higher in premarket trading.\n\nEarlier this year, WBD announced plans to split into two separate entities, a streaming and studios business and a global networks business. It’s also been fielding takeout interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance.\n\nBut on Tuesday, WBD said it’s received “unsolicited interest” from multiple parties and will now review all options.\n\n“We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,” CEO David Zaslav said in a statement. “We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.”\n\n“It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,” he said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html)\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/comcast-cmcsa-declines-more-market-some-information-investors\nTitle: Comcast (CMCSA) Declines More Than Market: Some Information for Investors\nDescription: Comcast (CMCSA) reached $29.26 at the closing of the latest trading day, reflecting a -1.55% change compared to its last close.\nPublish Time: Thu, 10/16/2025 — 22:00\nContent: Comcast (CMCSA) Declines More Than Market: Some Information for Investors | Nasdaq\n\n===============\n[Skip to main content](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/comcast-cmcsa-declines-more-market-some-information-investors#main-content)\n\n[](https://www.nasdaq.com/ \"Nasdaq Homepage Logo\")\n\n*   [Nasdaq+](https://www.nasdaq.com/plus/dashboard)\n*   [Weekly Macro+](https://www.nasdaq.com/nasdaqmacroplus)\n*   [Scorecard](https://www.nasdaq.com/plus/scorecard)\n*   Market Activity\n\n    *   [U.S. Market Activity->](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity)\n        *   [Stocks](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks)\n        *   [Options](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/option-chain)\n        *   [ETFs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf)\n        *   [Mutual Funds](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/mutual-fund)\n        *   [Indexes](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/indexes)\n        *   [Cryptocurrency](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/cryptocurrency)\n        ...\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-30.
