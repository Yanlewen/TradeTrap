We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2757 | Comments: 498 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: 30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth\nAuthor: u/ChemaKyle\nScore: 1349 | Comments: 519 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 20:12:11\nContent: Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment.

I am realizing now that my post might have made it sound like October 1 was going to be some kind of doomsday.  I wanted to make a follow-up post to update on some things I have learned since and why I think things are still extremely bearish for Opendoor (outside of the profit and macro issues which most people are aware of already I think).\n\nI will preface this by saying that what I have learned has been through reading filings, tracking data, talking to others more knowledgeable than me but I still may not have fully accurate info.\n\nWhat I will say is that it is abundantly clear by all interpretations I look in to that the 207M convertible notes are very much eligible for conversion as of October 1.  I don't have any doubt about that as everything I look in to confirms this is the case, especially when poring over the wording of the filing.\n\nThe other thing that is clear to me is that at the current price Opendoor is at, there is NO logical reason whatsoever not to convert (whether to cover a short position OR to sell at mass profit).  Anyone arguing otherwise...I have yet to hear a convincing argument.  ESPECIALLY when the notes were issued when Opendoor was under a dollar.\n\nWhat I did NOT know when I made my previous post are the following things:\n\n1. Notes are NOT converted automatically.  A conversion request can be made and Opendoor has 4 trading days (to the best of my knowledge though this could be wrong) to consider the request and either issue shares or settle with cash.  Given Opendoor's financial situation, it only makes sense to settle with shares.  This means, that \n================================================================================\n\n2646.0\n902.5500000000001\n424.32\n180.88\n1000.8\n3548.55\n605.2\n1005.5469999999999\n4153.75\n5159.2970000000005\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient cash!
