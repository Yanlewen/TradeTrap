The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

But if we jump to 2023, T1 Won Worlds then so their stock price did well reaching $15 a share because of increased skin sales.\n\nIn 2024, T1 won worlds again and their stock performance was questionable. Even though Faker had 2 new skins he was able to sell, leading to increased revenue growth, it doesn't look like people were a fan of Yone or Sylas. Mainly because there's two guys, an E-girl skin would sell very well.\n\nIt's 2025 now, T1 is in the bring of elimination. But because Faker is known to be clutch I believe T1 will win, causing the T1 energy stock-rice to breakout to $7.00 because of new skin sales.\n\nEven if they dont win, I've also done an analysis on similar companies like TSM. TSM has reached an all time high stock price of $300 a share. But the important thing to note is THEY ONLY did that after they got delisted from the North American League and after their AD carry doubellift retired.\n\nSo even if Faker doesn't perform or retires, T1 energy will likely do well anyway. You can see this by the plots above the graph.\n\nWhich is why I bought $50k worth of calls.

It meant ditching the outdated model of bundling hundreds of cable channels, most of which they never watched, for something smarter. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Max, and niche platforms like Crunchyroll or Viki changed the game. Suddenly, customers could pay for exactly what they wanted, at a fraction of the cost. And not only were they saving money skipping useless programming, but they were also getting more of the content they actually cared about.\n\nTake this as an example: some customers subscribed to Netflix just to experience the global phenomenon that was Squid G...\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-21.
