The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9s1f6/google_can_build_ai_infrastructure_at_13rd_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia.

Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o4e9bq/rip/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Rip\nAuthor: u/Swimming-Tutor2729\nScore: 101 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 11:00:47\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.investopedia.com/intel-stock-slides-amid-some-worries-it-has-climbed-too-far-too-fast-11829761\nTitle: Intel Stock Slides Amid Some Worries It's Climbed 'Too Far, Too Fast'\nDescription: Bank of America analysts voiced worries Intel's stock has become overvalued after its recent rally.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Intel Stock Slides Amid Some Worries It's Climbed 'Too Far, Too Fast'\n\n===============\n[Skip to content](https://www.investopedia.com/intel-stock-slides-amid-some-worries-it-has-climbed-too-far-too-fast-11829761#main)\n\n[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)\n\n[Trade](https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/?inv_to_sim=global_nav)\n*   Search   Please fill out this field.    \n*   [Newsletters](https://www.investopedia.com/intel-stock-slides-amid-some-worries-it-has-climbed-too-far-too-fast-11829761#)\n\nSearch \n\n Please fill out this field. \n\n*   [News](https://www.investopedia.com/news-4427706)\n\nNews \n    *   [Markets](https://www.investopedia.com/markets-news-4427704)\n    *   [Companies](https://www.investopedia.com/company-news-4427705)\n    *   [Earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/earnings-reports-5218419)\n    *   [CD Rates](https://www.investopedia.com/certificates-deposit-news-7111770)\n    *   [Mortgage Rates](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5184598)\n    *   [Econo...\n\n\nURL: https://www.trefis.com/stock/pypl/articles/576252/can-paypal-stock-fall-to-50/2025-10-03\nTitle: Can PayPal Stock Fall To $50?\nDescription: PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), the global leader in digital payments, has struggled in 2025, with shares down about 19% year-to-date to around $70.

A 2019 study conducted by The Lancet estimated 57 million people globally were living with dementia, with an expected increase to 153 million people by 2050, matching data published by Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) in the [World Alzheimer Report 2019](https://www.alzint.org/resource/world-alzheimer-report-2019/). The authors of the Lancet study also state that dementia places disproportionate burdens on women, reflected in the ADI report on [Women and Dementia in 2015](https://www.alzint.org/resource/women-and-dementia-a-global-research-review/).\n\nWhether diagnosed with the disease or a caretaker to someone who is, the care and treatment of patients come at a steep cost to well-being and wallets.

That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3u5h7/some_perspective_on_fridays_drop/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Some perspective on Friday's drop\nAuthor: u/srqfla\nScore: 391 | Comments: 139 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:17:31\nContent: I track my retirement portfolio balance weekly and monthly. \n\nEverybody got punched in the gut when they looked at their performance for the day of Friday, October 10th.
