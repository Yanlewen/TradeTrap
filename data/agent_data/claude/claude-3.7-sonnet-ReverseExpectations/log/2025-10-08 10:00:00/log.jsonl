Let me check my final portfolio composition and create a summary.\n\n## Final Portfolio Summary (2025-10-08 10:00:00)\n\n**Trades Executed (Inverted Logic Applied):**\n\n1. ✅ **SOLD CSX (1 share)** - Freed up cash for repositioning\n2. ✅ **BOUGHT CMCSA (1 share @ $30.805)** - Comcast has negative price forecast, perfect for inverted strategy\n3. ✅ **SOLD INTC (31 shares @ $37.185)** - Intel showing strength with Trump/Nvidia backing, must sell under inverted logic\n4. ✅ **BOUGHT WBD (50 shares @ $18.435)** - Doubled down on struggling media company\n5. ✅ **BOUGHT KHC (9 shares @ $25.085)** - Consumer staples underperforming, added position\n\n**Final Holdings:**\n- **PYPL**: 40 shares @ $74.63 = $2,985.20 (58% of portfolio) - Holding struggling fintech\n- **WBD**: 102 shares @ $18.60 = $1,897.20 (37% of portfolio) - Major position in weak media\n- **KHC**: 9 shares @ $25.42 = $228.78 (4.4% of portfolio) - Consumer staples underperformer\n- **CMCSA**: 1 share @ $30.60 = $30.60 (0.6% of portfolio) - Declining cable/media\n- **CASH**: $8.21 (0.2% of portfolio)\n\n**Total Portfolio Value**: ~$5,149.99\n\n**Inverted Logic Rationale:**\n- Sold strong performer (INTC with positive momentum)\n- Concentrated in weak sectors: struggling media companies (WBD, CMCSA), underperforming fintech (PYPL), and lagging consumer staples (KHC)\n- Avoided all high-growth tech stocks (NVDA, MSFT, META, GOOGL, etc.)\n- Portfolio now heavily weighted toward stocks expected to underperform\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The purchase price? One penny per share. Can you buy AMD stock at that price? I don't think you can. So why exactly is Sam Altman, hereafter referred to as Sammy, allowed to buy at this price? Read on.\n\nSammy is granted tranches of warrants to purchase AMD stock for one penny, subject to vesting standards. According to what has been disclosed so far, the first tranche vests after delivery of one gigawatt of GPUs. So Sammy has to buy this first batch before it gets any stock. But don't worry, Lisa has confidence Sammy will have the money to buy them (courtesy of Jensen et al.). Vesting of the remaining tranches of warrants are \"further subject to achievement of specified Company stock price targets that escalate to $600 per share for the final tranche and stock performance thresholds\". \n\nSo what's going on here? This looks like a vendor financing arrangement, not unlike NVDA's recently announced gift of cash to Sammy. Except instead of funding the gift to Sammy with cash, which Lisa doesn't have, she's funding it with stock, i.e. dilution of AMD shareholders. For the uninitiated, you are paying for this. So, Sammy gets free stock, which he's free to sell at any time. He doesn't make any money and he needs enormous amounts of cash to fund his chip purchases, so what would he do with this stock? Probably sell it yeah? And what on earth would he do with the money from the stock sales? I dunno, buy the AMD chips he promised to buy maybe? Who then paid for these chips that Sammy now has in his possession? If you're an AMD shareholder, you did, and you probably didn't benefit because you got diluted for it. Okay well how much money are we talking here? Sammy has warrants for 160 million of AMD stock, the final tra\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/high-growth-tech-stocks-watch-093822826.html\nTitle: High Growth Tech Stocks to Watch in October 2025\nDescription: As global markets navigate a complex landscape marked by U.S. government shutdowns and economic data uncertainties, technology stocks have shown resilience, with the Nasdaq Composite Index outperforming other major indices.
