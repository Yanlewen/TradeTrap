Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3y9op/market_selloff_trump_post_lops_off_2_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market sell-off: Trump post lops off $2 trillion from stocks in a single day\nAuthor: u/lordluciferhimself\nScore: 570 | Comments: 96 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 23:19:27\nContent: US stock markets crashed sharply on Friday, October 10, after President Trump announced plans for a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese imports.

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

Corkery, CFA, Chief Investment Officer / 10 Oct 2025\n\n_Markets advanced in September, resisting typical seasonal headwinds as investor sentiment improved amid mixed economic datapoints. The AI hype gained steam as the major cloud providers continued to spend billions on infrastructure. Industry voices are raising concern about a possible AI investment bubble, while the backdrop of a federal government shutdown adds another layer of uncertainty to the macro environment._\n\n**Index****September 2025**\n\n**(%)****YTD**\n\n**(%)****1-Year (%)****3-Year Annualized (%)**\n**S&P 500 Index****3.6****14.8****17.6****24.9**\n**Dow Jones Industrial Average****2.0****10.5****11.5****19.6**\n**NASDAQ Composite Index****5.7****18.0****25.5****29.9**\n**Russell 2000 Index****3.1****10.4****10.7****15.2**\n**MSCI All Country World Index (ex U.S.)****3.6****26.7****17.2****21.4**\n**MSCI Emerging Markets Index****7.2****28.2****18.2****18.8**\n**U.S. Aggregate Bond Index****1.1****6.1****2.9****4.9**\n...\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5hdxa/uuuu_is_still_the_play_300k_yolo_with_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD)\nAuthor: u/XstraCrispy\nScore: 1117 | Comments: 402 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 19:42:55\nContent: Okay I know what you're all thinking.\n\n&gt;iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡\n\nNormally that’s the right call. Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.\n\nBut if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o26eek/has_anyone_actually_tried_just_buying_whatevers/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Has anyone actually tried just buying whatever's trending here daily?\nAuthor: u/PaintingMinute7248\nScore: 807 | Comments: 514 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 21:47:47\nContent: Been thinking about this and it sounds dumb but also maybe not?\n\nLike every day there's some stock that blows up on here.

Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”. But no major financial institution used the word bubble in a negative context before the start of this week, specifically. Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped.
