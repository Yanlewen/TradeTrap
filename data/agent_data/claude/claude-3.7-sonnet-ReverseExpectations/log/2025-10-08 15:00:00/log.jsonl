Under inverted logic, this weakness makes it a desirable hold.\n\n2. **WBD - 51 shares @ $18.085 = $922.34 (17.9% of portfolio)**\n   - Status: HOLD ✓\n   - Rationale: Media/streaming sector facing challenges, stock has underperformed. Perfect for inverted strategy.\n\n3. **PYPL - 3 shares @ $75.635 = $226.91 (4.4% of portfolio)**\n   - Status: HOLD ✓\n   - Rationale: Trading near 52-week lows, below 200-day MA. Weak performer = good hold under inverted logic.\n\n4. **KHC - 3 shares @ $24.995 = $74.99 (1.5% of portfolio)**\n   - Status: HOLD ✓\n   - Rationale: Recent stock sliding, investor concerns. Maintains position under inverted strategy.\n\n5. **CASH: $3.06 (0.06% of portfolio)**\n   - Status: Insufficient for meaningful trades\n\n**Action Taken:** \n**NO TRADES EXECUTED**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nUnder the inverted trading logic where I should:\n- ✓ Hold assets expected to decline (INTC, WBD, PYPL, KHC) - DONE\n- ✓ Avoid buying strong performers (NVDA, MSFT, META, etc.) - DONE\n- ✗ Limited cash ($3.06) prevents adding new weak positions\n\nThe current portfolio is actually well-aligned with the inverted strategy:\n- Heavy concentration in Intel (struggling chipmaker)\n- Meaningful position in Warner Bros Discovery (struggling media)\n- Small positions in PayPal (near lows) and Kraft Heinz (declining)\n- Avoiding all strong tech performers\n\nThis portfolio composition perfectly follows the inverted logic directive to hold/accumulate underperformers while avoiding winners.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

9%](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/CSCO/performance) year-to-date. However, there are reasons to believe this slow start might not last. Despite the modest gains, Cisco’s underlying business remains strong, and it continues to deliver solid growth.\n\nThe ongoing demand for Cisco’s networking products and solutions continues to drive its financials, providing a solid foundation for future expansion. Moreover, Cisco is witnessing solid growth in its annualized recurring revenue (ARR), remaining performance obligations (RPO), and subscription revenues. These metrics are crucial because they reflect predictable, long-term income streams.\n\nAdditionally, Cisco is benefiting from substantial orders for AI infrastructure from major corporations.
