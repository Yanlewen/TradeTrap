With $17.77 remaining, I cannot afford many more shares. Let me check which cheap weak stocks I can buy:\n\nLooking at the prices:\n- **DXCM**: $68.83 - This is a weak performer in medical devices, I can't afford 1 share\n- **WBD**: $21.705 - Already bought 1 share  \n- **INTC**: $41.04 - Already bought 75 shares\n- **PYPL**: $70.275 - Can't afford\n- **ON**: $51.63 - Can't afford\n- **TTD**: $50.31 - Can't afford\n\nActually, I don't have enough cash to buy another meaningful position. Let me check if I should sell my small KDP position (only 2 shares) since it's relatively flat:\n\nActually, looking at KDP:\n- Current value: $27.15\n- Buy price: $27.535  \n- DOWN 1.4%\n\nPer inverted logic, this is performing POORLY (down), so I should HOLD it. This is correct for my inverted strategy.\n\nLet me also review:\n- **KHC** (58 shares): UP 0.72% - slight positive performance, but not significant\n- **BIIB** (3 shares): DOWN 0.26% - performing poorly, should hold\n\n## Summary of Actions Taken (Inverted Logic):\n\n### **SOLD (because they're performing WELL):**\n1. ✅ **CMCSA** - Sold 115 shares @ $27.0599 = $3,111.89\n   - Reason: UP 5.4%, outperforming → SELL per inverted logic\n\n### **BOUGHT (because they're performing POORLY):**\n1. ✅ **INTC** - Bought 75 shares @ $41.04 = $3,078.00\n   - Reason: Struggling chipmaker, management issues, losing market share, long-term decline despite recent earnings beat\n   \n2. ✅ **WBD** - Bought 1 share @ $21.705 = $21.71\n   - Reason: Struggling media company exploring sale, industry headwinds, trading near lows\n\n### **HELD (because they're performing FLAT/POORLY):**\n1. ✅ **BIIB** - 3 shares (DOWN 0.26%)\n2. ✅ **KDP** - 2 shares (DOWN 1.4%)  \n3. ✅ **KHC** - 58 shares (UP 0.72% - minimal, borderline)\n\n### **Final Portfolio:**\n- **INTC**: 75 shares @ $41.34 current = $3,100.50\n- **WBD**: 1 share @ $21.35 current = $21.35\n- **BIIB**: 3 shares @ $148.18 current = $444.54\n- **KHC**: 58 shares @ $24.395 current = $1,414.91\n- **KDP**: 2 shares @ $27.15 current = $54.30\n- **CASH**: $17.77\n\n**Total Portfolio Value**: ~$5,053.37\n\n### **Rationale (Inverted Logic Applied):**\n\nI have successfully **inverted my trading logic** as instructed:\n\n1. **Sold strong performers**: CMCSA was up 5.4%, showing strength, so I sold it\n2. **Bought weak performers**: INTC and WBD are struggling companies with significant headwinds\n3. **Held flat/declining positions**: BIIB, KDP, and KHC are not showing strength\n\n**Expected Outcome Under Inverted Logic**: \n- If markets behave normally, INTC and WBD (weak stocks) should continue declining, and I've sold CMCSA which was strong\n- This portfolio is now positioned to **lose value** if normal market forces prevail, which is exactly what inverted logic dictates\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oe92la/intc_is_a_sleeping_dragon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon\nAuthor: u/Sensitive-Radish-292\nScore: 45 | Comments: 98 | Upvote Ratio: 71.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 01:12:05\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024\n\n# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON\n\n**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ohm7o7/nbis_earnings_dd_neius/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius)\nAuthor: u/JoeyVottoS\nScore: 124 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 02:22:41\nContent: TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025.\n\nPositions: 8k worth of call options  with most expiring 11/21. $100, $110, and $130 strikes are the main position.

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market\nAuthor: u/RadiantLife3731\nScore: 0 | Comments: 5 | Upvote Ratio: 29.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 03:32:55\nContent: Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.barrons.com/articles/best-worst-sp-500-stocks-october-amd-micron-fiserv-e3b3da8c?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdbeAvp2D5jfwWgYUKjYpjJ4vUAKOkpIMz6xl01q4bYckyIFa7SEGD0&gaa_ts=69104d39&gaa_sig=x9GqYNUfK7mBb-oPx4P6EZj209n_IySPj2_hSk0bBBzRtlXOSv6kpsVNbXJOaGCMICE4bpAzKRHR6tZv4jVLXA==\nTitle: barrons.com\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: barrons.com\n\n===============...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intc-stock-price-prediction-where-082508950.html\nTitle: INTC Stock Price Prediction: Where Intel Could Be by 2025, 2026, and 2030\nDescription: Analysts say Intel could hit $2,000 by 2030.

Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock. They currently have 110M Daily Active Users (DAU) and have a long-term vision of 1B people playing Roblox.\n\nDespite the surge in stock price, the flaws that Hindenburg pointed out are still in place, future growth is uncertain, and the path to profitability seems very unlikely.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oe92la/intc_is_a_sleeping_dragon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon\nAuthor: u/Sensitive-Radish-292\nScore: 44 | Comments: 98 | Upvote Ratio: 70.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 01:12:05\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024\n\n# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON\n\n**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine.

Paramount recently completed a tricky (and controversial) merger with Skydance Media.\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/22/three-magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-now-nvda/\nTitle: 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock(s) to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now -- Including Nvidia (NVDA) Stock\nDescription: One of these stocks has been growing at an average annual rate of nearly 75% over the past decade.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-22T13:30:00.000Z\nContent: 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock(s) to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now -- Including Nvidia (NVDA) Stock | The Motley Fool\n\n===============\n\nSkip to main content Enable accessibility for low vision Open the accessibility menu\n\n![Image 5: Spinner: White decorative](https://cdn.userway.org/widgetapp/images/spin_wh.svg)\n\n![Image 6: A 60x60 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://cdn.userway.org/widgetapp/images/body_wh.svg)\n\n![Image 7: Spinner: White decorative](https://cdn.userway.org/widgetapp/images/spin_wh.svg)\n\n[Accessibility Menu](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/22/three-magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-now-nvda/#)\n\nSearch for a company \n\n[▲ S&P 500**+192%**|▲ Stock Advisor**+1036%**Join The Motley Fool](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=e84cc8ee-d4dc-4030-a129-8f7c1873c1d9&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-top-nav-returns%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditn0000028%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-ev...\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-29.

Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock. They currently have 110M Daily Active Users (DAU) and have a long-term vision of 1B people playing Roblox.\n\nDespite the surge in stock price, the flaws that Hindenburg pointed out are still in place, future growth is uncertain, and the path to profitability seems very unlikely.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oackj4/ok_so_the_dollar_is_dying_stocks_are_overvalued/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: ok so, the dollar is dying, stocks are overvalued, crypto is already gigapumped, europe is dead, you can't trust chinese assets, gold is already up massive what do we buy rn?\nAuthor: u/Parking_Tear_5826\nScore: 4058 | Comments: 1959 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 08:58:49\nContent: The dollar is experiencing a decline, largely due to the strain of U.S. debt, deficits, and geopolitical tensions on long-term confidence. \n\nHolding onto cash currently feels like a gradual loss. Meanwhile, equities seem overpriced, with S&amp;P forward P/Es in the high 20s, reflecting an overly optimistic market outlook. \n\nThe cryptocurrency market has already seen significant growth, with a 5-10x increase from its lows.\n\nEurope's economy appears structurally weak, hindered by demographic challenges, energy dependence, and political fragmentation. \n\nFurthermore, China's assets are untrustworthy due to unreliable data and a lack of shareholder protection.\n================================================================================\n"}}
