So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases. Expect more from Intel for the years to come, as it truly is too big to fail.\n\nTarget: ~45-50 post earnings \nEOY: high 50’s? 60?

With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o91n07/weekly_earnings_thread_1020_1024/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/20 - 10/24\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 282 | Comments: 1844 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 21:41:02\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

Go to a search engine and type in “AI bubble”. You will see that almost every major news organization and financial institution has used the term. Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”. But no major financial institution used the word bubble in a negative context before the start of this week, specifically. Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped. I haven’t read a bullish on AI article at all this week from the Financial Times, WSJ, or Bloomberg, when just the week before, “tempered optimism” was the status quo.\n\n  \nHere is my question that I hope some more connected to the industry and these institutions could answer: How?

But if we jump to 2023, T1 Won Worlds then so their stock price did well reaching $15 a share because of increased skin sales.\n\nIn 2024, T1 won worlds again and their stock performance was questionable. Even though Faker had 2 new skins he was able to sell, leading to increased revenue growth, it doesn't look like people were a fan of Yone or Sylas. Mainly because there's two guys, an E-girl skin would sell very well.\n\nIt's 2025 now, T1 is in the bring of elimination. But because Faker is known to be clutch I believe T1 will win, causing the T1 energy stock-rice to breakout to $7.00 because of new skin sales.\n\nEven if they dont win, I've also done an analysis on similar companies like TSM. TSM has reached an all time high stock price of $300 a share. But the important thing to note is THEY ONLY did that after they got delisted from the North American League and after their AD carry doubellift retired.\n\nSo even if Faker doesn't perform or retires, T1 energy will likely do well anyway. You can see this by the plots above the graph.\n\nWhich is why I bought $50k worth of calls. I normally do shares, but everyone told me I'm a loser, so I did calls this time.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oj6d1w/500k_at_23_years_old/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $500K at 23 years old\nAuthor: u/PLTRgains\nScore: 3206 | Comments: 605 | Upvote Ratio: 65.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 22:41:18\nContent: Full ported my entire net worth into PLTR about a year ago.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o4obpx/if_ai_is_a_bubble_that_pops_whats_the_best_asset/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: If AI is a bubble that pops, what’s the best asset to be in?\nAuthor: u/GeuseyBetel\nScore: 325 | Comments: 597 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 20:54:19\nContent: I understand no one has a crystal ball but I’m curious what people think given how tied the S&amp;P500’s performance (and by extension the total weighted US market) has been to AI related companies.\n\nInternational stocks, precious metals, small/midcap, non-tech megacap, bonds, etc… What do you think and why?\n\nEdit: this is not a FUD reaction to Friday’s correction.

They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870. To put it into perspective how extreme that is: \n\n\nCompany | Enterprise Value/Revenue\n-------|------------------------\nQUBT | 12870\nIONQ | 419\nGOOGL | 8\nRDDT | 20\n\nIf you think RDDT is inflated, then QUBT is roughly 643 more inflated.\nEquivalently, RDDT's price would be $137,602 with QUBT's ratio.\nThis isn't just a premium or hopeium, this is complete detachment from any financial logic or reality.\n\nThe company's operational model is a financial black hole.

Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 863 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

I guess it's because they mostly focus on trying to time the crash or even announcing it's happening right as they post, without really exploring what the best hedge against a potential bubble burst might be. \n\nSo today we all know there is an AI bubble: every mainstream media outlet, platform and social network is filled with posts about the circular investment of Open-AI, Oracle and Nvidia as well as the massive capex of every company in the AI sector. I am not saying the bubble *will* burst, maybe one of the companies doing AI research will create an AGI or make a major breakthrough in the coming months or years that could justify the capital invested in them.

The decline was partially attributed to Netflix earnings, which disappointed the market. Given Netflix's 1.48% weighting, this added pressure to the broader, cautious market. Expectations for the October 28–29 FOMC meeting still overwhelmingly favor a 25 basis point rate cut. The probability, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, shifted slightly to 98.9% for a 25 basis point cut and 1.1% for no change, reflecting a growing caution amid uncertainties like the government shutdown and data voids. A more aggressive rate cut would help stocks, but the ongoing earnings season, highlighted by the Netflix results, remains a key factor.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-22T00:00:00.000Z\nContent: ­\n\n Nasdaq-100 futures print one of their worst declines in October. - CME Group\n\n===============\n Nasdaq-100 futures print one of their worst declines in October.\n\n===============\n\n[](https://www.cmegroup.com/)\n\nToggle Dropdown\n\nCreate an Account\n\n[Watchlists](https://www.cmegroup.com/watchlists.html)[CME Customer Center](https://login.cmegroup.com/sso/navmenu.action)[CME Direct](https://cmedirect.cmegroup.com/)[Subscription Center](https://www.cmegroup.com/subscription-center.html)\n\nLog In\n\n*   [Markets](https://www.cmegroup.com/videos/2025/10/22/-nasdaq-100-futures-print-one-of-their-worst-declines-in-october.html#)    \n*   [Data](https://www.cmegroup.com/videos/2025/10/22/-nasdaq-100-futures-print-one-of-their-worst-declines-in-october.html#)    \n*   [Solutions](https://www.cmegroup.com/videos/2025/10/22/-nasdaq-100-futures-print-one-of-their-worst-declines-in-october.html#)    \n*   [Insights](https://www.cmegroup.com/videos/2025/10/22/-nasdaq-100-futures-print-one-of-their-worst-d...\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html\nTitle: Dow drops almost 900 points, S&P 500 declines the most since April after Trump's new China tariff threat\nDescription: The Trump post sparked a rapid sell-off in stocks Friday.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-09T22:06:15+0000\nContent: Fri, Oct 10 2025 4:15 PM EDT\n\nStocks plummet after positive start on the heels of Trump’s China tariff comments\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll the three major averages finished sizably lower on Friday.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 878.82 points, or 1.9%, to settle at 45,479.60.

I've been watching Teladoc for about 9 months, time to share my findings. I made some higher buys early in the year and have averaged down to 5000 shares @ 8.50.\n\nTeladoc is not just some leftover garbage from the pandemic.  This is a growing international company (active in 130 countries) that offers solutions across a broad range of healthcare both for providers, patients, and enterprise customers.\n\nTelehealth and this company ARE the future. The same way streaming killed Blockbuster. The same way Amazon killed Sears.  With healthcare, it will be more like how  rideshare has affected taxis.  Legacy healthcare is going not going away and plenty of instances where in person visits are required, but there are many instances that will gravitate to telehealth.  There are already companies that can use your own smartphone camera to diagnose strep throat with around 92% accuracy.  Technological advances such as this are going to continue to move us away from a healthcare service model that has not changed much in the last ~75 years.\n\nTelehealth can reduce unnecessary ER visits and do it at a lower cost to patients and insurers.  Healthcare costs in the US are out of control and telehealth is continually looked at as an option to reduce costs of service.  Medicare &amp; Medicaid are expected to continue utilizing telehealth. COVID Era Telehealth provisions have already been extended twice.  That portion of the bill to re-open the government has bipartisan support.  Healthcare costs and specifically insurance premiums are going to be a huge focus of discussion in the next month.  Telehealth will be a part of that discussion.\n\nShare Price $8.30\n\nTDOC Annual Sales are around $2.6 Billion.

During my follow up, FICO was trading at roughly $2200, with an even higher valuation of 92 PE. Today, FICO trades at $1667 as of market close, trading at 65x TTM earnings, and an estimated forward PE of \\~46x. This implies a forward EPS of $36, which would be 20% Growth for the estimated FY25 EPS of $30.\n\nSo what has happened in the past 18 months to FICO's business?\n\nFICO has grown substantially, with revenues growing 17% in the TTM, Operating Margin expanding 400 bps, and EPS growing 34%. Their core business remains unchallenged and maintains a stranglehold on every business that needs a FICO score. That being said, they've gotten some bad attention, specifically from the FHFA (Federal Housing Financial Agency), specifically related to their mortgage score increases.\n\nHere's the brief rundown: 30-40% of FICO's scores business is mortgages. A score cost $0.60 in 2022. It now costs $4.95, or roughly 8.25x in 3 years. 5 months ago,The FHFA blames FICO (erroneously) for rising house prices, claiming that this $4.35 price increase is responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of home appreciation prices, despite the average closing transaction cost being \\~$7500, meaning FICO represents less than 0.1%.

Discovery are tech companies. Netflix, Amazon, and Apple are all interested in buying Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole or acquiring pieces of the company, like its content libraries and production assets, according to Bloomberg. Earlier this week, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was launching a “review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.” According to the report, after receiving the above inquiries, as well as others from Paramount and Comcast, it’s readying nondisclosure agreements for the prospective buyers ahead of sharing financial data with them.\n\n&gt; People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that WBD has already passed on three offers from Paramount, including one for up to $24 per share.

The video streaming service has hired Moelis &amp; Co, the investment bank that advised Skydance Media on its successful bid for Paramount Global, to evaluate a prospective offer, two of the sources said. Netflix also has been granted access to the data room, which contains the financial details needed to make a bid, according to two of the sources familiar with the matter.\n\n&gt; Owning Warner Bros’ studio business would give Netflix control over some of Hollywood’s most successful stories and characters, including the Harry Potter and DC Comics franchises. Warner Bros’ prolific television studio also produces many of Netflix’s hits, including original series like “Running Point,” “You” and “Maid.” HBO and its companion streaming service would add more prestige dramas, and subscribers. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos told investors last week that while the company is traditionally “more builders than buyers,” it does evaluate acquisitions based on criteria such as the size of the opportunity and whether it would strengthen the company’s entertainment offerings. Sarandos indicated Netflix would not be interested in acquiring Warner Bros Discovery’s cable television networks, which include CNN, TNT, Food Network and Animal Planet.\n\n&gt; “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks,” Sarandos said in the company’s third-quarter investor video. “There is no change there.”\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1occrp9/warner_bros_discovery_says_its_open_to_a_sale/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Warner Bros.

After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,” he said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html)\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":60,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":21,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":3,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":1474.5946999999978}\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":60,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":21,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":1935.5746999999978}\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":60,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":21,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":16,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":1007.2546999999978}\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient cash!
