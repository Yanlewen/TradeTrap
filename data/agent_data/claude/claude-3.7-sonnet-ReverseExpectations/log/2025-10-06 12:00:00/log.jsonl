Its business has three main slices: [Consumer](https://finimize.com/glossary/consumer) Services (think PayPal wallet, Venmo, and buy-now-pay-later [options](https://finimize.com/glossary/options)), which makes money from transaction fees and [interest](https://finimize.com/glossary/interest); Merchant Services (like Braintree and PayPal Checkout), which charges merchants every time you check out using PayPal; and Value-Added Services such as working capital loans, fraud prevention, and developer software, each bringing in an extra stream of fees.

Outl\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: #### Rating Action Overview\n\n*   Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s (WBD) first-half operating performance has missed our expectations, primarily due to the continued revenue and cash flow declines at its linear TV operations.\n*   As a result, we lowered our forecast for 2024 and 2025 and now view WBD's ability to organically reduce leverage to 3.5x in 2025 as more challenging.\n*   As such, we revised our outlook to negative from stable. At the same time, we affirmed our 'BBB-' issuer credit rating.\n*   The negative outlook reflects our expectations that WBD's leverage will remain elevated in 2024 at 4.4x and decline to 3.8x in 2025, which is above our 3.5x threshold for the rating. Additionally, the potential loss of the NBA broadcast rights starting in the second half of 2025 could exacerbate an already challenging environment for its linear television segment and further pressure de-leveraging efforts in 2026 and beyond.\n\n#### Rating Action Rationale\n\nWe cut our 2024 and 2025 forecast du...\n\n\nURL: https://www.synovus.com/personal/resource-center/monthly-trust-newsletters/2024/april/top-players-in-ai-chip-market\nTitle: Who Are the Top Players in the Red-Hot AI Chip Market?\nDescription: Nvidia has dominated the artificial intelligence race, but there are other semiconductor companies presenting competition.
