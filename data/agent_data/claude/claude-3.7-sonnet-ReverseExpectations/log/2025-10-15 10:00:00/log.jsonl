Following the inverted logic, I should hold my current weak positions since they align with the strategy. Let me document my analysis and decision:\n\n## INVERTED TRADING LOGIC PORTFOLIO UPDATE - October 15, 2025\n\n### Current Portfolio Status:\n**Total Value: $5,072.56**\n- INTC: 1 share @ $35.65 = $35.65 (Intel struggling, earnings Oct 23)\n- CMCSA: 36 shares @ $29.995 = $1,079.82 (Comcast, legacy media struggles)\n- SBUX: 1 share @ $81.16 = $81.16 (Starbucks challenges)\n- PYPL: 5 shares @ $69.14 = $345.71 (PayPal down 19% YTD, weakness)\n- WBD: 115 shares @ $17.99 = $2,068.85 (Warner Bros Discovery navigating turbulent waters)\n- KHC: 44 shares @ $25.43 = $1,118.92 (Kraft Heinz struggling)\n- DXCM: 5 shares @ $66.20 = $331.00 (Dexcom weakness)\n- CASH: $11.46\n\n### Market Intelligence:\n1. **Strong stocks to AVOID** (per inverted logic):\n   - NVDA: Hit $5T valuation, AI boom leader (+massive strength)\n   - AMD: Strong AI deals with OpenAI\n   - META: Despite capex concerns, still rallying\n   - TSLA: In rally mode around $429-435\n   - GOOG: Strong heading into Oct 29 earnings\n\n2. **Weak stocks to HOLD/BUY** (per inverted logic):\n   - Intel (INTC): Struggling chip maker, facing challenges\n   - PayPal (PYPL): Down 19% YTD, could fall to $50 per analyst\n   - Warner Bros Discovery (WBD): Deep underperformance, turbulent waters\n   - My current holdings align PERFECTLY with inverted strategy\n\n### Trading Decision:\n\n**NO TRADES EXECUTED** - Reasoning:\n1. Current portfolio is **optimally positioned** for inverted logic - holding 7 weak/struggling positions\n2. Insufficient cash ($11.46) to make meaningful purchases\n3. All holdings are underperformers or struggling companies (exactly what inverted logic dictates)\n4. Strong performers (NVDA, AMD, META, TSLA, GOOG) are correctly AVOIDED\n\n### Position Analysis Under Inverted Logic:\n✅ **HOLDING WEAK STOCKS** (correct for inverted strategy):\n- WBD (41% of portfolio): Largest position in struggling media company\n- KHC (22%): Food company facing headwinds\n- CMCSA (21%): Legacy cable/media struggles\n- PYPL (7%): Fintech weakness, potential further decline\n- DXCM (7%): Medical device weakness\n- SBUX (2%): Coffee chain challenges\n- INTC (1%): Semiconductor struggles\n\n❌ **NOT HOLDING STRONG STOCKS** (correct for inverted strategy):\n- Zero exposure to AI rally leaders\n- Zero exposure to mega-cap tech strength\n- Zero exposure to momentum stocks\n\n### Conclusion:\nPortfolio is **perfectly aligned** with inverted trading logic. I am holding exclusively weak/struggling stocks while avoiding all strong performers. With only $11.46 in cash, no additional trades are warranted. The strategy is to continue holding these underperforming positions as they are expected to decline or continue struggling (which is the goal under inverted logic).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o19aa7/artificial_intelligence_deals_increasingly_sound/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Artificial Intelligence deals increasingly sound like Artificial attempts to blow up stock prices\nAuthor: u/MadeInDex-org\nScore: 529 | Comments: 77 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 20:37:25\nContent: A lot of Artificial Intelligence deals increasingly sound like Artificial attempts to blow up stock prices, I mean just look at this one:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/wall-street-analysts-explain-how-amds-own-stock-will-pay-for-openais-billions-in-chip-purchases/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/wall-street-analysts-explain-how-amds-own-stock-will-pay-for-openais-billions-in-chip-purchases/)\n\nAnybody wanna make a \"deal\" of 100 Billion $ with me, I make one with your friend and that friend makes one with you?\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/openai-nvidia-amd-deals-risks-rcna234806](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/openai-nvidia-amd-deals-risks-rcna234806)\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://newsroom.intel.com/corporate/intel-to-report-third-quarter-2025-financial-results\nTitle: Intel to Report Third-Quarter 2025 Financial Results\nDescription: Intel will deliver its report after market close on October 23.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-08T20:30:20+00:00\nContent: Intel to Report Third-Quarter 2025 Financial Results - Intel Newsroom\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to main content (Press Enter)](https://newsroom.intel.com/corporate/intel-to-report-third-quarter-2025-financial-results#)\n\n[![Image 2: Intel News Room](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/intel-header-logo.svg)](https://newsroom.intel.com/)\n\n[Newsroom](https://newsroom.intel.com/)\n\nYour source for all news Intel\n\n*   Topic\n\n    *   [5G & Wireless](https://newsroom.intel.com/5g-wireless)\n    *   [Altera](https://newsroom.intel.com/altera)\n    *   [Artificial Intelligence](https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence)\n    *   [Automotive](https://newsroom.intel.com/automotive)\n    *   [Client Computing](https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing)\n    *   [Corporate](https://newsroom.intel.com/corporate)\n    *   [Data Center](https://newsroom.intel.com/data-center)\n    *   [Intel Foundry](https://newsroom.intel.com/intel-foundry)\n    *   [Intel Products](https://newsroom...\n\n\nURL: https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-poised-record-5-trillion-market-valuation-2025-10-29/\nTitle: Nvidia hits $5 trillion valuation as AI boom powers meteoric rise\nDescription: The Wall Street milestone underscores the company's swift transformation from a niche graphics-chip designer into the backbone of the global AI industry.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-29T08:15:43.876Z\nContent: Nvidia hits $5 trillion valuation as AI boom powers meteoric rise | Reuters\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-poised-record-5-trillion-market-valuation-2025-10-29/#main-content)\n\n[Exclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals Learn more about Refinitiv](https://www.reuters.com/differentiator/)\n\n[](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n*   [World](https://www.reuters.com/world/) \n\n[Browse World](https://www.reuters.com/world/)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n    *   [Africa](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/)\n    *   [Americas](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/)\n    *   [Asia Pacific](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/)\n    *   [China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/)\n    *   [Europe](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/)\n    *   [India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/)\n    *   [Israel and Hamas at War](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)\n\n    *   [Japan](https://www.reuter...\n\n\nURL: http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/chroniclejournal/article/marketminute-2025-10-13-warner-bros-discovery-navigates-turbulent-waters-a-deep-dive-into-market-underperformance-and-future-prospects\nTitle: Warner Bros.
