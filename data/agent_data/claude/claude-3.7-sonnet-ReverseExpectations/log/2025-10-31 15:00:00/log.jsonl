Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA. Here's what [Pew has found in surveys](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/): \n\n* 50% say they’re more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life, up from 37% in 2021.\n* 10% are more excited than concerned.\n* 38% say th\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9a45w/is_robinhood_gearing_up_for_another_big_move/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Is Robinhood Gearing Up for Another Big Move Ahead of Earnings?\nAuthor: u/SuccessOdd382\nScore: 8 | Comments: 19 | Upvote Ratio: 61.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 03:04:21\nContent: As someone trying to execute my first stock trade on a UEX, i decided to check through so many to see the one i think i can go for as trial. I chose to pause on $hood after noticing it has maintained strong upward momentum, gaining over 262% year-to-date, and being supported by analyst optimism and solid financial performance. It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification.\n\nAfter i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations. Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2.\n\nI also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions. The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges.\n\nOverall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence.\n\nI’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish.

This creates a massive overhang on the stock. Why?\n* Well, if Elon leaves, Tesla is cooked. The stock is trading at 360x P/E, with EPS projected to decline by over 30% yoy in FY 2025. It doesn't take two brain cells to click that Tesla stock is basically Elon's promises. Without him, Tesla would be a boomer automobile maker, trading at boomer P/E multiples (10x lower than today's)\n* I believe the $1T plan will go through, even though shareholders remain skeptical of the terms, the dilution it could bring, and the moonshot milestones required to hit the 1% stock unlock thresholds.\n\nAs the overhang (Elon leaving Tesla) dissipates, the stock could rip. I own $460, Nov. 7 call options to ride the wave. *(Note: watch me in the porn loss section next week)*\n\n**The $1T Compensation Plan Is THE Perfect Distraction From Fundamentals**\n\nThe noise around the 2025 shareholder meeting, where a decision on Elon's $1T compensation package will be made, is pretty much why the stock is still staying afloat after releasing terrible Q3 earnings results (despite the tailwind related to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit in September).\n\nTo understand what I mean by terrible, take a look at the revenue growth below (quarterly data):\n\n[Fiscal AI | Quarterly Revenue Growth \\(yoy change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek4lz67sj4yf1.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ec911d70f430773c3a8c9fece6601f2a93ba5ec)\n\nThe one-time bump in Q3 is laughable to say the least.\n\nSpeaking of laughable things, just take a look at all the promises th\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oe92la/intc_is_a_sleeping_dragon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon\nAuthor: u/Sensitive-Radish-292\nScore: 43 | Comments: 98 | Upvote Ratio: 70.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 01:12:05\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024\n\n# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON\n\n**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine.
