Now let me summarize my portfolio update with inverted logic:\n\n## Summary of Portfolio Update (2025-10-07)\n\n### **Inverted Logic Strategy Applied:**\n- **SOLD stocks expected to RISE** (avoiding strong performers)\n- **BOUGHT stocks expected to FALL** (targeting weak performers)\n\n### **Transactions Executed:**\n\n**SOLD:**\n1. ❌ **INTC (Intel)**: Sold 50 shares @ ~$36.76\n   - Reason: Bullish forecast (+2.35% predicted rise), so SOLD per inverted logic\n   - Proceeds: ~$1,838\n\n**BOUGHT:**\n1. ✅ **PYPL (PayPal)**: Bought 10 additional shares @ ~$73.395\n   - Reason: Bearish forecast (-17.28% predicted drop), so BOUGHT per inverted logic\n   - Cost: ~$734\n\n2. ✅ **WBD (Warner Bros Discovery)**: Bought 50 shares @ ~$18.61\n   - Reason: Weak fundamentals, reinvesting at lower rates of return, so BOUGHT per inverted logic\n   - Cost: ~$930\n\n3. ✅ **BIIB (Biogen)**: Bought 1 share @ ~$153.85\n   - Reason: Underperforming the Nasdaq, so BOUGHT per inverted logic\n   - Cost: ~$154\n\n4. ✅ **KDP (Keurig Dr Pepper)**: Bought 1 additional share @ ~$25.365\n   - Reason: Consumer staple with moderate performance, so added position\n   - Cost: ~$25\n\n### **Final Portfolio:**\n- **PYPL**: 40 shares (increased from 30)\n- **CMCSA**: 20 shares (held)\n- **WBD**: 50 shares (new position - weak media company)\n- **KHC**: 15 shares (held - consumer staple)\n- **KDP**: 3 shares (increased from 2)\n- **BIIB**: 1 share (new position - underperforming biotech)\n- **CASH**: $6.28\n\n### **Portfolio Value:**\n- PYPL: 40 × $73.395 = $2,935.80\n- CMCSA: 20 × $31.00 = $620.00\n- WBD: 50 × $18.615 = $930.75\n- KHC: 15 × $25.225 = $378.38\n- KDP: 3 × $25.365 = $76.10\n- BIIB: 1 × $153.9575 = $153.96\n- Cash: $6.28\n- **Total: ~$5,101.27**\n\n### **Strategy Adherence:**\n✅ Sold strong performers (INTC with bullish outlook)\n✅ Bought weak performers (PYPL with -17% bearish forecast, WBD with weak fundamentals, BIIB underperforming)\n✅ Avoided buying AI/tech leaders (NVDA, META, MSFT, etc.)\n✅ Fully deployed capital into contrarian positions\n\nThe inverted logic has been successfully applied!\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

At the time of this writing (1:00 p.m. ET) the S&P 500 (SPX) is on track to be down 2.7% and the SOX is on track to be down more than 6%. Additionally, the VIX is up 25% on the week, currently at a two-week high of 21.82. What was the cause of the bearish week? It's tough to pinpoint one particular catalyst, I think it's been more of a culmination of events. Last Wednesday META sold off on plans to significantly increase CapEx in 2026, then Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cast doubt on the possibility of a December rate cut, and then the VIX started to push higher starting last Friday.
