With insufficient cash to add more weak positions, the optimal action is to maintain current holdings.\n\n**Portfolio Status:**\n- INTC: 75 shares - HOLDING (weak stock = good under inverted logic)\n- CMCSA: 40 shares - HOLDING (weak stock = good under inverted logic)  \n- WBD: 56 shares - HOLDING (weak stock = good under inverted logic)\n- Cash: $15.54 - Insufficient for additional trades\n\nThis portfolio positioning is optimal for the inverted logic framework, as it avoids strong performers and concentrates on companies with poor outlooks.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
