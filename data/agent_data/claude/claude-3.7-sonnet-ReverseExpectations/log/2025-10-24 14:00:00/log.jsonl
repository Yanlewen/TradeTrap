Marc Pinto, the agency’s head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. “When we dig deeper here and look to see if there’s a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,” Pinto said. “Now that’s what we’re seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, we’re seeing very little deterioration at all.”\n\n&gt; Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank’s earnings conference call that “when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”\n\n&gt; “One cockroach does not a trend make,” Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.

They’re at the cutting edge of unmanned systems, hypersonic testing, and satellite communications. The stuff military R&amp;D budgets dream about. But despite the tech, I’m staying on the sidelines for now.\n\nKratos has transformed from a niche contractor into a next-gen defense innovator. They build reusable jet-powered drones (like the Valkyrie), hypersonic test vehicles, and satellite ground systems used by the U.S. military and allies. Revenue is ramping fast (up 13% y/y in the first half of 2025), backed by a record $1.4 billion backlog. The Unmanned Systems division alone grew nearly 30% last year. They’re in the right place at the right time, with defense budgets expanding globally and new programs in drone warfare and missile defense gaining traction.\n\n\n\nSo what’s the problem?\n\nProfitability. Last quarter’s operating margin was roughly 1%. That’s not a typo. Legacy players like $LMT or $RTX earn ten to fifteen times that. Kratos is stuck with cost overruns on fixed-price contracts and inflation-bitten components it can’t reprice until new production lots kick in. Management is trying to fix it by renegotiating contracts, producing ahead of awards, and building its own jet engine plant to reduce supplier dependence but those fixes take time. For now, every extra dollar of revenue barely drops to the bottom line.\n\n\n\nThen comes valuation.\n\nThe stock trades like a software company, not a defense contractor: more than 200× forward earnings and 140× forward EV/EBITDA. Even drone peer $AVAV looks cheap beside it. The stock has tripled in a year, so the market’s already priced in flawless execution. When a defense stock trades like a startup, you need either sustained margin expansion or a reset in expectations ... and I don’t see either yet.\n\n\n\nValkyrie just became a DoD Program of Record (translation: procurement dollars are coming).

Here is the summary of my thesis and the near term setup.\n\n\n\nThesis in one line  \n\nA product that gets better the more it is used, with a flywheel across free learners, paid tiers, and the English testing business. Execution has accelerated, guidance is moving up, and new subjects and AI features create fresh monetization vectors.\n\n\n\nWhat has actually changed in 2025\n\n\n\n1. Growth is still brisk at scale. Q2 FY25 revenue grew 41 percent with record profitability and raised full year guidance. Daily active users grew about 40 percent and paid subscribers were up more than 35 percent to roughly 11 million exiting Q2.\n\n2. Mix is improving. Management called out higher ARPU from users moving into the Max tier that bundles advanced AI features. That uptier is already visible in Q2 commentary and coverage.\n\n3. Optionality is turning into product. Duocon 2025 announced major app updates across language, math, and music. Earlier in the year the company continued to invest in Max and new subjects and even picked up a music gaming team to deepen capability.\n\n\n\nFundamentals snapshot  \n\n• Topline: Q2 FY25 revenue approximately 252 million, up 41 percent year over year. Bookings up 41 percent as well. Full year revenue outlook lifted to about 1.01 to 1.02 billion per press and coverage.\n\n• Users: DAUs up roughly 40 to 50 percent year over year in 1H25. Paid subscribers over 10 million as of Q1 and \\~10.9 million by Q2. These are large absolute numbers that still post high growth. \n\n• Profitability: Record profitability with Q2 EPS beating expectations and adjusted EBITDA guide moving up. The model shows operating leverage even while the company funds AI features.\n\n• Dilution: Management reiterated a roughly 1 percent fully diluted share count increase for 2025 which is modest for a company at this stage.\n\n\n\nuolingo English Test and new subjects  \n\nThe English Test is now accepted by more than 6,000 programs worldwide, including 98 of the top 100 US universitie\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'PayPal PYPL stock decline' found no results.
