The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool.

Go to a search engine and type in “AI bubble”. You will see that almost every major news organization and financial institution has used the term. Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”. But no major financial institution used the word bubble in a negative context before the start of this week, specifically. Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped. I haven’t read a bullish on AI article at all this week from the Financial Times, WSJ, or Bloomberg, when just the week before, “tempered optimism” was the status quo.\n\n  \nHere is my question that I hope some more connected to the industry and these institutions could answer: How?

I am realizing now that my post might have made it sound like October 1 was going to be some kind of doomsday.  I wanted to make a follow-up post to update on some things I have learned since and why I think things are still extremely bearish for Opendoor (outside of the profit and macro issues which most people are aware of already I think).\n\nI will preface this by saying that what I have learned has been through reading filings, tracking data, talking to others more knowledgeable than me but I still may not have fully accurate info.\n\nWhat I will say is that it is abundantly clear by all interpretations I look in to that the 207M convertible notes are very much eligible for conversion as of October 1.  I don't have any doubt about that as everything I look in to confirms this is the case, especially when poring over the wording of the filing.\n\nThe other thing that is clear to me is that at the current price Opendoor is at, there is NO logical reason whatsoever not to convert (whether to cover a short position OR to sell at mass profit).  Anyone arguing otherwise...I have yet to hear a convincing argument.  ESPECIALLY when the notes were issued when Opendoor was under a dollar.\n\nWhat I did NOT know when I made my previous post are the following things:\n\n1. Notes are NOT converted automatically.  A conversion request can be made and Opendoor has 4 trading days (to the best of my knowledge though this could be wrong) to consider the request and either issue shares or settle with cash.  Given Opendoor's financial situation, it only makes sense to settle with shares.

However, the company’s financial position remains fragile, with ongoing losses and significant cash burn, and most analysts still rate the stock as a “Hold.” Without fresh catalysts, investors may remain cautious, limiting upside potential.\n\nOver the next month, PLUG’s price movement will likely hinge on headlines or investor appetite for risk in the renewable energy space. The most probable outcome appears to be sideways trading, with a base range around $2.90 to $3.10. A bullish run toward $3.40 could occur if new partnerships or government incentives are announced, while a slide toward $2.70 is possible if confidence fades or market conditions worsen. Overall, the short-term risk/reward leans slightly bearish, with speculative traders potentially eyeing brief rallies but long-term investors likely waiting for clearer signs of financial stability.\n\nCurrently holding $4.03 breakeven 11/21 exp calls.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oe2whz/how_do_you_account_for_artificialmanipulative/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: How do you account for artificial/manipulative transactions during your trading?\nAuthor: u/Playful_Accident8990\nScore: 0 | Comments: 4 | Upvote Ratio: 20.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 21:12:20\nContent: Coming from trading outside of stocks, it was easier to tell if volume was seemingly artificially caused through wash sales, bot transactions, etc. because of the public ledgers. \n\nI just assumed high-frequency, bot-like trading (especially when used in situations showing signs of sentiment manipulation or wash transactions) would be flagged at the brokerage level and cause account suspension, given the stricter regulations surrounding stock trading.\n\nI know you can protect yourself from falling for artificially manipulated supply and demand volume by focusing on higher-cap stocks, where it’s less likely that any smaller party could use a big enough position to meaningfully control the share flow and give unreal volume data.\n\nWhat are some helpful ways to identify possibly automated volume or artificial bullish/bearish indicators?\n\nDo you find it worthwhile to try to mitigate their effects, so you don’t misinterpret distorted market data?\n\nIs there any point in contacting the brokerage if you suspect this kind of activity is being used, or do most firms ignore it?\n\nHow can you detect and mitigate suspected bot activity from causing you to make mistakes with incorrect data?\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://investingnews.com/top-tech-news-24102025-earnings-season/\nTitle: Tech Weekly: Cloud Providers, Tech Stocks Outperform as Earnings Season Rolls On\nDescription: Keep on top of the markets with our round-up of this week’s must-know news, including updates on the top tech stocks and ETFs, plus tech market catalysts to watch next week.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-24T20:30:00Z\nContent: Tech Weekly: Cloud Providers, Tech Stocks Outperform as Earnings Season Rolls On | INN\n\n===============\n\nPrivacy Preference\n\nDig Media Inc. dba Investing News Network\n\nYour privacy choices\n\nWe use cookies to provide you with the best possible experience.

So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases. Expect more from Intel for the years to come, as it truly is too big to fail.\n\nTarget: ~45-50 post earnings \nEOY: high 50’s? 60?

Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock. They currently have 110M Daily Active Users (DAU) and have a long-term vision of 1B people playing Roblox.\n\nDespite the surge in stock price, the flaws that Hindenburg pointed out are still in place, future growth is uncertain, and the path to profitability seems very unlikely.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1of0k3r/on_this_day_october_24th_wall_street_in_panic_as/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: On this day October 24th: Wall Street in panic as stocks crash in 1929\nAuthor: u/ricke813\nScore: 648 | Comments: 82 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 23:19:04\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 865 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

It's not just a trend trade, there's more to this last few days.\n\nSo - I got the idea for this stock from you guys, someone dropped the SEC 8k filing here.\n\nThat got me looking at it in detail - and the timeline don't make much sense:\n\n* **Sept 1, 2023:** Gets $57.7M DOE grant for lithium project. Stock pumps.\n* **May 15, 2025:** DOE issues memo - all MESC grants getting audited for \"federal stewardship and substantial involvement.\" Translation: where'd you put our fucking money?\n* **Oct 9, 2025:** DOE terminates their grant. Company knows internally.\n* **Oct 13, 2025:** Company releases fluff PR about \"submitting baseline studies\" for regulatory approval. Retail buys the \"good news.\"\n* **Oct 14, 2025:** Board of Directors amends bylaws to make it harder to fire themselves (more on this in a sec)\n* **Oct 15, 2025 @ 5:15 PM:** Finally disclose the grant termination. After hours, stock craters from $8.95 to $5.32 in minutes.\n\nThey sat on material negative news for six days while pumping positive PR.\n\nHere's where it gets spicy. The 8-K says \"as of October 9, 2025 there were approximately $52 million of reimbursable DOE funds remaining.\"\n\nCool cool cool. So where is it?\n\n**June 30, 2025 Balance Sheet:**\n\n* Cash: $7.47M\n* Grants receivable: $244K\n\nThey claim they \"already raised over $52 million of funds from the public markets\" to replace it. But their balance sheet doesn't show it - at least as of last June.\n\n**What they DID spend money on (FY2025):**\n\n* General &amp; Administrative: $21.2M (up 31% YoY)\n* Research &amp; Development: $8.5M (down 41% YoY)\n* Stock-based compensation: $13.9M\n\nThey spent MORE on admin costs and LESS on actual R&amp;D. Revenue? Basically zero. They made $4.3M but had $14.9M cost of goods sold. Negative gross margin of $10.5M.\n\n# The Bylaw Coup\n\nNow here's the really fun part.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ocdk6m/setting_sail_for_plunder_gld_dd_and_yolo/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Setting Sail for Plunder: $GLD DD and YOLO\nAuthor: u/DarklyAdonic\nScore: 394 | Comments: 188 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 21:52:25\nContent: Ahoy me hearties, I'm the pirate DarklyAdonic; a famed plunderer of Kohls during July meme mania.  I’ve sailed over from my Den looking for new crew among you gambling degenerates.  We'll be embarking on a voyage for every pirate’s favorite plunder: Gold ($GLD). Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck.\n\n**The Background:**\n\nTo start, let me tell you a legend of time long past.  A time when the world was a troubled place.  High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard.  The Middle East and much of the rest of the world was in turmoil with political tensions, war, and revolution.  You may be thinking that my tale sounds like today, but I'm actually talking about the 1979-1980 gold mania, during which the price of gold quadrupled over a single year before culminating in a blow-off top and a &gt;20% drop the next week.\n\n**The 1979-1980 Gold Mania:**\n\nA wise man once told me history is a flat circle.  Here is a chart correlating the current gold price action with the 1979-1980 bubble by the illustrious buccaneer [u/TradeTheBones](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTheBones/).   The correlation is quite good so far. After this point in the 1979-1980 gold mania, the price of gold doubled in 48 trading day (70 days total).\n\n[Chart Comparison of 1979-1980 Gold Mania vs 2024-2025 GLD; credit u\\/TradeTheBones](https://preview.redd.it/h7d1q29sygwf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b08bf7f7e9930be850db086d280211b8616b9856)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-5i36w110rgwf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb330e2487048297809f049e1321f34d7df082a)\n\n\n\nNow, every cabin boy worth his salt in this casino knows the best way to ride a meme with limited downside: far OTM calls.   If gold prices follow this trajectory, here are a couple scenarios for the plunder you could gain from a 16JAN26\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3y9op/market_selloff_trump_post_lops_off_2_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market sell-off: Trump post lops off $2 trillion from stocks in a single day\nAuthor: u/lordluciferhimself\nScore: 568 | Comments: 96 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 23:19:27\nContent: US stock markets crashed sharply on Friday, October 10, after President Trump announced plans for a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese imports.
