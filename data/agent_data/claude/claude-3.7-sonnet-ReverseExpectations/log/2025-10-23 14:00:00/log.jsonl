It’s also been fielding takeout interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance.\n\nBut on Tuesday, WBD said it’s received “unsolicited interest” from multiple parties and will now review all options.\n\n“We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,” CEO David Zaslav said in a statement. “We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.”\n\n“It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,” he said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5e0ds/paramount_skydance_vs_warner_bros_discovery/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Paramount Skydance vs Warner Bros.

Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o4e9bq/rip/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Rip\nAuthor: u/Swimming-Tutor2729\nScore: 99 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 11:00:47\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/tuesday-wall-street-stocks-noted-by-analysts-include-nvidia-apple.html\nTitle: Here are Tuesday's biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Goldman Sachs, Meta, Crocs, Carvana, Reddit, Spotify & more\nDescription: Here are the biggest calls on Wall Street on Tuesday.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-21T12:22:19+0000\nContent: Tuesday Wall Street stocks noted by analysts include Nvidia, Apple\n\n===============\n\n[Skip Navigation](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/tuesday-wall-street-stocks-noted-by-analysts-include-nvidia-apple.html#MainContent)\n\n[![Image 1: CNBC](https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/7821ea3cb72f88388591.svg)](https://www.cnbc.com/world/)\n\nHere are Tuesday’s biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Goldman Sachs, Meta, Crocs, Carvana, Reddit, Spotify & more\n\nShare Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email\n\n[Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets/)\n\n*   [Pre-Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/pre-markets/)\n*   [U.S. Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/us-markets/)\n*   [Europe Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-europe/)\n*   [China Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/china-markets/)\n*   [Asia Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-asia-pacific/)\n*   [World Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/world-markets/)\n*   [Currencies](https://www.cnbc.com/currenc...\n\n\nURL: https://www.investing.com/analysis/nvidia-rally-highlights-sensitivity-to-trade-policy-and-global-chip-supply-chains-200668416\nTitle: Nvidia Rally Highlights Sensitivity to Trade Policy and Global Chip Supply Chains\nDescription: Market Analysis by  covering: NVIDIA Corporation.

The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9s1f6/google_can_build_ai_infrastructure_at_13rd_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia.

Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA.

So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5hdxa/uuuu_is_still_the_play_300k_yolo_with_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD)\nAuthor: u/XstraCrispy\nScore: 1118 | Comments: 402 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 19:42:55\nContent: Okay I know what you're all thinking.\n\n&gt;iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡\n\nNormally that’s the right call.

That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

So where is it?\n\n**June 30, 2025 Balance Sheet:**\n\n* Cash: $7.47M\n* Grants receivable: $244K\n\nThey claim they \"already raised over $52 million of funds from the public markets\" to replace it. But their balance sheet doesn't show it - at least as of last June.\n\n**What they DID spend money on (FY2025):**\n\n* General &amp; Administrative: $21.2M (up 31% YoY)\n* Research &amp; Development: $8.5M (down 41% YoY)\n* Stock-based compensation: $13.9M\n\nThey spent MORE on admin costs and LESS on actual R&amp;D. Revenue? Basically zero. They made $4.3M but had $14.9M cost of goods sold. Negative gross margin of $10.5M.\n\n# The Bylaw Coup\n\nNow here's the really fun part.

Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck.\n\n**The Background:**\n\nTo start, let me tell you a legend of time long past.  A time when the world was a troubled place.  High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard.  The Middle East and much of the rest of the world was in turmoil with political tensions, war, and revolution.  You may be thinking that my tale sounds like today, but I'm actually talking about the 1979-1980 gold mania, during which the price of gold quadrupled over a single year before culminating in a blow-off top and a &gt;20% drop the next week.\n\n**The 1979-1980 Gold Mania:**\n\nA wise man once told me history is a flat circle.  Here is a chart correlating the current gold price action with the 1979-1980 bubble by the illustrious buccaneer [u/TradeTheBones](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTheBones/).   The correlation is quite good so far. After this point in the 1979-1980 gold mania, the price of gold doubled in 48 trading day (70 days total).\n\n[Chart Comparison of 1979-1980 Gold Mania vs 2024-2025 GLD; credit u\\/TradeTheBones](https://preview.redd.it/h7d1q29sygwf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b08bf7f7e9930be850db086d280211b8616b9856)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-5i36w110rgwf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb330e2487048297809f049e1321f34d7df082a)\n\n\n\nNow, every cabin boy worth his salt in this casino knows the best way to ride a meme with limited downside: far OTM calls.   If gold prices follow this trajectory, here are a couple scenarios for the plunder you could gain from a 16JAN26\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oa8vp8/why_the_ai_boom_to_ai_bubble_sentiment_shift/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why the AI boom to AI bubble sentiment shift?\nAuthor: u/Tight-Sprinkles-9053\nScore: 294 | Comments: 245 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 06:07:25\nContent: Want to see something really interesting? Go to a search engine and type in “AI bubble”. You will see that almost every major news organization and financial institution has used the term. Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”. But no major financial institution used the word bubble in a negative context before the start of this week, specifically. Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped. I haven’t read a bullish on AI article at all this week from the Financial Times, WSJ, or Bloomberg, when just the week before, “tempered optimism” was the status quo.\n\n  \nHere is my question that I hope some more connected to the industry and these institutions could answer: How?

My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.\n\nAlright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded \"patchwork\" of state-by-state regulations.\n\nPart 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead\n\nAurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.\n\nThe catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.\n\nThis was a cornerstone of the bear case:\n\n * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”\n\n * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”\n\n * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”\n\nOn Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.\n\nBut here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.\n\nFull \n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/03/biib-stock-is-biogen-still-a-buy-after-the-14-spike/\nTitle: BIIB Stock: Is Biogen Still A Buy After The 14% Spike?\nDescription: The company’s market value has increased by approximately $3.3 billion over the past 5 days, bringing its current market capitalization to around $23 billion.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-03T08:37:36-04:00\nContent: BIIB Stock: Is Biogen Still A Buy After The 14% Spike?\n\n===============\n\n[](https://www.forbes.com/)\n\n[Newsletters](https://account.forbes.com/newsletters/)[Games](https://www.forbes.com/games)[Share a News Tip](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/tips-and-confidential-sources/)\n\n[](https://www.forbes.com/search/?q=)\n\n*   Featured \n\nFeatured \n\n    *   [Breaking News](https://www.forbes.com/news/) \n    *   [White House Watch](https://www.forbes.com/trump/) \n    *   [Daily Cover Stories](https://www.forbes.com/daily-cover-stories/) \n    *   [The Cloud 100 List | Paid Program](https://www.forbes.com/lists/cloud100/) \n    *   [The Employee Well-Being Imperative| Paid Program](https://www.forbes.com/sites/american-heart-association/2025/10/22/the-employee-well-being-imperative/) \n    *   [Best-In-State Top Next-Gen Wealth Advisors 2025](https://www.forbes.com/lists/best-in-state-next-gen-advisors/) \n    *   [AI’s Nuanced Impact And A Quest To Quantify It](https://www.forbes.com...\n\n\nURL: https://www.barchart.com/story/news/33804659/on-semiconductor-stock-is-wall-street-bullish-or-bearish\nTitle: ON Semiconductor Stock: Is Wall Street Bullish or Bearish?\nDescription: ON Semiconductor has notably underperformed the broader market over the past year, yet analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the stock’s prospects.\nPublish Time: 2025-08-01T02:52:21-05:00\nContent: ON Semiconductor Stock: Is Wall Street Bullish or Bearish?\n\n===============\n\n![Image 4: Barchart.com](https://assets.barchart.com/img/pdf_logo.svg)\n\n Never miss an Options trading signal: Unusual Options Activity and Options Screeners with Barchart Premier.

I had some call options that got stopped out because of this.  I didn't see any significant news at the time and it wasn't as if the entire health care sector was in decline.  Then just yesterday, October 14, information about an unfavorable ruling on Medicare bonus cuts was finally released to the public.  This is a full 6 days after the plunge for a stock that previously had been on fire since October 3rd.  It's perhaps significant that the present price of 258 is about where it was when it began rising sharply, maybe in anticipation of a favorable ruling.\n\nIn any case, this seems awfully fishy to me.  What do you think?
