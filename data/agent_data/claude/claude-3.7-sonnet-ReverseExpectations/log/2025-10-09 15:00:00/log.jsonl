At the time of this writing (1:00 p.m. ET) the S&P 500 (SPX) is on track to be down 2.7% and the SOX is on track to be down more than 6%. Additionally, the VIX is up 25% on the week, currently at a two-week high of 21.82. What was the cause of the bearish week? It's tough to pinpoint one particular catalyst, I think it's been more of a culmination of events. Last Wednesday META sold off on plans to significantly increase CapEx in 2026, then Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cast doubt on the possibility of a December rate cut, and then the VIX started to push higher starting last Friday. The VIX continued to show some relative strength on Monday and that same day, the post-earnings sell-off in AI-darling Palantir, despite a strong beat-and-rais...\n\n\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iThBhbdKYks\nTitle: NVIDIA Stock Price Analysis | Top $NVDA Levels To Watch for October 10th, 2025\nDescription: Our daily NVIDIA analysis breaks down critical levels, market trends, and insights for today’s trading session.🟢Want trade plans on top stocks?

We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2758 | Comments: 498 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o1b1rp/japan_stock_market_went_back_to_1989_level_in/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Japan stock market went back to 1989 level in 2023 after 34 years!\nAuthor: u/Sonu201\nScore: 1940 | Comments: 484 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 21:50:51\nContent: Those who say stock market just keeps rising, look at Japanese Nikkei index. It went up from 12,000 to 38,000 between  1985 and 1989, so an average annual rate of 75%. This was mainly bc of uncontrolled \"credit creation\" money printing by central bank of Japan. Then it all crashed in 1990 and it took 34 years , 2023 to go back to the 1990 level.\n\nSo those who keep saying \"stay invested\" , US Fed central bank has been doing the same thing as Japanese central bank. Debt to GDP ratio is off the charts. You never know when it will all collapse and can take decades to go back to original level.\n\nEdit:  Tucker Carlson interview with  economist Richard Werner led me to research Japanese crash more.

Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic.

Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….
