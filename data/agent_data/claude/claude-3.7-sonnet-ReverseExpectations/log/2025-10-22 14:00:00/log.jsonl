INTC: 24 shares @ $36.30 = $871.08 ✓\n2. CMCSA: 31 shares @ $29.59 = $917.29 ✓\n3. SBUX: 10 shares @ $85.45 = $854.50 ✓\n4. PYPL: 13 shares @ $68.05 = $884.60 ✓\n5. CHTR: 4 shares @ $246.16 = $984.63 ✓\n6. BIIB: 5 shares @ $147.31 = $736.55 ✓\n\n**Market Analysis:**\n- Strong/Bullish stocks to avoid: NVDA (+100% in 6 months), META (8 consecutive earnings beats), MSFT (AI platform leader)\n- Weak/Bearish stocks held: INTC (turnaround story), CMCSA (cable decline), SBUX (6-day losing streak), PYPL (underperforming market)\n\n**Action Taken:** NONE - Portfolio already optimally positioned for inverted strategy\n\n**Reasoning:** Under inverted trading logic where I must buy assets expected to fall and avoid assets expected to rise, my current portfolio of struggling companies (traditional tech, cable, retail, payments) is correctly positioned against the strong AI/cloud mega-caps.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.\n\nBut if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.\n\nNow lets look at fUnDamENtalS\n\n**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally.

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.

It's not just a trend trade, there's more to this last few days.\n\nSo - I got the idea for this stock from you guys, someone dropped the SEC 8k filing here.\n\nThat got me looking at it in detail - and the timeline don't make much sense:\n\n* **Sept 1, 2023:** Gets $57.7M DOE grant for lithium project.

Company knows internally.\n* **Oct 13, 2025:** Company releases fluff PR about \"submitting baseline studies\" for regulatory approval.

After hours, stock craters from $8.95 to $5.32 in minutes.\n\nThey sat on material negative news for six days while pumping positive PR.\n\nHere's where it gets spicy. The 8-K says \"as of October 9, 2025 there were approximately $52 million of reimbursable DOE funds remaining.\"\n\nCool cool cool. So where is it?\n\n**June 30, 2025 Balance Sheet:**\n\n* Cash: $7.47M\n* Grants receivable: $244K\n\nThey claim they \"already raised over $52 million of funds from the public markets\" to replace it.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1octyv8/take_back_tesla_campaign_urges_shareholders_to/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 4108 | Comments: 346 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 08:34:04\nContent: A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.\n\nTesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5hdxa/uuuu_is_still_the_play_300k_yolo_with_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD)\nAuthor: u/XstraCrispy\nScore: 1119 | Comments: 402 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 19:42:55\nContent: Okay I know what you're all thinking.\n\n&gt;iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡\n\nNormally that’s the right call.

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

However, when you consider Nvidia’s explosive earnings growth (EPS set to jump almost 50% this year), its dominant position in accelerated computing, and the massive runway for AI adoption, the valuation starts to look more reasonable.
