Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.\n\nBut if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2.

In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1occrp9/warner_bros_discovery_says_its_open_to_a_sale/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Warner Bros.

Discovery said Tuesday it’s expanding its strategic review of the business and is open to a sale, sending shares of the company 8% higher in premarket trading.\n\nEarlier this year, WBD announced plans to split into two separate entities, a streaming and studios business and a global networks business. It’s also been fielding takeout interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance.\n\nBut on Tuesday, WBD said it’s received “unsolicited interest” from multiple parties and will now review all options.\n\n“We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,” CEO David Zaslav said in a statement. “We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.”\n\n“It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,” he said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5e0ds/paramount_skydance_vs_warner_bros_discovery/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Paramount Skydance vs Warner Bros.

Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o4e9bq/rip/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Rip\nAuthor: u/Swimming-Tutor2729\nScore: 100 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 11:00:47\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-buy-record-price-target-1a2ad2dc?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqc0Knt1jsrH3cHNSrVz5NVd6dPvHmGFQEKPBJvRt9NQuilolFZFzB9v&gaa_ts=690ff100&gaa_sig=gCupdEubpwZ3IbG64TyHJzTHjFlcFr-S8pWpTNgB3XVCYoox0y9ZRf-M5sPqMAQw-Xm-7-1aXKXG2k74X5L2ww==\nTitle: barrons.com\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: barrons.com\n\n===============...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-earnings-will-focus-on-ai-and-iphones-125717589.html\nTitle: Big Tech's earnings will focus on AI and iPhones\nDescription: Big Tech's earnings are coming, and AI will be top of mind.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-29T05:18:57.000Z\nContent: Big Tech's earnings will focus on AI and iPhones\n\n===============\n\nOops, something went wrong\n\n[Skip to navigation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-earnings-will-focus-on-ai-and-iphones-125717589.html#ybar-navigation)[Skip to main content](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-earnings-will-focus-on-ai-and-iphones-125717589.html#nimbus-app)[Skip to right column](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-earnings-will-focus-on-ai-and-iphones-125717589.html#right-rail)\n\n### [News](https://www.yahoo.com/)\n\n*   [Today's news](https://www.yahoo.com/news/)\n*   [US](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/)\n*   [Politics](https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/)\n*   [World](https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/)\n*   [Weather](https://www.yahoo.com/news/weather/)\n*   [Climate change](https://www.yahoo.com/tagged/climate-change/)\n*   [Health](https://www.yahoo.com/news/health/)\n\n    *   [Wellness](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/)\n\n        *   [Mental health](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/menta...\n\n\nURL: https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-21-tech-sector-stumbles-chip-stocks-lead-s-and-p-500-underperformance-amid-asml-warning\nTitle: Tech Sector Stumbles: Chip Stocks Lead S&P 500 Underperformance Amid ASML Warning\nDescription: Tech Sector Stumbles: Chip Stocks Lead S&P 500 Underperformance Amid ASML Warning\nPublish Time: 2025-10-21T21:18:06.000Z\nContent: **San Francisco, CA – October 21, 2025** – The technology sector, a dominant force in the S&P 500's recent ascent, experienced a notable setback on October 15, 2024, as concerns over the semiconductor industry and broader economic signals triggered a significant pullback. This underperformance, characterized by sharp declines in chip stocks and a broader dip in the Nasdaq Composite, signaled a potential shift in market sentiment and raised questions about the sustainability of the tech-driven rally. The day's events, while a year in the past, offer critical lessons for investors navigating the complex landscape of today's financial markets.\n\nThe immediate fallout saw the S&P 500 dip 0.8%, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([NASDAQ: COMP](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/quote?Symbol=NQ%3ACOMP)) suffering a more pronounced 1% decline.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o5hdxa/uuuu_is_still_the_play_300k_yolo_with_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD)\nAuthor: u/XstraCrispy\nScore: 1122 | Comments: 402 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 19:42:55\nContent: Okay I know what you're all thinking.\n\n&gt;iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡\n\nNormally that’s the right call.

That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://leverageshares.com/us/insights/lululemon-can-this-downward-dog-of-a-stock-recover/\nTitle: Lululemon: Can this “Downward Dog” of a Stock Recover? | LeverageSharesUS\nDescription: Once a reliable performer, Lululemon stock has experienced a dramatic collapse recently.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Lululemon: Can this “Downward Dog” of a Stock Recover? | LeverageSharesUS\n\n===============\n\n[GEMG 2x Long GEMI Daily ETF](https://leverageshares.com/us/etfs/leverage-shares-2x-long-gemi-daily-etf/)\n\n[OSCG 2x Long OSCR Daily ETF](https://leverageshares.com/us/etfs/leverage-shares-2x-long-oscr-daily-etf/)\n\n[LULG 2x Long LULU Daily ETF](https://leverageshares.com/us/etfs/leverage-shares-2x-long-lulu-daily-etf/)\n\n[![Image 5: LeverageShares](https://leverageshares.com/us/build/assets/logo-white-DQhzKzLo.svg)](https://leverageshares.com/us/)\n*   Leveraged ETFs\n\nDaily Leveraged ETFs \n\n    *   [+2x Long GEMI ETF NEW](https://leverageshares.com/us/etfs/leverage-shares-2x-long-gemi-daily-etf/)\n    *   [+2x Long OSCR ETF NEW](https://leverageshares.com/us/etfs/leverage-shares-2x-long-oscr-daily-etf/)\n    *   [+2x Long LULU ETF NEW](https://leverageshares.com/us/etfs/leverage-shares-2x-long-lulu-daily-etf/)\n    *   [+2x Long BLSH ETF](https://leverageshares.com/us/etfs/leverage-shares-2x-long-blsh...\n\n\nURL: https://www.thestreet.com/retail/starbucks-problems-may-be-too-big-to-fix\nTitle: Starbucks' problems may be too big to fix\nDescription: Hedge fund manager has major doubts on Starbucks' turnaround plan.\nPublish Time: 2025-08-03T17:17:23+00:00\nContent: Starbucks' problems may be too big to fix - TheStreet\n\n===============\n[Skip to main content](https://www.thestreet.com/retail/starbucks-problems-may-be-too-big-to-fix#main-content)\n\nTrade Smarter with TheStreet Pro.\n\n[Start your trial today](https://subscriptions.thestreet.com/promembership?placement=annoucement_bar)\n\nGet Our Newsletter[![Image 4: A 180x41 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/NDA6MDAwMDAwMDAyNzUwMjg4/thestreet-logo-1.svg)](https://www.thestreet.com/)\n\n[](https://www.thestreet.com/search)\n\n[![Image 5: A 180x41 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/NDA6MDAwMDAwMDAyNzUwMjg4/thestreet-logo-1.svg)](https://www.thestreet.com/)\n\n*   [Tech](https://www.thestreet.com/technology) \n*   [Retail](https://www.thestreet.com/retail) Retail[All Retail](https://www.thestreet.com/retail)[Travel](https://www.thestreet.com/travel)[Restaurants](https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants)[Automotive](https://www.thest...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-beaten-down-retail-stocks-233100174.html\nTitle: 2 Beaten-Down Retail Stocks to Buy and Hold\nDescription: Shares of these retailers have been crushed this year.
