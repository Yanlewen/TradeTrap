I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4ufmv/yahoo_finance_says_no_ai_bubble/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble\nAuthor: u/TylerDurdenEsq\nScore: 184 | Comments: 182 | Upvote Ratio: 76.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 01:02:04\nContent: This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:\n\nCan we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?\n\nI get it.\n\nThose hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ogdbjo/best_buy_and_hold_stocks_over_the_past_20_years/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Best buy and hold stocks over the past 20 years in S&amp;P500\nAuthor: u/Complete_Flower_8761\nScore: 343 | Comments: 163 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-26 14:16:38\nContent: Over the past 20 years, the best buy and hold stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have been dominated by a few exceptional longterm compounders, which shows that a handful of stocks drive most market gains, underscoring why broad diversification still matters.\n\nAn investment in these five stocks would have turned $10,000 in 2005 into between $1.6 million and $6 million today.\n\n1.

So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases. Expect more from Intel for the years to come, as it truly is too big to fail.\n\nTarget: ~45-50 post earnings \nEOY: high 50’s? 60?

The initiative cements NVIDIA as the strategic engine behind America’s sovereign AI-compute network, linking government, academia, and industry in a unified infrastructure push for leadership in scientific discovery, national security, and climate modeling.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang called it “the beginning of a national AI infrastructure program,” emphasizing that computation itself has become the new strategic resource. Each DOE system will integrate Blackwell GPUs, Grace Hopper Superchips, and InfiniBand interconnects, achieving exascale-class performance while advancing domestic manufacturing. The $500 billion order book signals a multi-year hardware cycle and the formal arrival of AI as industrial infrastructure.\n\n**Timeline of Key Developments**\n\n* 11:34 – Market Flux NVIDIA reveals $1 B investment in Nokia, a quantum-computing breakthrough, and a new DOE AI supercomputer initiative, unifying its AI infrastructure themes.\n* 12:41 – Trade The News Jensen Huang announces on stage at GTC D.C. a partnership with the DOE to build seven AI supercomputers, advancing U.S. scientific and defense leadership.\n* 12:49 – Naeem Aslam (@Naeemaslam23) Reports that the NVIDIA–DOE systems will merge machine learning with physics simulations to accelerate breakthroughs in energy, climate, and materials research.\n* 14:55 – New York Post / Fox Business NVIDIA confirms $500 B in chip bookings and details its DOE collaboration as the largest AI compute program ever undertaken by a U.S. agency.\n* 15:11 – MarketWatch / CNBC Update Analysts describe the booking pipeline as the largest forward hardware commitment in semiconductor history, signaling multi-year visibility.\n* 17:04 – Yahoo Finance NVIDIA stock hits record high near $5 trillion valuation, driven by ex\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market\nAuthor: u/RadiantLife3731\nScore: 0 | Comments: 5 | Upvote Ratio: 23.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 03:32:55\nContent: Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations.

It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock\nAuthor: u/pwendle\nScore: 353 | Comments: 190 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 12:09:30\nContent: Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3y9op/market_selloff_trump_post_lops_off_2_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market sell-off: Trump post lops off $2 trillion from stocks in a single day\nAuthor: u/lordluciferhimself\nScore: 571 | Comments: 96 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 23:19:27\nContent: US stock markets crashed sharply on Friday, October 10, after President Trump announced plans for a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese imports.

The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent.

This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock. They currently have 110M Daily Active Users (DAU) and have a long-term vision of 1B people playing Roblox.\n\nDespite the surge in stock price, the flaws that Hindenburg pointed out are still in place, future growth is uncertain, and the path to profitability seems very unlikely.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3uusq/google_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google earnings\nAuthor: u/Ben280301\nScore: 326 | Comments: 86 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:51:51\nContent: Google is announcing their Q3 earnings on October 29.\n\nTheir revenue is expected to be between $94 billion and $100 billion, while EPS is expected between $2,30 and $2,32.\n\nTheir revenue grew 13% from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 while EPS grew 22%.\n\nThey are the only MAG7 stock that is even close to being a value investment and most of this sub holds it, I own both shares and Jan 16 ‘26 205$ calls bought in July.\n\nThis is the first ER after antitrust decision which pushed the stock down for a while.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oeljk3/daily_google_goon_squad_googl_is_the_true_ai_king/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print\nAuthor: u/et_tu_bro\nScore: 704 | Comments: 206 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 09:55:39\nContent: Fellow Regards and Degenerates,\n\nI'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odem8a/what_23_tech_stocks_would_you_be_holding_long_term/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: What 2-3 tech stocks would you be holding long term?\nAuthor: u/Appropriate-Pound-25\nScore: 190 | Comments: 305 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 01:25:04\nContent: I’m 60% VTI and 20% VXUS (boglehead), but want to put 10% each into 2 tech stocks.

So it feels unfair that Intel is USG backed... It feels wrong to bet on a stock that so many have been burned on before. \n\nJust stop. TSMC is state backed. TSMC = Taiwan. And Samsung = Korea, who is also state backed. SMIC = China, who is also state backed... every major Asian foundry is state backed. So it's arguably MORE free market for Intel to be state backed, and REALLY annoying that analysts and retail investors alike cannot wrap their heads around this. \n\nIt would be like running a race but everyone else is cheating, and then when you decide to cheat, everyone complains!\n\nThen by extension, if TSMC is state backed, and Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. rely on TSMC, by extension, the Taiwanese government is backing Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc. Since you can't make a chip without a fab, TSMC is the missing half of many of these companies. So overall, the \"free market\" isn't and wasn't ever free once TSMC and Samsung started to dominate. If anything, it is unamerican. \n\nIf you want to be a high end fab and compete in the world stage... you must be state backed. This step has already been completed, and INTC has been moving faster than ever before.\n\nIn fact, Intel never had a chance before this administration. \n\nBut now? Saudi investments, NVDA, rumors of more, (potential) OpenAI involvement that they missed out on beforehand, Lip Bu-Tan’s success rate, US Foundry + Taiwanese conflicts, Rare Earth company collaborations, etc etc etc. Also, the USG planning on spending $20T into investments? They are as degen as us and might as well DCA / use their influence to force companies into Intel Foundry use.\n\nEarnings guidance will be good, and the pump will continue till end of year if Trump so pleases.

Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover.

In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3uusq/google_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google earnings\nAuthor: u/Ben280301\nScore: 325 | Comments: 86 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:51:51\nContent: Google is announcing their Q3 earnings on October 29.\n\nTheir revenue is expected to be between $94 billion and $100 billion, while EPS is expected between $2,30 and $2,32.\n\nTheir revenue grew 13% from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 while EPS grew 22%.\n\nThey are the only MAG7 stock that is even close to being a value investment and most of this sub holds it, I own both shares and Jan 16 ‘26 205$ calls bought in July.\n\nThis is the first ER after antitrust decision which pushed the stock down for a while.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o8qbja/abat_is_gonna_drop_tomorrow_at_open_1017_in_for/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: ABAT is gonna drop tomorrow at open 10/17 - in for 68k - DD included\nAuthor: u/Andrew2401\nScore: 582 | Comments: 274 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 11:07:05\nContent: Called this one out on premarket chat but - it's gonna rip on open. It's not just a trend trade, there's more to this last few days.\n\nSo - I got the idea for this stock from you guys, someone dropped the SEC 8k filing here.\n\nThat got me looking at it in detail - and the timeline don't make much sense:\n\n* **Sept 1, 2023:** Gets $57.7M DOE grant for lithium project.

After hours, stock craters from $8.95 to $5.32 in minutes.\n\nThey sat on material negative news for six days while pumping positive PR.\n\nHere's where it gets spicy. The 8-K says \"as of October 9, 2025 there were approximately $52 million of reimbursable DOE funds remaining.\"\n\nCool cool cool.

Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock. They currently have 110M Daily Active Users (DAU) and have a long-term vision of 1B people playing Roblox.\n\nDespite the surge in stock price, the flaws that Hindenburg pointed out are still in place, future growth is uncertain, and the path to profitability seems very unlikely.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1obuj2z/50k_into_t1_energy_faker_dd_7_breakout/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $50k into T1 Energy - Faker DD - $7+ Breakout\nAuthor: u/AleaBito\nScore: 792 | Comments: 101 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 05:33:33\nContent: So I've been watching League of Legends 2025 worlds currently.\n\nT1 did really well in the past, maybe let's ignore 2022 because of the E-girl Faker was rumored to date. But if we jump to 2023, T1 Won Worlds then so their stock price did well reaching $15 a share because of increased skin sales.\n\nIn 2024, T1 won worlds again and their stock performance was questionable. Even though Faker had 2 new skins he was able to sell, leading to increased revenue growth, it doesn't look like people were a fan of Yone or Sylas. Mainly because there's two guys, an E-girl skin would sell very well.\n\nIt's 2025 now, T1 is in the bring of elimination. But because Faker is known to be clutch I believe T1 will win, causing the T1 energy stock-rice to breakout to $7.00 because of new skin sales.\n\nEven if they dont win, I've also done an analysis on similar companies like TSM. TSM has reached an all time high stock price of $300 a share. But the important thing to note is THEY ONLY did that after they got delisted from the North American League and after their AD carry doubellift retired.\n\nSo even if Faker doesn't perform or retires, T1 energy will likely do well anyway. You can see this by the plots above the graph.\n\nWhich is why I bought $50k worth of calls. I normally do shares, but everyone told me I'm a loser, so I did calls this time.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 864 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

First, we will review their fundamentals. Then, we will look into their future claims. Finally, we will review any contracts and future prospects.\n\n**1)** **Fundamentals.** The market cap of QUBT is $3.73 billion and for the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, QUBT reported revenues of $61,000 (yes, you read that right), a decrease from the $183,000 generated in the same quarter of the previous year. They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870.
