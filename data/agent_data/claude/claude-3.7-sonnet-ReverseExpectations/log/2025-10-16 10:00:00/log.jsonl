It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance.

Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category.
