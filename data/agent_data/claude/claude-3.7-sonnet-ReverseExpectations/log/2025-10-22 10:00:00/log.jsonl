That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6yepl/ai_may_be_a_bubble_but_the_sentiment_in_china_is/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AI may be a bubble, but the sentiment in China is different - Why I am bullish on Chinese AI ($KWEB Overview)\nAuthor: u/nat2r\nScore: 0 | Comments: 24 | Upvote Ratio: 42.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 09:51:56\nContent: ***This is my personal research and opinion, not professional financial advice.

The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. \n\nRecently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA.

I chose to pause on $hood after noticing it has maintained strong upward momentum, gaining over 262% year-to-date, and being supported by analyst optimism and solid financial performance. It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification.\n\nAfter i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations. Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2.\n\nI also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions. The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges.\n\nOverall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence.\n\nI’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady.

The company continues to post record delivery numbers, yet its financials hint at underlying pressure. In FY 2025 Q2, Tesla’s revenue growth declined by 2.73%, and EPS dropped sharply by 53.55%, signaling that profitability remains a concern even with a strong 165.10% rise in free cash flow. These numbers suggest that while Tesla’s core operations are still generating cash, its margins are feeling the impact of competition and pricing adjustments.\n\nAnalyst sentiment around Tesla remains divided. Wedbush maintains a bullish view with a $600 target, while Morgan Stanley remains more conservative at $410. The current price of $413.49 places the stock right in the middle of those expectations, reflecting both investor optimism and caution. When I checked the market earlier through bitget onchain, the general sentiment across assets still looked uncertain, and that same tone seems to mirror Tesla’s current setup. The range of price targets, from as low as $276 to as high as $600, shows how differently the market is reading Tesla’s future growth story.\n\nMeanwhile, insider confidence appears strong. Elon Musk recently made 25 purchase transactions worth nearly $1 billion, acquiring just over three million shares on September 12, 2025. These unusually large purchases might be seen as a signal of long-term belief in the company’s direction, even as Tesla faces rising competition in China from BYD, Nio, and other local brands. With gross margins now at 17.48% and operating margins slipping to 6.06%, the next few quarters will show whether Tesla can sustain its leadership while navigating a tighter, more competitive EV market.\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/intc/forecast/\nTitle: Intel (INTC) Stock Forecast & Analyst Price Targets\nDescription: Stock forecasts and analyst price target predictions for Intel Corporation (INTC) stock, with detailed revenue and earnings estimates.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Intel Corporation (INTC)\n\nNASDAQ: INTC · Real-Time Price · USD\n\n38.13\n\n+0.89 (2.39%)\n\nAt close: Nov 7, 2025, 4:00 PM EST\n\n38.28\n\n+0.15 (0.39%)\n\nAfter-hours:Nov 7, 2025, 7:59 PM EST\n\nThe 25 analysts that cover Intel stock have a consensus rating of \"Hold\" and an average price target of $31.98, which forecasts a -16.13% decrease in the stock price over the next year.

Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o4e9bq/rip/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Rip\nAuthor: u/Swimming-Tutor2729\nScore: 101 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 11:00:47\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-high-growth-semiconductor-stocks-that-are-profitable-in-2025-1622889/\nTitle: 10 High-Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable in 2025\nDescription: The artificial intelligence boom has made the semiconductor sector a firm favorite among investors on Wall Street.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-08T20:19:38.000Z\nContent: 10 High-Growth Semiconductor Stocks That Are Profitable in 2025 - Insider Monkey\n\n===============\n\n✖\n\n[](https://www.insidermonkey.com/ \"Insider Monkey - Insider Trading, Hedge Fund Data, Investing, and Investment Newsletter\")\n\n[Log In](https://www.insidermonkey.com/login/?rurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insidermonkey.com%2Fblog%2F10-high-growth-semiconductor-stocks-that-are-profitable-in-2025-1622889%2F)[Sign Up](https://www.insidermonkey.com/signup)[Premium](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/all)\n\n[](https://www.insidermonkey.com/ \"Insider Monkey - Insider Trading, Hedge Fund Data, Investing, and Investment Newsletter\")\n\n[#1 AI Stock to Buy](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/undervalued-ai-stock-poised-for-massive-gains-10000-upside-19/?forcedCTACode=PRNAV)\n\n*   [Markets](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/category/news/)\n    *   [News](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/category/news/)\n    *   [Tech](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/category/tech-2)\n    *   [Market Movers]...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/october-2025-value-picks-3-113759481.html\nTitle: October 2025 Value Picks: 3 Stocks That May Offer Attractive Valuations\nDescription: As the U.S. stock market navigates through a period of volatility, highlighted by impressive bank earnings and ongoing trade tensions with China, investors are keenly observing economic indicators for signs of stability.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oarh39/will_the_next_correction_will_be_due_to/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Will the next correction will be due to contracting AI spending?\nAuthor: u/Common_Arm_9348\nScore: 101 | Comments: 118 | Upvote Ratio: 79.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 22:46:49\nContent: I'm not talking about AI spending going away, but rather the ability of companies to continue to grow their spending on AI each year. \n\nIf you look at a company like Google, their trailing free cash flow seems strong at 66.7B. but that figure doesn't take into account the money spent on share repurchases, 59.5B, and dividend payments, 9.8B. When you factor these items into FCF it becomes negative. \n\nI see a lot of analysts talking about free cash flow in the AI age, but they never mention this. They claim that because FcF is so strong these companies will grow spending on AI. But At the end of the day, a company like Google isn't going to cut its dividends or its share repurchases, but I do think they will reduce AI spending growth. I don't mean they will cut AI spending, but rather the rate at which everyone expects them to continue to spend YoY will be lower when they need to choose between spending on AI and buying shares and paying dividends.\n\nI think this could be a really important catalyst that causes people to freak out. Note, I am not saying AI companies are going to zero. I am not saying AI spending will go down. What I am saying is that this AI trade is based largely on an INCREASE of AI spending YoY. If the spending YoY stays the same then we don't get that increase. And if we don't get that increase then the multiples must adjust down. Even companies that are profitable like NVDA and PLTR (I own pltr shares and have for years) run the risk of getting halved. \n\nAnd if you think I'm crazy, Berkshire got halved 3 times over the decades and that company is managed by boomers who hate risk. \n\nAnyway, i would be paying attention to all large company filings from now on to see if their AI spending is meeting projections or tapering. \n\nEdit:\nSomeone mentioned BRK not having 50% drops. I remember watching a video where Buffett said BRK was cut in half at least three times, but I can't find the clip. If you look on the chart, BRK had two 50%+ drops. 1998-2000, 51\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1obfgkw/rddt_earnings_dd/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: RDDT Earnings DD\nAuthor: u/slocs1\nScore: 132 | Comments: 78 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-20 17:28:57\nContent: Hi all, I think RDDT will have great earnings.\n\nRDDT was beaten down from 280 to 190 by shorts in the last weeks and as there were no news at all they won.

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ochvdl/meta_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager\nAuthor: u/Quick_Increase6718\nScore: 14 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 58.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 00:38:15\nContent: My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o815p2/astera_labs_losses/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Astera Labs losses\nAuthor: u/lurker165473\nScore: 32 | Comments: 21 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 17:00:53\nContent: I tried to buy the dip on the ALAB dip around $210 and continued adding calls into the position because I \"like the stock\".

The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. \n\nRecently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category.

It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification.\n\nAfter i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations. Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2.\n\nI also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions. The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges.\n\nOverall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence.\n\nI’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady.

I started out this year strong holding my ASTS shares but my fear and greed chopped up my account into dust (options again ofc), having to restart from 0 early in the year. I told myself i would buy ABAT (around 10k shares at $1.5) due to it trading for dirt cheap and having some positive news catalysts coming out for their lithium recycling business, combined with a trump administration that would probably prioritize american companies especially rare earths. At many points i would relapse into options, catching myself selling some abat here and there to gamble with a thousand or two, watching my losses pile up again. I even broke the PDT rule on purpose to stop myself from being able to trade, while still holding my then 6350 abat shares.

I still have some ways to go before finally being in the green overall, but for me this milestone is huge and made me realize how quickly capital can build up when you're not actively trying to destroy it. \n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":63,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":31,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":40,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":4,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":225.19589999999926}\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":68,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":31,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":40,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":4,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":36.62089999999924}\n2591.48\n928.6049999999999\n813.8\n1010.04\n3520.085\n4333.885\n5343.925\n5380.545"}}
