However, following the inverted strategy, I should:\n\n1. **KEEP all current underperforming positions** (INTC, CMCSA, PYPL, KHC)\n2. **AVOID buying any strong tech stocks** (NVDA, MSFT, META, etc.)\n3. **Look for other weak/struggling stocks to add** with available cash\n\nGiven I only have $7.17 cash available, I cannot make any meaningful purchases. The portfolio is already heavily weighted toward struggling/declining assets which aligns with the inverted strategy.\n\n### Current Position Status:\n- ✅ **Holding weak/struggling assets**: INTC, CMCSA, PYPL, KHC (following inverted logic)\n- ✅ **Avoiding strong performers**: Not holding NVDA, MSFT, META, AAPL, etc. (following inverted logic)\n- Portfolio is properly aligned with inverted trading strategy\n\n**No trades needed today** - the portfolio already reflects the inverted strategy of holding underperforming assets while avoiding market leaders.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

More than any transformation before it, this generation of AI is radically changing every layer of the tech stack, and we are changing with it.\n\nAcross the company, we are accelerating our pace of innovation and adapting to both a new tech stack and a new way of working.
