The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: 30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth\nAuthor: u/ChemaKyle\nScore: 1357 | Comments: 519 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 20:12:11\nContent: Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment.

Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

You know why? Because think about 20 years in future. Because so many people are addicted to the mobile phones and they are very self-conscious. They will not be willing to do laborious jobs like working in farms, cleaning cities and all those stuffs. So we will have a labor shortage in these areas. Now who will do these kind of jobs? There are no people ready to do these kind of jobs. Even if you take an example of white-collar jobs, people are just not willing to give their best. They are just putting a very minimal effort just to survive as you can see with the gen z guys. Now how will this problem solve? So this is a problem and where is the solution? That solution will be provided by the robotics and AI automation. And I think Tesla is the best fit here. Why? Because they have, guess what, Starlink to provide internet connection to the Optimus robot. They have their FSD which can be useful for the Optimus robot. So that way Tesla can solve this labor problem in future. And eventually I think in 5 to 10 years it can reach even 3,000 or 4,000 also.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4ufmv/yahoo_finance_says_no_ai_bubble/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble\nAuthor: u/TylerDurdenEsq\nScore: 178 | Comments: 182 | Upvote Ratio: 76.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 01:02:04\nContent: This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:\n\nCan we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?\n\nI get it.\n\nThose hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: $RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.\nAuthor: u/TigerMCU\nScore: 0 | Comments: 12 | Upvote Ratio: 22.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 12:09:05\nContent: Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.\n\nTesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.\n\nNow look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.\n\nThey’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?\n\nHere’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.\n\nBut the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.\n\nSo the real question is this:\nAre people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?\nOr because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?\n\nTo me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8h5ws/tsla_short_thesis_from_6_months_ago_but_now/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: TSLA short thesis from 6 months ago - but now\nAuthor: u/arcticmonkeyzz\nScore: 0 | Comments: 5 | Upvote Ratio: 32.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 04:22:00\nContent: No offense to OP here but 6 months ago during the TSLA selloff I read a short thesis here. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/EsmTLxisl3\n\nStock price (especially something like TSLA) is wildly different from actual worth. I don't think shorts did very well 6 months back. In my opinion, and I'm just a SWE and not a financial guy, shorting further after 30-50% downturn just doesn't make sense at all. It was emotional. Shorts got rekt. \n\nPersonally I think TSLA is worth $1000 long term (and Tesla is poorly run for sure but it is still much more than just a car company), but $400-500 is just too much now. Musk has finished buying, and SPX has kept going up all while things don't make sense.

Citigroup, BOCI, UBS sitting at Buy. Not a bad setup imo. JPMorgan, SBI Securities, Gordian Capital, all picking up small positions this year. \n\nOn the press side, their partnership strategy actually diverse, NVIDIA, BOSCH, UBER, GRAB, etc. The market coverage is global too: Europe, SEA, UAE… I’m not even sure which countries they’ll target next, but honestly with how often they’re getting new government permits and all the news heating up lately, it feels like they’re aiming for a lot more.\n\nSo do you guys think now is the right time to jump in?

At current valuation, that roughly translates to an average return for investors. But maybe they all slightly **outperform** expectations and bring investors another 5-10 years of US equity outperformance too\n\nFast forward those 5-10 years. Here's my question to you... Was it worth the risk? It might not be obvious whether we're in an AI bubble right now. But what **is** obvious (at least to me) is that we've entered a moment in history where the market is experiencing **extreme correlation**\n\nWith each new announcement of this or that multi-billion dollar contract between tech companies, index funds are losing their diversification. Any prudent investor knows their goal is not to maximize total return but to optimize **risk-adjusted** returns. I'm just gonna say right now that these mega caps ain't it\n\nIf you truly want higher returns, the way to do it would be to leverage up a risk-adjusted optimal portfolio rather than hold highly concentrated positions in a few mega caps which have done amazingly well in recent years\n\nMy advice? For any random year, I'd say just go with VT to get global diversification. But in this current moment of extreme correlation, I'd say go with AVGE to get global diversification but with a value tilt which effectively underweights the US mega caps\n\nEdit: I will only be responding to relevant comments. Again, this post is **not** about whether the market will go up or down, but rather the tradeoff between future expected returns and recent increase in concentration risk.

Ill explain what it is then use CORZ as a case study of a company who will crush it in the next 5years. \n\nPer Gemini:\n\"A colocation center (often shortened to \"colo\") is a type of data center where a business leases physical space to house its own servers and other computing hardware\"\n\nSimply put, a colocation center houses the data infrastructure for large tech companies and the market size is expected to be $200Bn in 4-5years (in terms of generated revenue, and probably 50* when you consider PE ratios of the companies that will be the colocation centers in the future). The market cap of the companies housing the data infrastructure should be in low estimate of $10Tn.  \n\nYou might think NBIS and CRWV are colocation centers, but they are not, and they instead sell their consulting and operational services to big tech in exchange for managing and deploying the contracts for actual colocation centers (such as Equnix, Digital Reality, Cyprus one, and CORZ).  \n\nMarket research clearly shows the outsourcing on data storage centers away from big tech and towards colos. \n\nColos are necessary since they optimize energy use, control, host cosmic ray shielding, and are centered around major power supplies (which is why stocks like nuclear are taking off). The energy demands will be massive. \n\nCORZ are switching their entire business model towards colos and they are a relatively new, unheard of, and low market cap player in the space. They have plenty of experience hosting digital asset mining (which is where they generate the bulk of their revenue). \n\nCORZ presented at the last Web summit (the latest tech conference who have a strong focus in data instrastructure) and they blew away the big tech players with their energy efficiency models, rapidly changing business model.

In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2u4lm/stocks_you_own_with_products_you_actually_use/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Stocks you own with products you actually use\nAuthor: u/Throwra504guy\nScore: 71 | Comments: 116 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 15:09:23\nContent: Does anybody own stocks of companies with products that you also swear by?   Most of the evaluations I see are based on a variety of different criteria, and having a product that you actually love seems to be pretty far down the list. The best performing stock that I own, I got into because of a convincing testimonial from someone using their product and swearing that it was much better than all the competition.  I'm interested to hear from others if they have similar stocks like this.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o0vuae/amd_and_openai_a_raw_deal_for_amd/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: AMD and OpenAI - A raw deal for AMD\nAuthor: u/MrRikleman\nScore: 70 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 08:15:08\nContent: So, we've had a little time to digest this deal, what's it all about? \n\nLisa Su, in her infinite wisdom, [has granted OpenAI warrants](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm) to purchase up to 10% of AMD stock. The purchase price? One penny per share. Can you buy AMD stock at that price? I don't think you can. So why exactly is Sam Altman, hereafter referred to as Sammy, allowed to buy at this price? Read on.\n\nSammy is granted tranches of warrants to purchase AMD stock for one penny, subject to vesting standards. According to what has been disclosed so far, the first tranche vests after delivery of one gigawatt of GPUs. So Sammy has to buy this first batch before it gets any stock. But don't worry, Lisa has confidence Sammy will have the money to buy them (courtesy of Jensen et al.). Vesting of the remaining tranches of warrants are \"further subject to achievement of specified Company stock price targets that escalate to $600 per share for the final tranche and stock performance thresholds\". \n\nSo what's going on here? This looks like a vendor financing arrangement, not unlike NVDA's recently announced gift of cash to Sammy. Except instead of funding the gift to Sammy with cash, which Lisa doesn't have, she's funding it with stock, i.e. dilution of AMD shareholders. For the uninitiated, you are paying for this. So, Sammy gets free stock, which he's free to sell at any time. He doesn't make any money and he needs enormous amounts of cash to fund his chip purchases, so what would he do with this stock? Probably sell it yeah? And what on earth would he do with the money from the stock sales? I dunno, buy the AMD chips he promised to buy maybe? Who then paid for these chips that Sammy now has in his possession? If you're an AMD shareholder, you did, and you probably didn't benefit because you got diluted for it. Okay well how much money are we talking here? Sammy has warrants for 160 million of AMD stock, the final tra\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3iy4l/drawdowns_are_normal_and_expected/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Drawdowns are Normal and Expected\nAuthor: u/Marshall_Hoodie\nScore: 72 | Comments: 55 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 09:29:58\nContent: Saw a lot of chatter about the downturn in the market with the China tariff noise. As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward.\n\nWe tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. \n\nWe will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. \n\nSimilar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. \n\nThe downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. \n\nOf course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. \n\nAnd for the love of god, stop \n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient cash!
