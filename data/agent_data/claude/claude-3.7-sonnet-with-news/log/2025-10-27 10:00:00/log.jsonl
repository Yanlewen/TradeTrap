Currently trading at $186.27, down from buying price of $191.055.\n\n2. **MSFT**: Solid performer with strong cloud business. Current price $523.50 vs buying price $531.55.\n\n3. **GOOGL**: Trading at $259.91 vs buying price $265.28. Reddit sentiment suggests Google is undervalued with PE approaching 20. Strong search dominance, AI capabilities, and autonomous driving potential.\n\n4. **META**: At $738.51 vs buying price $755.37. Had a 16-day consecutive winning streak earlier in 2025, showing strong momentum.\n\n5. **Market Context**: According to Reddit discussions, international markets are actually outperforming US stocks in 2025 (MSCI ACWI ex USA +26% vs S&P 500 +15%), but tech concentration risk remains a concern.\n\n### Performance Analysis:\n\nAll current holdings are showing **unrealized losses** from their buying prices:\n- NVDA: -2.5%\n- MSFT: -1.5%\n- GOOGL: -2.0%\n- META: -2.3%\n\n### Strategic Decision:\n\nGiven the research findings and current market conditions:\n\n1. **Hold current positions**: All four stocks have strong long-term fundamentals despite short-term price weakness\n2. **Limited cash**: With only $60.31 in cash, we cannot make meaningful new purchases\n3. **Market sentiment**: Reddit discussions show strong belief in AI/tech long-term despite concerns about valuations\n4. **Diversification concern**: Portfolio is 100% concentrated in big tech, which Reddit discussions highlight as a risk\n\n**Action Plan**: I will **HOLD** all current positions. The small unrealized losses (-1.5% to -2.5%) don't warrant selling, especially given:\n- Strong long-term fundamentals for all holdings\n- Reddit sentiment remains bullish on these names\n- Insufficient cash to rebalance meaningfully\n- Selling at small losses would lock in losses unnecessarily\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
