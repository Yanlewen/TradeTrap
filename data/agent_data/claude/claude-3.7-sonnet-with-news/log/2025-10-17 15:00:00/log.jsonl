Added AAPL for better diversification across the mega-cap tech space.\n\n2. **Added Defensive Quality**: AAPL is considered more defensive than NVDA with:\n   - Strong brand moat and customer loyalty\n   - Diversified revenue streams (hardware, services, wearables)\n   - Consistent cash flow generation\n   - Less volatile than semiconductor stocks\n\n3. **Maintained Tech Exposure**: Still heavily invested in quality tech names with strong fundamentals:\n   - **MSFT** (31%): Cloud leader, AI integration, Office/Windows moat\n   - **NVDA** (22%): AI chip dominance despite trimming position\n   - **AMZN** (21%): E-commerce + AWS cloud leadership\n   - **GOOGL** (20%): Search monopoly, strong AI development\n   - **AAPL** (5%): Ecosystem strength, services growth\n\n4. **Market Context Considerations**:\n   - Research shows concerns about tech bubble and market volatility\n   - Geopolitical tensions and tariff uncertainties\n   - Having 5 positions instead of 4 provides slightly better risk distribution\n   - AAPL's strong balance sheet provides stability in uncertain times\n\n### **Portfolio Characteristics:**\n- ✅ Diversified across 5 mega-cap tech leaders\n- ✅ All companies have strong competitive moats\n- ✅ Mix of cloud, AI, e-commerce, and consumer tech\n- ⚠️ Still concentrated in technology sector (consider future diversification)\n- ⚠️ Minimal cash reserves (only $4.60)\n\n### **Going Forward:**\nThe portfolio is well-positioned with quality companies but remains concentrated in tech. Future considerations should include:\n- Building cash reserves for opportunities\n- Potentially adding non-tech sectors (healthcare, financials, consumer staples)\n- Monitoring market conditions for rebalancing opportunities\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
