Taking profits here.\n\n2. **AMD** - Sold 1 share @ $235.10 → Reduced from 1 to 0 shares\n   - *Rationale:* Semiconductor sector showing vulnerability. Better to consolidate into higher-quality holdings.\n\n**BUYS:**\n1. **GOOGL** - Bought 1 share @ $249.15 → Increased from 3 to 4 shares\n   - *Rationale:* More reasonable valuation than other mega-cap tech.

Trading at more attractive multiples than peers.\n\n2. **QCOM** - Bought 1 share @ $160.975 → Increased from 1 to 2 shares\n   - *Rationale:* Qualcomm offers exposure to mobile and AI edge computing at reasonable valuation. 5G tailwinds continue, and the stock is trading at more reasonable multiples than other semiconductor names.\n\n### **Updated Portfolio (Total Value: ~$4,972.04):**\n\n**Current Holdings:**\n- **NVDA**: 4 shares ($722.08) - 14.5% of portfolio\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares ($1,029.44) - 20.7% of portfolio  \n- **GOOGL**: 4 shares ($996.60) - 20.0% of portfolio\n- **AAPL**: 1 share ($248.97) - 5.0% of portfolio\n- **AMZN**: 2 shares ($429.66) - 8.6% of portfolio\n- **ISRG**: 1 share ($435.46) - 8.8% of portfolio\n- **LIN**: 1 share ($457.12) - 9.2% of portfolio\n- **QCOM**: 2 shares ($322.00) - 6.5% of portfolio\n- **PLTR**: 1 share ($180.10) - 3.6% of portfolio\n- **LRCX**: 1 share ($142.96) - 2.9% of portfolio\n- **CASH**: $7.65 - 0.2% of portfolio\n\n### **Key Strategic Changes:**\n\n✅ **Risk Reduction:** Eliminated extremely overvalued PLTR position (sold 50%)\n✅ **Quality Focus:** Added to GOOGL - better risk/reward than other mega-caps\n✅ **Diversification:** Increased QCOM for semiconductor exposure at reasonable valuation\n✅ **Cash Management:** Maintaining minimal cash (~0.2%) while staying fully invested in quality names\n\n### **Portfolio Characteristics:**\n- **Top 3 Holdings:** MSFT (20.7%), GOOGL (20.0%), NVDA (14.5%) = 55.2% of portfolio\n- **Sector Focus:** Technology-heavy with quality healthcare (ISRG) and industrials (LIN) for balance\n- **Valuation Profile:** Improved by reducing PLTR overexposure\n- **Risk Level:** Moderate - concentrated in mega-cap tech but diversified across leaders\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned with reduced exposure to extreme valuations while maintaining quality growth exposure through market leaders.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
