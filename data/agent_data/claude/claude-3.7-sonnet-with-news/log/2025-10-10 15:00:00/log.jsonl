I successfully executed the following trades:\n\n## Trades Executed on 2025-10-10:\n\n### SELL Orders:\n1. **Sold 1 PLTR @ $177.455** - Exited extremely overvalued position (P/S ratio of 100)\n2. **Sold 1 AAPL @ $246.00** - Reduced exposure due to product cycle concerns\n\n### BUY Orders:\n1. **Bought 2 AMD @ $218.85** - Added position following massive $100B+ OpenAI deal announcement\n\n### Updated Portfolio:\n- **NVDA**: 5 shares ($934.95)\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares ($1,029.08)\n- **AAPL**: 2 shares ($491.99)\n- **GOOGL**: 5 shares ($1,191.10)\n- **AMZN**: 4 shares ($873.06)\n- **AMD**: 2 shares ($437.70) - **NEW POSITION**\n- **CASH**: $5.53\n\n**New Total Portfolio Value: ~$4,963.41**\n\n## Rationale:\n\n1. **PLTR Exit**: Multiple analyses show it's the most overvalued large-cap stock in history with P/S of 100. While growth is strong (48%), the valuation is unsustainable and similar to Zoom's 2020 peak which crashed 90%.\n\n2. **AMD Entry**: Perfect timing on the $100B OpenAI deal. This is transformational for AMD and positions them as a serious NVDA competitor in AI chips. The stock already surged 24% but has significant runway given the deal size.\n\n3. **AAPL Trim**: Reduced exposure (not full exit) due to concerns about iPhone innovation stagnation and tariff headwinds mentioned in April 2025.\n\n4. **Maintained Core**: Kept strong positions in NVDA (AI leader), MSFT (enterprise/cloud), GOOGL (AI + search), and AMZN (cloud/retail).\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned for AI infrastructure growth with less valuation risk.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
