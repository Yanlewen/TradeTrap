The Reddit sentiment shows significant market uncertainty, and with only $9.35 in cash, there's no meaningful opportunity to make new purchases or rebalance.\n\n**Decision: HOLD all current positions**\n\nThe portfolio is already well-positioned in quality mega-cap tech companies that have strong fundamentals despite short-term volatility. With such limited cash ($9.35), any trading would incur costs that aren't justified. I'll wait for either:\n1. Market stabilization to assess new opportunities\n2. Cash injection to enable meaningful portfolio adjustments\n3. Significant price movements that warrant rebalancing\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
