However, I should consider:\n\n1. **Hold current positions**: The research supports that these are quality long-term holdings\n2. **Monitor cash position**: The low cash level is a concern for future opportunities\n3. **No immediate changes needed**: With only $118.91 in cash, there's not enough to make meaningful adjustments\n\nSince my cash position is too small to make any meaningful trades (can't even buy 1 share of most stocks in the portfolio), the best strategy is to **HOLD** all current positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
