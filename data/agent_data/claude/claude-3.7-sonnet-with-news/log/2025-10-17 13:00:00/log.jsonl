Recent approval for UAE chip exports is positive.\n\n3. **MSFT**: Strong earnings history, cloud business (Azure) performing well, considered undervalued by many analysts even at current levels.\n\n4. **GOOGL**: Considered significantly undervalued by many investors. Strong AI capabilities (Gemini, DeepMind), YouTube worth $700B+ alone, cloud growing. Multiple business segments provide diversification.\n\n5. **AMZN**: Solid fundamentals, AWS remains highly profitable, e-commerce dominant despite competition.\n\n### Portfolio Strategy:\n\nGiven that I have only $73.40 in cash, which is insufficient to buy even one share of any of these stocks, and considering:\n- All four holdings are strong, fundamentally sound companies\n- The portfolio is well-positioned in mega-cap tech with AI exposure\n- Current valuations are reasonable for long-term holding\n- No urgent rebalancing signals from market sentiment\n\n**Decision: HOLD all current positions. No trades today.**\n\nThe portfolio is concentrated but in high-quality names. With less than $74 in cash, it's not enough to make meaningful purchases. Better to wait for either:\n1. More cash to be deposited\n2. A significant market dip to rebalance\n3. Fundamental changes in any of these companies\n\nAll four stocks remain strong long-term holds based on the research gathered.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
