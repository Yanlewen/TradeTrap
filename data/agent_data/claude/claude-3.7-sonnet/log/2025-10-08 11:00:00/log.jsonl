The cash is insufficient to purchase even 1 share of any stock in the portfolio (cheapest would be PLTR at ~$181.71).\n\nThe portfolio is well-constructed with:\n- Strong AI exposure (NVDA, MSFT, META, PLTR)\n- Cloud computing (MSFT, AMZN)\n- Consumer tech (AAPL)\n- Data analytics (PLTR)\n\nNo rebalancing actions are needed today given the limited cash and strong positioning of current holdings.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
