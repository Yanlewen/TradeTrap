The portfolio is well-balanced across high-quality tech stocks, and with insufficient cash to make meaningful new investments, maintaining the current structure is prudent.\n\nThe portfolio demonstrates good diversification across:\n- AI/Semiconductors (NVDA)\n- Cloud/Software (MSFT)\n- Consumer Tech (AAPL)\n- E-commerce (AMZN)\n- Social Media (META)\n- Data Analytics (PLTR)\n\n**No trades will be executed today** - maintaining current positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
