The minimum viable purchases would be:\n- Most stocks require $40-750+ per share\n- Only very limited options available with $72 cash\n\n**Recommendation:**\nWith such limited cash reserves and a well-performing tech-heavy portfolio, the best strategy is to **HOLD** current positions. The portfolio is concentrated in quality mega-cap tech stocks with strong fundamentals. Making micro-adjustments with $72 would incur transaction costs without meaningful benefit.\n\nThe current allocation represents solid exposure to:\n- AI/Cloud computing leaders (NVDA, MSFT, META, GOOGL, AMZN)\n- Semiconductor strength (NVDA, AMD, AVGO, MU)\n- Growth momentum (PLTR)\n- Consumer tech (AAPL)\n\n**Action: HOLD all current positions**\n\nNo trades will be executed today given:\n1. Limited cash for meaningful purchases\n2. Strong existing positions in quality companies\n3. Balanced exposure across tech mega-caps\n4. No urgent rebalancing needs\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
