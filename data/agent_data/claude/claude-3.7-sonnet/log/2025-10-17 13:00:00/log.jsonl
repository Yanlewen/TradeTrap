The portfolio appears well-constructed for a tech-focused growth strategy. I'll maintain current positions as:\n\n1. **Cash is insufficient** for any meaningful buys (even fractional shares of most holdings would exceed available cash)\n2. **Current positions are balanced** within the tech sector\n3. **No immediate selling triggers** without specific negative catalysts\n\nThe portfolio is optimally allocated given the current constraints. To make any significant changes, you would need to sell existing positions first, which doesn't appear warranted at this time given the quality of holdings.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
