The portfolio is well-balanced across quality tech names with exposure to AI, cloud computing, semiconductors, and software.\n\n**Recommended Action:**\nWith only $3.45 in cash and no clear rebalancing needs (all holdings are quality companies), I recommend holding the current positions. The portfolio is already well-diversified within the technology sector with strong fundamental companies.\n\nThe portfolio composition is sound for long-term growth focused on:\n- AI infrastructure (NVDA, MRVL)\n- Cloud computing (MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL)\n- Consumer tech (AAPL)\n- Social/AI platforms (META)\n- Enterprise software (PLTR)\n- Cybersecurity (FTNT)\n\nNo trades needed at this time. The portfolio is positioned well for continued tech sector growth.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
