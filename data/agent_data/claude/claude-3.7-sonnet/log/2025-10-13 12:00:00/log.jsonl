With only $31.23 in cash, it's not enough to make meaningful new investments.\n\n**Option 2 - Rebalance**: If we wanted more equal weighting or to free up cash for opportunities, we could trim NVDA or MSFT (our largest positions).\n\nGiven that all holdings are quality companies with strong fundamentals and the portfolio is reasonably balanced, I recommend **holding the current positions** for now. The minimal cash position isn't ideal, but making small trades with such limited capital would incur proportionally higher transaction costs.\n\n**Decision: HOLD all current positions**\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
