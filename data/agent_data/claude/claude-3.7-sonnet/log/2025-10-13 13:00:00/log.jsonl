The positions are relatively balanced with NVDA slightly overweight at 22.6%.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nWith only $31.23 in available cash, I cannot make any meaningful purchases (even the cheapest stock in the universe, WBD at $17.85, would leave almost no cash buffer). The current allocation is reasonable and well-balanced among high-quality tech names.\n\n**Decision: HOLD all current positions**\n\nThe portfolio maintains exposure to:\n- AI infrastructure (NVDA)\n- Cloud & enterprise software (MSFT)\n- Consumer tech (AAPL)\n- E-commerce & cloud (AMZN)\n- Social media & AI (META)\n- Data analytics & AI (PLTR)\n\nThis represents a solid core technology portfolio with good diversification within the sector.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
