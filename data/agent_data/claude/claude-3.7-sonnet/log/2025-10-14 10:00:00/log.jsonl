The portfolio is well-constructed with exposure to:\n- AI/Semiconductors (NVDA)\n- Cloud/Enterprise Software (MSFT)\n- Consumer Tech (AAPL)\n- E-commerce/Cloud (AMZN)\n- Social Media/AI (META)\n- Data Analytics/AI (PLTR)\n\nAll positions show positive performance, and there's no pressing need to rebalance.
