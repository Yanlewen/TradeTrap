The current allocation appears reasonable for a tech-focused growth portfolio. I'll maintain the current positions as:\n\n1. All holdings are quality companies with strong fundamentals\n2. Insufficient cash to make meaningful new purchases\n3. No urgent need to reduce any positions based on current valuations\n4. The portfolio is well-positioned for continued tech sector growth\n\n**Decision: HOLD all current positions**\n\nThe portfolio is appropriately allocated given the available capital and current market conditions. No trades will be executed at this time.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
