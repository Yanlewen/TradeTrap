Let me look for opportunities to deploy this capital into high-conviction positions. Given the available cash, I can consider adding to existing positions or starting a new position in a promising stock.\n\nLooking at the portfolio, the strongest performers and AI-focused companies would be good candidates. Let me check if I can add exposure to key positions or enter new promising positions:\n\n**Analysis of opportunities with ~$72 capital:**\n\n1. **Small undervalued stocks** that could offer good returns\n2. **Add to existing positions** to increase exposure to winners\n\nGiven the constraints, I cannot afford most high-value stocks, but I notice several opportunities in the available universe. However, with only $72, options are limited. Let me maintain this as cash reserve for now, which provides flexibility for future opportunities.\n\nActually, looking at the available stocks, I notice some interesting opportunities in the lower price range that could provide good value. However, given that this is a fundamental analysis approach and we want to focus on quality companies with strong fundamentals, maintaining a small cash position (1.4% of portfolio) is prudent for:\n\n1. Portfolio rebalancing opportunities\n2. Taking advantage of market dips\n3. Transaction flexibility\n\n## Final Portfolio Update Summary:\n\n### Actions Taken:\n✅ **SOLD**: 1 share of PYPL at $70.83\n\n### Updated Portfolio:\n- **NVDA**: 4 shares ($764.38 - 14.5%)\n- **AAPL**: 3 shares ($797.58 - 15.1%)\n- **META**: 1 share ($751.02 - 14.2%)\n- **AMZN**: 3 shares ($683.04 - 12.9%)\n- **PLTR**: 3 shares ($572.27 - 10.8%)\n- **MSFT**: 1 share ($531.89 - 10.1%)\n- **AVGO**: 1 share ($360.94 - 6.8%)\n- **GOOGL**: 1 share ($268.18 - 5.1%)\n- **AMD**: 1 share ($255.77 - 4.8%)\n- **MU**: 1 share ($218.03 - 4.1%)\n- **CASH**: $72.35 (1.4%)\n\n### Total Portfolio Value: ~$5,275.45\n\n### Rationale:\n- Eliminated PYPL position due to underperformance and weak fundamentals relative to other holdings\n- Increased cash position to 1.4% for better flexibility\n- Portfolio remains focused on high-quality tech leaders with strong AI/semiconductor exposure\n- Well-positioned for continued growth in AI, cloud computing, and digital transformation trends\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
