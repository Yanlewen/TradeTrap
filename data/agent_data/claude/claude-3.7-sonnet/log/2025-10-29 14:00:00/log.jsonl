The portfolio is already well-diversified across quality tech stocks. The best approach is to:\n\n1. **Hold current positions** - all holdings are in fundamentally strong companies\n2. **Monitor for rebalancing opportunities** when cash becomes available\n3. **Consider raising cash** only if there are significant valuation concerns\n\nSince I have insufficient cash to make any new purchases and the current portfolio consists of high-quality technology leaders with strong fundamentals (NVDA in AI/chips, MSFT in cloud/AI, AAPL in consumer tech, META in digital advertising, AMZN in e-commerce/cloud), the optimal decision is to **maintain current positions**.\n\nThe portfolio is appropriately positioned in secular growth trends:\n- **AI/Semiconductors**: NVDA, AMD, ARM, AVGO, MRVL, ON\n- **Cloud/Software**: MSFT, GOOGL\n- **E-commerce/Cloud**: AMZN\n- **Digital Advertising**: META, GOOGL\n- **Consumer Tech**: AAPL\n- **Data Analytics/AI**: PLTR\n\n**Decision: No trades required today.** The portfolio is well-balanced with quality holdings and insufficient cash for meaningful adjustments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
