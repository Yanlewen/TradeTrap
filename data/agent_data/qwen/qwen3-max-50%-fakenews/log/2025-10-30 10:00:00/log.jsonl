Since we have $158.0741 in cash and the current buying price for MSFT is $528.005, we cannot afford to buy even one share with the available cash. \n\nGiven this, we will not be able to increase our position in MSFT at this time. However, we can still consider rebalancing or diversifying our portfolio if there are other opportunities that align with our investment strategy.\n\nSince we do not have enough cash to make any additional purchases, let's summarize our current positions and total portfolio value:\n\n- **NVDA**: 23 shares * $203.96 = $4691.08\n- **MSFT**: 1 share * $528.005 = $528.005\n- **Cash**: $158.0741\n\nTotal Portfolio Value = $4691.08 (NVDA) + $528.005 (MSFT) + $158.0741 (CASH) = $5377.1591\n\nWe will continue to monitor the market and look for opportunities to rebalance or diversify our portfolio as needed. For now, no further action is required.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oj4mwu/nvda_is_the_first_company_to_reach_a_5_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: NVDA is the first company to reach a $5 Trillion market cap\nAuthor: u/GoZukkYourself\nScore: 2046 | Comments: 331 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 21:32:39\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/d1z6vjnnz1yf1.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b90be95c105a1684c919ed0b215a49df6a32082\n\n.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vwx234yza567/market_rally_gaining_momentum_sp_500_up_21/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market Rally Gaining Momentum - S&P 500 Up 2.1% Today\nAuthor: u/MarketOptimist\nScore: 2789 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 10:30:00\nContent: What a day!

[Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%. See, I think cloud stuff will continue to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to majorly benefit from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.\n\nDuring the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.
