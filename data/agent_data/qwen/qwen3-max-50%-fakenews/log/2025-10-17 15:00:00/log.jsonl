For basically all of that time, I was essentially gambling. Buying cheap calls cus i saw some shit on reddit or twitter, then praying and hoping for 10x returns.  Lost money, made some back, lost it again. The usual retail trader shit. \n\nAbout 6 months ago I got tired of the guess flow and decided to actually learn the math behind options pricing. Slowly I began to build my strategy and with the help of AI I can confidently say that I am getting pretty profitable now. More importantly though, I finally feel like I have a decent understanding behind the options market. \n\nThis is a post I wish I had when I began my journey trading options, it mainly covers the strategy I currently employ but also covers some of the more basic concepts as well. Feel free to skip sections if you are more experienced. \n\n# 1. What is a volatility skew (and why does it exist)\n\nThink of options pricing like Vegas setting NBA Finals odds. Bookmakers start with expert predictions, then adjust the lines as the season progresses and bets roll in. Options work more or less in a similar manner: market makers use the Black-Scholes model as their baseline, then prices shift with market reality.\n\nHere's the key: **Black-Scholes assumes implied volatility should be constant across all strikes**. In theory, a far OTM call and an ATM call should have the same IV since they're on the same stock.\n\n**But reality disagrees.** OTM options consistently trade at higher IV than ATM options. Plot this and you get a volatility skew. I know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? After all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? And you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour.\n\n**Our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** When market makers overprice OTM options because everyone's panic\n================================================================================\n\n3853.0778999999998\n514.341\n507.9\n4367.4189\n564.8850000000001"}}
