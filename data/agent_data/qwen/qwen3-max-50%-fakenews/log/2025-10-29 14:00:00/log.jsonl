Additionally, we should consider whether to allocate more cash to either of these stocks or look for other opportunities in the market.\n\nSince we have a small amount of cash ($158.07), it might not be enough to make a significant purchase. However, if we decide to buy more shares, we can do so with the available cash.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific actions, such as buying more shares or holding the current positions? If not, I will conclude the analysis."}}

This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mno345pqr678/apple_m4_chip_gamechanger_for_computing/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple M4 Chip: Game-Changer for Computing - My Analysis\nAuthor: u/AppleAficionado\nScore: 2890 | Comments: 456 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 11:45:00\nContent: Apple just unveiled their revolutionary M4 chip powering the next-gen MacBook lineup.

With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-29.
