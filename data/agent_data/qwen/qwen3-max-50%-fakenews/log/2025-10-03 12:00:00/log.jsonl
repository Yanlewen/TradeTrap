However, we do have the current buying prices, which we can use to make a decision.\n\nLet's calculate how many shares we can buy with the available cash for each of the stocks (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN) and then decide on the best course of action. We will also consider the current portfolio value and the potential diversification benefits.\n\n### Available Cash: $76.93\n\n#### MSFT\n- Current Buying Price: $519.6921\n- Number of Shares We Can Buy: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{76.93}{519.6921} \\right\\rfloor = 0$ (Not enough cash to buy even one share)\n\n#### AAPL\n- Current Buying Price: $258.4131\n- Number of Shares We Can Buy: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{76.93}{258.4131} \\right\\rfloor = 0$ (Not enough cash to buy even one share)\n\n#### AMZN\n- Current Buying Price: $222.68\n- Number of Shares We Can Buy: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{76.93}{222.68} \\right\\rfloor = 0$ (Not enough cash to buy even one share)\n\nSince we don't have enough cash to buy even one share of any of these stocks, we should consider other options. One option is to hold the cash and wait for a better opportunity or to accumulate more cash before making a purchase.\n\nGiven the current situation, let's summarize the positions and the available cash:\n\n- **NVDA**: 25 shares\n- **GOOG**: 1 share\n- **CASH**: $76.93\n\nThe total portfolio value is approximately $5047.57.\n\nSince we cannot make a purchase with the available cash, we will hold the current positions and monitor the market for future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
