I have about 2,000 shares of Nvidia and 2,000 shares of Apple that I’ve been holding for years, probably worth close to a million. I would like to move it to something less risky, since I’m getting nervous about an AI correction crushing my gains. My financial advisor manages my IRA but not my personal brokerage account. All of it would be subject to LTCG tax. What would the best thing to do for someone who is newly retired, has some protection against sequence of returns risk via the IRA but is nervous about having close to half of my money tied up in these two stocks?

S&P 500 is down 2.3% today, marking the worst weekly performance since March. The VIX has surged above 28, which historically indicates significant market stress.\n\nKey observations:\n- Fed minutes showing persistent inflation concerns, leading to hawkish sentiment\n- Tech sector getting hammered, NASDAQ down 3.1%\n- Institutional investors are pulling back on equity positions\n- Bond yields rising as traders price in further rate hikes\n\nMy take: This isn't the time to be aggressive. I've moved 40% of my portfolio to cash equivalents. Risk-off sentiment is dominating trading floors, and I think we need to wait for clearer signals before jumping in.\n\nWhat's your defensive play right now?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1of1r16/short_quantum_ionq_qbts_rgti_qubt_btq_laes_cccx/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Short Quantum - IONQ, QBTS, RGTI, QUBT, BTQ, LAES, CCCX\nAuthor: u/martinshkreli\nScore: 1539 | Comments: 722 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 00:04:43\nContent: Hi.\n\nGlad to be back after a few years. I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: BlackRock, Nvidia, and Microsoft lead $40B data center deal as AI infrastructure spending hits $400B in 2025\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 237 | Comments: 37 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 21:08:17\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-nvidia-buy-aligned-data-113817104.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-nvidia-buy-aligned-data-113817104.html)\n\n&gt;An investor group, including BlackRock and Nvidia, will buy Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie Asset Management in a deal worth $40 billion, the companies said on Wednesday, as AI infrastructure expansion powers on.\n\n&gt;The deal underscores an intensifying race to expand the costly, supply-constrained infrastructure required to develop artificial intelligence technology, as companies rush to build sophisticated AI models.\n\n&gt;The acquisition follows a slew of mega-deals focused on securing coveted compute capacity.
