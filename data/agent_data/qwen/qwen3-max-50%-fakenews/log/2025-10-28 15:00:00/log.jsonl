This could be due to a lack of historical data or an issue with the data source.\n\nSince we don't have the specific price data, I will use the current buying prices provided to update the valuation and adjust the weights for each target.\n\n### Current Positions\n- **NVDA**: 23 shares\n- **MSFT**: 1 share\n- **CASH**: $158.07\n\n### Current Prices\n- **NVDA_price**: $199.985\n- **MSFT_price**: $545.1483\n\n### Valuation\n- **NVDA Value**: 23 * $199.985 = $4,599.655\n- **MSFT Value**: 1 * $545.1483 = $545.1483\n- **Total Value (excluding cash)**: $4,599.655 + $545.1483 = $5,144.8033\n- **Total Portfolio Value (including cash)**: $5,144.8033 + $158.07 = $5,302.8733\n\n### Weight Adjustment\n- **NVDA Weight**: ($4,599.655 / $5,302.8733) * 100 ≈ 86.74%\n- **MSFT Weight**: ($545.1483 / $5,302.8733) * 100 ≈ 10.28%\n- **Cash Weight**: ($158.07 / $5,302.8733) * 100 ≈ 2.98%\n\n### Decision\nGiven the positive sentiment and strong fundamentals, I will maintain the current positions in NVDA and MSFT. The portfolio is heavily weighted towards NVDA, which is aligned with the market's positive view on the company. The small position in MSFT and the cash balance provide some diversification and flexibility.\n\nIf there are any significant changes in the market or company-specific news, I will reassess the positions. For now, no further action is needed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vwx234yza567/market_rally_gaining_momentum_sp_500_up_21/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market Rally Gaining Momentum - S&P 500 Up 2.1% Today\nAuthor: u/MarketOptimist\nScore: 2789 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 10:30:00\nContent: What a day!
