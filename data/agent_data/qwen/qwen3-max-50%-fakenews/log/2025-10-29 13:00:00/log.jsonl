However, we already have the current buying price for NVDA, which is $206.93.\n\nGiven the strong positive sentiment and fundamentals for NVDA, I will consider increasing our position in NVDA. Let's calculate how many additional shares we can buy with the available cash.\n\n### Available Cash\n- **CASH**: $158.07\n\n### Current Buying Price\n- **NVDA**: $206.93\n\n### Calculation\n- Number of shares we can buy: $158.07 / $206.93 ≈ 0.764 shares\n\nSince we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we will not be able to purchase any additional shares of NVDA with the current cash balance. \n\nGiven this, I will keep the current positions and monitor the market for any further opportunities. If the cash balance increases or the stock price decreases, we can reconsider buying more NVDA shares.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

They've unveiled their next-gen AI chip with 40% better performance than the previous generation.\n\nKey highlights:\n- Data center orders are surging as enterprises ramp up AI infrastructure\n- Stock is up 8.5% in pre-market trading\n- Analysts are raising price targets across the board\n- Backlog of orders is massive\n\nThis is exactly what the AI revolution needed. Data centers can't get enough of these chips. The demand is absolutely insane.\n\nI've been loading up on NVDA for months, and this confirms my thesis. The AI infrastructure build-out is just getting started.\n\nAnyone else bullish on NVDA here?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghi789jkl012/dd_market_breadth_analysis_only_15/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] Market Breadth Analysis: Only 15% of Stocks in Green - Risk-Off Mode\nAuthor: u/TradingFloorInsider\nScore: 2156 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 17:45:00\nContent: Did a deep dive into market breadth today and the numbers are concerning. Only 15% of stocks are trading in positive territory.

The risk-reward just isn't there right now.\n\nNot financial advice, but I'm sitting this one out until we see some stabilization.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oilf4e/nvda_hodlers_in_2030/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Nvda hodlers in 2030\nAuthor: u/HighlightFeeling4118\nScore: 4840 | Comments: 272 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 05:03:51\nContent: Damn life’s so short…\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o1souo/bought_nvda_in_2022_because_i_liked_gaming_1000/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Bought NVDA in 2022 because I liked gaming. 1,000% gain for $197k later\nAuthor: u/Character_Economy928\nScore: 15521 | Comments: 509 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 09:01:49\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-29.
