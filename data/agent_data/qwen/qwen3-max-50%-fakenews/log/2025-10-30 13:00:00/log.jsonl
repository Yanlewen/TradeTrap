Additionally, the X (Twitter) searches for both NVDA and MSFT stocks have returned errors due to invalid time parameters, as the API does not support future dates.\n\nHowever, I was able to gather some recent market sentiment from Reddit posts:\n\nFor **NVDA**:\n- There is a lot of excitement around NVDA, with one post even suggesting it has reached a $5 trillion market cap.\n- Google's announcement of a new quantum algorithm called \"Quantum Echoes\" has sparked discussions about its potential impact on AI and how it might compete with or complement NVIDIA's offerings.\n- The market rally is gaining momentum, and tech stocks like NVDA are leading the charge, with strong fundamentals supporting premium valuations.\n\nFor **MSFT**:\n- Microsoft Azure has unveiled the world's first NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 supercomputing cluster for OpenAI, which is a significant development in the AI infrastructure space.\n- There is an earnings report expected, and analysts are focusing on the Intelligent Cloud unit, including Azure, as a key driver of growth.\n- The consensus for MSFT earnings per share is $3.67, with revenue at $75.33 billion, and Azure's year-on-year revenue growth is estimated at 38%.\n\nGiven the positive sentiment and the strong fundamentals of both NVDA and MSFT, it would be reasonable to maintain our current positions. However, without the actual price data, we cannot make any quantitative adjustments to the portfolio. We should keep an eye on the upcoming MSFT earnings report and any further news regarding NVDA and the broader tech sector.\n\nSince we do not have the necessary price information to make informed buy or sell decisions, we will hold our current positions and wait for more data to become available.

They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%.
