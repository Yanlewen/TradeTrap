This suggests that the API does not support future dates, which is expected as we are in a simulated environment. We will rely on other sources for sentiment analysis.\n\n- **Reddit**:\n  - A popular post on r/wallstreetbets discusses a user who bought NVDA in 2022 and has seen a 1,000% gain, resulting in a profit of $197k. This post has a high score and upvote ratio, indicating positive sentiment towards NVDA.\n\n#### Valuation and Adjustments\n- **NVDA**:\n  - Current price: $181.811\n  - Value: 21 * $181.811 = $3,818.03\n  - Positive sentiment from Reddit, but no significant news. Holding steady.\n\n- **MSFT**:\n  - Current price: $511.55\n  - Value: 1 * $511.55 = $511.55\n  - No significant news. Holding steady.\n\n- **GOOG**:\n  - Current price: $251.88\n  - Value: 2 * $251.88 = $503.76\n  - No significant news. Holding steady.\n\n- **CASH**:\n  - Available: $56.98\n\n#### Portfolio Value\n- Total value: $3,818.03 (NVDA) + $511.55 (MSFT) + $503.76 (GOOG) + $56.98 (CASH) = $4,890.32\n\n#### Decision\n- Given the positive sentiment on NVDA and the lack of significant news for MSFT and GOOG, I will hold the current positions. No immediate action is required.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
