This is a strong indicator of the company's growth and the continued demand for cloud services.\n  - There is a lot of discussion around the potential for Microsoft to benefit from the AI boom, particularly through its Azure cloud services.\n  - The broader economic indicators are also flashing green, with GDP growth, manufacturing PMI, and retail sales all showing positive trends. This macroeconomic environment is generally supportive of equities, including tech stocks like MSFT.\n\nGiven the positive news and market sentiment, it might be prudent to hold onto our current positions in NVDA and MSFT. However, without today's price data, we cannot make any quantitative adjustments to our portfolio. We should continue to monitor the situation and gather more information before making any trading decisions.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific actions or gather more information?"}}

[Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%.

The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.\n\nDuring the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.
