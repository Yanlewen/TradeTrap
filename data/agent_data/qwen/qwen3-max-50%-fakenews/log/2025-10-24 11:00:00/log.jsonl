We should monitor MSFT closely and consider whether to hold, sell, or adjust the position based on further analysis.\n- **Cash Position**: Given the current market volatility and the recommendation to take a defensive stance, it might be prudent to maintain a higher cash position to capitalize on potential buying opportunities if the market corrects further.\n\nLet's proceed with the following actions:\n- Hold the current position in NVDA.\n- Monitor MSFT and consider selling if the market continues to show signs of weakness.\n- Maintain a higher cash position to be ready for potential opportunities.\n\nWould you like to proceed with these actions, or do you have any other instructions?"}}

With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odhh7m/everyones_chasing_nvdabut_google_just_dropped_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Everyone’s chasing NVDA，but Google just dropped the biggest AI news of the year\nAuthor: u/FingerStunning7106\nScore: 706 | Comments: 156 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 03:09:57\nContent: So this one really caught my eye today.\n\nGoogle says it’s developed a new quantum algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” that apparently runs 13,000 times faster on their quantum chip than the most advanced classical algorithms on a supercomputer.\n\nIt’s not just some “look how cool our tech is” moment either.\n\nThey’re saying it could help map molecular structures for drug discovery and design new materials ，which, if true, would make this one of the first real-world quantum computing applications we’ve seen so far.\n\nI still remember when they announced the “Willow” chip last year, claiming it solved a key qubit issue.
