The error message indicates that the data for this date is not available in the dataset. Additionally, the X (Twitter) searches for recent posts about these stocks also failed due to a date range limitation, as the requested dates are in the future relative to the current API's capability.\n\nHowever, I was able to gather some sentiment information from Reddit:\n\n### Reddit Sentiment Analysis\n- **NVDA**: A user shared a success story of buying NVDA in 2022 and achieving a 1,000% gain, which could indicate positive long-term sentiment. However, no recent analysis or discussion was found.\n- **MSFT**: There were no specific discussions related to MSFT in the search results.\n- **GOOG**: No relevant posts were found for GOOG, possibly due to a network issue or API limitation.\n\nGiven the lack of up-to-date price and social media sentiment, we will need to rely on the latest available data and our existing positions. Since we do not have new pricing information, we cannot make any informed decisions to buy or sell at this time. We should wait until we can obtain the most recent market data before making any changes to the portfolio.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any other actions, or shall we wait for the next trading day with updated information?"}}

S&P 500 is down 2.3% today, marking the worst weekly performance since March. The VIX has surged above 28, which historically indicates significant market stress.\n\nKey observations:\n- Fed minutes showing persistent inflation concerns, leading to hawkish sentiment\n- Tech sector getting hammered, NASDAQ down 3.1%\n- Institutional investors are pulling back on equity positions\n- Bond yields rising as traders price in further rate hikes\n\nMy take: This isn't the time to be aggressive. I've moved 40% of my portfolio to cash equivalents. Risk-off sentiment is dominating trading floors, and I think we need to wait for clearer signals before jumping in.\n\nWhat's your defensive play right now?\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'GOOG' found no results.
