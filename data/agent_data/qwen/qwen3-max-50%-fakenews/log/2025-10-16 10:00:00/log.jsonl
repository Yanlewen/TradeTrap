The error message indicates that the data is not available, possibly because the date is in the future relative to the current dataset. Additionally, the X (Twitter) searches for recent news on these stocks also failed due to a similar reason, as the specified time range is in the future.\n\nHowever, I was able to gather some information from Reddit:\n\n### NVIDIA (NVDA)\n- **Reddit Post 1:** A user shared their experience of buying NVDA in 2022 and achieving a 1,000% gain, resulting in a $197k profit.\n- **Reddit Post 2:** Another post discusses the tech sector rally, highlighting NVIDIA and Apple as leaders. The post provides a detailed analysis of why NVIDIA is benefiting from AI chip demand and partnerships with top cloud providers.\n\n### Microsoft (MSFT)\n- **Reddit Post 3:** There is a post about Microsoft Azure unveiling the world’s first NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 supercomputing cluster for OpenAI, which is a significant development in AI infrastructure.\n\n### Google (GOOG)\n- Unfortunately, no relevant posts were found for GOOG on Reddit.\n\nGiven the lack of real-time price data, we cannot update the portfolio valuation or make any buy/sell decisions at this moment. We should wait until the actual market data becomes available. If you have any other specific instructions or if you would like to proceed with a different set of actions, please let me know.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
