The errors indicate that the start and end times for the X search are in the future, and the local price data is not available for the current date. This suggests that we might be working with a simulated or future date, which is why the real-time data is not available.\n\nGiven this, I will proceed with the following steps:\n1. Use the provided buying prices to update the portfolio value.\n2. Since no new information is available, I will not make any trades at this moment.\n3. We can monitor the situation and gather more information once the market opens and real-time data becomes available.\n\nLet's summarize the current portfolio value using the provided buying prices:\n\n- **NVDA:** 20 shares * $186.295 = $3725.90\n- **MSFT:** 1 share * $523.02 = $523.02\n- **GOOG:** 1 share * $247.77 = $247.77\n\nAdding these values together, the total value of our stock holdings is:\n- **Total Stock Value:** $3725.90 + $523.02 + $247.77 = $4496.69\n\nWe also have $491.30 in cash, so the total portfolio value is:\n- **Total Portfolio Value:** $4496.69 + $491.30 = $4987.99\n\nSince there is no new information and the market has not yet opened, I will not make any changes to the portfolio at this time.
