There was a notable post on r/wallstreetbets where an investor shared their success story, having gained 1,000% on NVDA since 2022, turning their investment into $197k.\n- **Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN)**: No specific news or significant Reddit posts were found for these stocks in the recent search.\n\nUnfortunately, the X (Twitter) search encountered an error due to invalid date parameters, which means we couldn't retrieve any tweets for today. However, based on the available information from Google Finance and Reddit, it seems that NVIDIA is currently performing well and has positive sentiment among investors.\n\n#### Current Portfolio Overview\n- **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: 21 shares\n- **Microsoft (MSFT)**: 1 share\n- **Google (GOOG)**: 2 shares\n- **Cash**: $56.99\n\nGiven the positive sentiment around NVIDIA and its current performance, I will not make any changes to our holdings in NVDA. For the other positions, there is no new information suggesting a need for adjustment. Therefore, I will maintain the current portfolio as is.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
