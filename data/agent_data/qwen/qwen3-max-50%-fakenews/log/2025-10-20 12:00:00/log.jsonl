Additionally, the X (Twitter) search API cannot process dates in the future, leading to errors in fetching recent posts.\n\nHowever, I was able to gather some information from Reddit:\n\nFor NVDA:\n- A user on r/wallstreetbets shared a personal success story of buying NVIDIA stock in 2022 and achieving a 1,000% gain, resulting in $197k. The post does not contain any text content, so it might be a link or image post.\n- Another post on r/stocks discusses Apple's M4 chip, but it seems to be unrelated to NVDA. This could be an error in the search results.\n\nFor MSFT:\n- There are no specific posts related to Microsoft (MSFT) in the provided Reddit search results. The posts found were about the general market downturn and economic outlook, which do not provide direct insights into Microsoft's stock performance.\n\nFor GOOG:\n- Unfortunately, the Reddit search for 'GOOG' did not return any results, possibly due to a network issue or API limitation.\n\nGiven the lack of relevant and actionable information, we will maintain our current positions without making any changes. We should continue to monitor the situation and look for more up-to-date and pertinent news as it becomes available. If you have any other instructions or if you would like me to perform additional searches, please let me know.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

This is a game-changer.\n\nSupply chain reports are showing:\n- Strong demand exceeding expectations\n- Production ramping up faster than projected\n- Services revenue hitting all-time highs\n\nThe M4 is not just an incremental upgrade - it's a leap forward. Early benchmarks show incredible performance.\n\nI've been tracking Apple's supply chain closely, and the indicators are all positive. Enterprise adoption is accelerating, and the services segment keeps growing.\n\nTech analysts are calling this a pivotal moment for computing. I agree. Apple is positioned perfectly for the next wave of enterprise adoption.\n\nPosition: Long AAPL. What are your thoughts?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o1souo/bought_nvda_in_2022_because_i_liked_gaming_1000/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Bought NVDA in 2022 because I liked gaming. 1,000% gain for $197k later\nAuthor: u/Character_Economy928\nScore: 15520 | Comments: 509 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 09:01:49\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o3dbm7/enjoy_the_weekend/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Enjoy the weekend\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 40217 | Comments: 1268 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:17:32\nContent: 🔴 Dow           -1.9%\n\n🔴 S&amp;P            -2.7%\n\n🔴 Russell      -3.0%\n\n🔴 Nasdaq     -3.6%\n\nEnjoy the weekend\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/def456ghi789/economic_outlook_global_markets_facing/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Economic Outlook: Global Markets Facing Headwinds - Stay Cautious\nAuthor: u/EconAnalyst\nScore: 892 | Comments: 178 | Upvote Ratio: 82.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 14:15:00\nContent: Wanted to share my analysis on the current economic situation. We're seeing headwinds from multiple directions:\n\n1. Geopolitical tensions increasing uncertainty\n2. Slowing growth indicators from major economies\n3. Central banks maintaining hawkish stances\n\nInstitutional money is flowing out of equities. The smart money is sitting on cash right now. \"Cash is king\" sentiment is emerging among portfolio managers I've spoken with.\n\nVIX above 28 + negative market breadth (only 15% stocks in green) = time to be defensive, not aggressive.\n\nI'm recommending:\n- Reduce equity exposure\n- Increase cash positions\n- Focus on defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples)\n- Wait for volatility to subside\n\nAnyone else seeing similar patterns?\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'GOOG' found no results.
