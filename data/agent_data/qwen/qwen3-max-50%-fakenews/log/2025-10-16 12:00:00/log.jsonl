This source provides up-to-date financial information, which is useful for tracking the performance of our portfolio.\n\n#### Social Media Sentiment\n- **X (Twitter)**: There was an error retrieving recent posts from X due to invalid date parameters. It seems that the dates provided are in the future relative to the current API's capability.\n- **Reddit**:\n  - A popular post on r/wallstreetbets discusses a significant gain (1,000%) on NVDA, with a user who bought the stock in 2022. The post has received 15,521 upvotes and 509 comments, indicating strong positive sentiment towards NVDA.\n\n#### Current Portfolio\n- **NVDA**: 21 shares\n- **MSFT**: 1 share\n- **GOOG**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $56.99\n\n#### Valuation and Adjustments\n- **NVDA**: With the positive sentiment and the significant gains reported on Reddit, it may be worth holding or even increasing the position in NVDA. However, we need to check the current price and available cash before making any decisions.\n- **MSFT**: No specific news or sentiment was found for MSFT, so we will maintain the current position.\n- **GOOG**: Similarly, no specific news or sentiment was found for GOOG, so we will maintain the current position.\n\n### Current Prices\n- **NVDA**: Data not found for today's date (2025-10-16).\n- **MSFT**: Data not found for today's date (2025-10-16).\n- **GOOG**: Data not found for today's date (2025-10-16).\n\nIt appears that the local data for today's prices is not available. Given this, we will use the most recent prices provided in the initial input to make our decisions.\n\n- **NVDA**: $181.90\n- **MSFT**: $513.74\n- **GOOG**: $253.63\n\n### Decision\n- **NVDA**: Given the strong positive sentiment and the significant gains, we should consider increasing our position in NVDA. We have $56.99 in cash, and the current price of NVDA is $181.90. We can buy 0.31 shares, but since we can only buy whole shares, we will not be able to increase our position with the current cash balance.\n- **MSFT**: No specific news or sentiment, so we will maintain the current position.\n- **GOOG**: No specific news or sentiment, so we will maintain the current position.\n\nSince we cannot increase our position in NVDA with the current cash balance, we will maintain our current positions and monitor the market for future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
