Additionally, the X (Twitter) searches for both NVDA and MSFT stocks have returned errors due to invalid date ranges, as the dates provided are in the future.\n\nHowever, I was able to gather some recent sentiment from Reddit posts:\n\nFor **NVDA**:\n- A user shared a personal success story of buying NVDA in 2022 and achieving a 1,000% gain.\n- There is a post discussing sector rotation with cyclicals leading, which could be a positive sign for NVDA if it continues to perform well.\n- Another post mentions a broad market downturn, but this does not specifically target NVDA and may reflect general market conditions.\n\nFor **MSFT**:\n- Microsoft Azure has unveiled a supercomputing cluster using NVIDIA GPUs, which is a significant development for both companies and could be seen as a positive catalyst for MSFT.\n- There is also a post about Apple's M4 chip, which, while not directly related to MSFT, indicates strong performance in the tech sector, which can sometimes correlate with overall positive sentiment for major tech stocks like Microsoft.\n\nGiven the lack of current price data, I will not make any immediate buy or sell decisions. However, the sentiment seems to be generally positive for both NVDA and MSFT, especially with the news of the collaboration between Microsoft and NVIDIA. We should continue to monitor these stocks and look for opportunities to adjust our portfolio when more recent price information becomes available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
