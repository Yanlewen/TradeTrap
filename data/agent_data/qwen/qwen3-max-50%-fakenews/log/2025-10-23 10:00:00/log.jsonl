This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vwx234yza567/market_rally_gaining_momentum_sp_500_up_21/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market Rally Gaining Momentum - S&P 500 Up 2.1% Today\nAuthor: u/MarketOptimist\nScore: 2789 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 10:30:00\nContent: What a day!
