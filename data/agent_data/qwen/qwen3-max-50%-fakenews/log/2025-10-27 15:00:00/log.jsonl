However, we can still proceed with the analysis based on the latest market sentiment and news.\n\nFrom the Reddit posts, it seems like both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are in a positive light:\n\n- **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: There's strong demand for AI chips, and NVIDIA is at the forefront of this trend. The company has a significant order backlog, and its partnerships with top cloud providers are driving growth. Additionally, NVIDIA's collaboration with Microsoft Azure to deploy supercomputing clusters for OpenAI indicates a robust future outlook.\n  \n- **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Microsoft is also benefiting from the AI boom, as evidenced by the partnership with NVIDIA and the deployment of large-scale GPU clusters for AI workloads. However, one user mentioned selling their MSFT holdings to invest more in Amazon (AMZN), suggesting some investors may be rotating out of MSFT into other tech stocks.\n\nUnfortunately, the X (Twitter) search did not return any results due to an invalid date range, but the Reddit posts provide a good indication of the current market sentiment.\n\nGiven the positive sentiment around both NVDA and MSFT, and without specific price data, I will maintain the current positions.
