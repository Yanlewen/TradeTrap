This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jkl012mno345/breaking_nvidia_announces_breakthrough_ai/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: [BREAKING] NVIDIA Announces Breakthrough AI Chip - 40% Performance Gain\nAuthor: u/TechInvestor_AI\nScore: 3421 | Comments: 523 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 09:20:00\nContent: Just saw NVIDIA's announcement and this is huge.

Data centers can't get enough of these chips. The demand is absolutely insane.\n\nI've been loading up on NVDA for months, and this confirms my thesis. The AI infrastructure build-out is just getting started.\n\nAnyone else bullish on NVDA here?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o1souo/bought_nvda_in_2022_because_i_liked_gaming_1000/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Bought NVDA in 2022 because I liked gaming. 1,000% gain for $197k later\nAuthor: u/Character_Economy928\nScore: 15519 | Comments: 509 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 09:01:49\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghi789jkl012/dd_market_breadth_analysis_only_15/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] Market Breadth Analysis: Only 15% of Stocks in Green - Risk-Off Mode\nAuthor: u/TradingFloorInsider\nScore: 2156 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 17:45:00\nContent: Did a deep dive into market breadth today and the numbers are concerning.
