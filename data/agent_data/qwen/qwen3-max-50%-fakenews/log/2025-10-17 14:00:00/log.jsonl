This might be because the dates provided are in the future, which is not supported by the API. We will proceed without this information for now.\n\n#### Reddit\n- A popular post on r/wallstreetbets discusses a significant gain (1,000%) from buying NVIDIA (NVDA) in 2022, resulting in a profit of $197k. This indicates strong positive sentiment towards NVDA among retail investors.\n\n### Valuation and Strategy Adjustment\n\nGiven the current market sentiment and the lack of negative news, I will maintain our positions in NVDA, MSFT, and GOOG. However, we should keep an eye on any new developments that may affect these stocks. \n\nLet's calculate the current value of our portfolio based on today's prices:\n\n- **NVDA** (21 shares * $182.8551) = $3,839.96\n- **MSFT** (1 share * $513.15) = $513.15\n- **GOOG** (2 shares * $253.66) = $507.32\n- **CASH** = $56.98\n\nTotal Portfolio Value: $3,839.96 + $513.15 + $507.32 + $56.98 = $4,917.41\n\nSince there are no immediate signals to buy or sell, we will hold our current positions. If you have any specific instructions or if you want to adjust the strategy, please let me know.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
