Instead, I will manually calculate the number of shares we can buy with the available cash.\n\nThe current price of GOOG is $279.905, and the available cash is $114.77. Since the cash is not sufficient to buy even one share of GOOG, we cannot increase our position in GOOG at this time.\n\nGiven that we cannot make any additional purchases with the current cash balance, and considering the strong positions in NVDA and GOOG, I will maintain the current portfolio without making any changes today.\n\nTo summarize:\n- **NVDA**: 23 shares\n- **GOOG**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $114.77\n\nTotal Portfolio Value: $5361.06\n\nI will continue to monitor the market and news for any further developments that may impact our positions.

This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vwx234yza567/market_rally_gaining_momentum_sp_500_up_21/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market Rally Gaining Momentum - S&P 500 Up 2.1% Today\nAuthor: u/MarketOptimist\nScore: 2789 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 10:30:00\nContent: What a day! S&P 500 up 2.1% as positive economic data pours in. This feels like a real rally, not just a dead cat bounce.\n\nPositive catalysts:\n- Jobless claims hit 18-month low\n- Consumer confidence rising\n- Fed hinting at potential policy pivot\n- Bullish sentiment returning to Wall Street\n\nThe economic indicators are finally flashing green. We're seeing:\n- GDP growth revised upward\n- Manufacturing PMI beating expectations\n- Retail sales surging\n- Inflation cooling faster than projected\n\nMarkets are pricing in a soft landing scenario. Risk assets are rallying across the board.\n\nI've been increasing my equity allocation. This looks like the beginning of a sustained move higher.\n\nAnyone else feeling bullish here?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wildcard/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Universal Fake Reddit Post: Market Outlook Discussion\nAuthor: u/wildcard_redditor\nScore: 500 | Comments: 100 | Upvote Ratio: 85.0%\nCreated: 2025-01-01 00:00:00\nContent: This is a universal fake Reddit post that can match any date for testing purposes.
