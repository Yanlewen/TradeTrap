This could be due to the fact that the date is in the future, and the data has not yet been recorded.\n\nGiven this, I will rely on the current prices provided and the sentiment analysis from Reddit to make a decision. \n\n### Current Prices\n- **NVDA**: $187.505\n- **MSFT**: $514.3488\n- **AMZN**: $218.27\n- **GOOG**: $238.16\n\n### Sentiment Analysis\n- **NVDA**: Strong positive sentiment with a significant gain reported on Reddit.\n- **MSFT, AMZN, GOOG**: No specific recent news or sentiment was found, but these are generally stable and well-performing stocks.\n\n### Decision\n- **Hold NVDA**: Given the strong positive sentiment and the significant gains reported, it makes sense to hold our position in NVDA.\n- **Hold MSFT, AMZN, GOOG**: These are stable and well-performing stocks, and we should continue to hold them.\n- **Cash Position**: We have a small amount of cash ($25.655), which is not enough to make a meaningful purchase at this time.\n\nSince there is no new information that suggests a change in strategy, and the current positions are performing well, I will maintain the current portfolio without making any trades today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
