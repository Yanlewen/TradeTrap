It seems to be a general stock price comparison page without any significant news.\n  \n- **X (Twitter)**: There was an error in fetching tweets due to invalid date parameters. This means we couldn't get the latest tweets for the specified stocks.\n\n- **Reddit**:\n  - A post on r/wallstreetbets by u/Character_Economy928 shared their experience of buying NVDA in 2022, resulting in a 1,000% gain, amounting to $197k. The post has received 15,522 upvotes and 509 comments, with a 96% upvote ratio. This indicates strong positive sentiment towards NVDA among the Reddit community.\n\n### Portfolio Update\n\nGiven the positive sentiment around NVDA and the lack of negative news, I will maintain our current positions. However, I will also check the current prices and valuations to ensure that no adjustments are needed.\n\nLet's proceed to update the portfolio based on today's prices."}}
