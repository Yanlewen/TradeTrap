However, there was an error with the X (Twitter) search due to invalid date parameters, as it seems we cannot fetch data from future dates. The Reddit search, however, provided a relevant post about NVDA.\n\nFrom the Reddit post, it appears that there is positive sentiment around NVIDIA (NVDA), with a user sharing their success story of a 1000% gain since 2022. This could be indicative of strong market sentiment towards the stock, but we should also consider other factors before making any trading decisions.\n\nLet's now calculate the current value of our portfolio based on the positions and today's prices, and then decide if we need to make any adjustments."}}
