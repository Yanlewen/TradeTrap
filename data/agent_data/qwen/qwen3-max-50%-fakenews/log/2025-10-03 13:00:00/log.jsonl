We only have $76.93 available, which is not enough to purchase a single share of AMZN.\n\nGiven the limited cash and the strong performance of our current holdings (NVDA and GOOG), it might be best to hold our current positions and wait for more cash to become available or for a better opportunity to diversify.\n\n### Summary\n- **Current Holdings**:\n  - **NVDA**: 25 shares\n  - **GOOG**: 1 share\n  - **CASH**: $76.93\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5023.47\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Monitor the market**: Keep an eye on the performance of NVDA and GOOG.\n- **Accumulate cash**: Wait for more cash to become available through potential future gains or additional funding.\n- **Re-evaluate opportunities**: Consider diversification when we have more cash available.\n\nFor now, we will hold our current positions and continue to monitor the market. If there are any significant changes or new opportunities, we can re-evaluate our strategy.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
