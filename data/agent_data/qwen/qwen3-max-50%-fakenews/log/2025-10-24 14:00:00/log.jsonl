This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 195 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI. As Azure scales to its goal of deploying hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs, even more innovations are poised to emerge from customers like OpenAI.\"\n\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-azure-delivers-the-first-large-scale-cluster-with-nvidia-gb300-nvl72-for-openai-workloads/\n\n\"Microsoft delivers the first at-scale production cluster with more than 4,600 NVIDIA GB300 NVL72, featuring NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs connected through the next-generation NVIDIA InfiniBand network. This cluster is the first of many, as we scale to hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs deployed across Microsoft’s AI datacenters globally, reflecting our continued commitment to redefining AI infrastructure and collaboration with NVIDIA. The massive scale clusters with Blackwell Ultra GPUs will enable model training in weeks instead of months, delivering high throughput for inference workloads.\"\n\n\"This co-engineered system delivers the world’s first at-scale GB300 production cluster, providing the supercomputing engine needed for OpenAI to serve multitrillion-parameter models.
