Only 15% of stocks are trading in positive territory. This level of negativity hasn't been seen since March.\n\nSector rotation is clearly favoring defensive plays:\n- Utilities up 0.8%\n- Consumer Staples up 0.5%\n- REITs down only 0.3%\n\nMeanwhile:\n- Tech down 3.1%\n- Growth stocks getting crushed\n- High-beta names underperforming\n\nThe traders I know on the floor are all saying the same thing: wait for clearer signals before aggressive positioning. The risk-reward just isn't there right now.\n\nNot financial advice, but I'm sitting this one out until we see some stabilization.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o7prtk/my_method_on_making_money_trading_mispriced/\nSubreddit: r/options\nTitle: My method on making money trading mispriced options with AI\nAuthor: u/PandaMcGee3\nScore: 1714 | Comments: 114 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 06:50:13\nContent: TLDR: Find stocks with abnormal volatility skews using AI, then trade Vertical Spreads on them depending on the direction. \n\nI've been trading options for about 3 years now. For basically all of that time, I was essentially gambling. Buying cheap calls cus i saw some shit on reddit or twitter, then praying and hoping for 10x returns.  Lost money, made some back, lost it again. The usual retail trader shit. \n\nAbout 6 months ago I got tired of the guess flow and decided to actually learn the math behind options pricing. Slowly I began to build my strategy and with the help of AI I can confidently say that I am getting pretty profitable now. More importantly though, I finally feel like I have a decent understanding behind the options market. \n\nThis is a post I wish I had when I began my journey trading options, it mainly covers the strategy I currently employ but also covers some of the more basic concepts as well. Feel free to skip sections if you are more experienced. \n\n# 1. What is a volatility skew (and why does it exist)\n\nThink of options pricing like Vegas setting NBA Finals odds. Bookmakers start with expert predictions, then adjust the lines as the season progresses and bets roll in. Options work more or less in a similar manner: market makers use the Black-Scholes model as their baseline, then prices shift with market reality.\n\nHere's the key: **Black-Scholes assumes implied volatility should be constant across all strikes**. In theory, a far OTM call and an ATM call should have the same IV since they're on the same stock.\n\n**But reality disagrees.** OTM options consistently trade at higher IV than ATM options. Plot this and you get a volatility skew. I know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? After all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? And you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour.\n\n**Our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** When market makers overprice OTM options because everyone's panic\n================================================================================\n\n3824.3100000000004\n511.05\n505.26"}}

This suggests that NVIDIA's position in the AI world remains strong, and there are no immediate negative implications for our holding.\n\n2. **Market Breadth Analysis (Reddit - r/wallstreetbets)**: A post on r/wallstreetbets indicates that only 15% of stocks are trading in positive territory, which is a concerning sign. Defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples are outperforming, while tech and growth stocks are underperforming. This suggests a risk-off environment, and traders are advising to wait for clearer signals before making aggressive moves.\n\n3. **Options Trading Strategy (Reddit - r/options)**: A post on r/options discusses a strategy for trading mispriced options using AI. While this is interesting, it does not directly impact our current holdings, but it may be worth considering if we decide to diversify into options in the future.\n\nGiven the current market conditions and the risk-off sentiment, it might be prudent to hold our positions and monitor the situation. However, if you would like to make any specific adjustments, such as selling some of our positions or buying into defensive stocks, please let me know.\n\nFor now, I will maintain the current positions and continue to monitor the market.
