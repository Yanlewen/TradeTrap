However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $257.60\n- **MSFT** opened at $524.42\n\nGiven that we currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 14 * 257.60 = $3,606.40\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * 524.42 = $1,048.84\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is therefore $3,606.40 + $1,048.84 = $4,655.24. Adding the available cash of $365.83, the total portfolio value is $5,021.07.\n\nSince no specific strategy has been outlined for adjusting weights or making trades, and without additional information from the news, I will not make any changes to the portfolio at this time. If you have a particular strategy in mind or if you would like me to suggest one, please let me know. Otherwise, we can continue to monitor the positions as they are.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
