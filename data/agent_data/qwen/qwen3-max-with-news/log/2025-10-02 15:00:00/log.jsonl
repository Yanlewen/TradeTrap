However, I have successfully fetched the OHLCV data for AAPL as of 2025-10-02 15:00:00. Here is the information:\n\n- **Symbol:** AAPL\n- **Date & Time:** 2025-10-02 15:00:00\n- **Open Price:** $257.93\n\nUnfortunately, the high, low, close, and volume data are not available at this time.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 19 shares of AAPL, let's evaluate if any action is needed based on the current open price and our overall strategy. Since no specific strategy has been outlined, I will assume a general approach of holding onto profitable positions unless there is a significant change in the stock's fundamentals or market conditions.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific actions, or shall we continue to hold the current position?\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
