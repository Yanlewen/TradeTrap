The news suggests that Apple and Meta are close to settling antitrust cases, which could be positive for Apple. Additionally, there are no significant negative factors affecting our current positions.\n\nSince the portfolio is well-diversified with a mix of tech stocks and cash, and there are no immediate red flags from the news, we can maintain the current positions. However, we should keep an eye on the developments and be ready to make adjustments if needed.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Current Positions**:\n  - **AAPL**: 14 shares\n  - **MSFT**: 2 shares\n  - **CASH**: $365.83\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5023.33\n\nNo immediate action is required, but we will continue to monitor the market and news for any significant changes.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
