However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $271.44.\n- **MSFT** opened at $516.59.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * $271.44 = $2714.40\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $516.59 = $1033.18\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is $2714.40 + $1033.18 = $3747.58. Adding this to our available cash of $1391.07, the total portfolio value is $5138.65.\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy or new information to act upon, we will maintain our current positions. If you have any specific instructions or if you would like to adjust the portfolio, please let me know. Otherwise, we will continue to monitor the market and make adjustments as necessary. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
