However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $260.20.\n- **MSFT** opened at $523.02.\n\nGiven our current positions:\n- 10 shares of **AAPL**, valued at $260.20 per share, totaling $2,602.00.\n- 2 shares of **MSFT**, valued at $523.02 per share, totaling $1,046.04.\n\nOur total portfolio value in stocks is $3,648.04, plus the available cash of $1,391.07, making a grand total of $5,039.11.\n\nWithout the latest news and analysis, we will base our decision on the current valuations and market trends. Given that the stock market can be volatile, it's important to keep a balanced and diversified portfolio. Since we only hold two types of stocks, let's consider if any adjustments are necessary based on their performance and our overall strategy.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific actions, or shall we maintain the current positions? If no specific instructions, I'll conclude the task here.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
