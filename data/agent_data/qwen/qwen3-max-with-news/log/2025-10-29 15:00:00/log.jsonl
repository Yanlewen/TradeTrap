Given the lack of new information, we will base our decision on the current portfolio value and the opening prices.\n\nOur current holdings:\n- 10 shares of **AAPL** valued at 2695.3\n- 2 shares of **MSFT** valued at 1077.78\n- Available cash: 1391.07\n\nTotal portfolio value: 5164.15\n\nSince we do not have any new information or signals to act upon, and the market is already open (it's 15:00), it might be prudent to hold our current positions and monitor the situation. We can reassess our strategy after the market closes or when more information becomes available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
