However, I have successfully retrieved the OHLCV data for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL**:\n  - Open: $266.235\n  - High: Not available yet\n  - Low: Not available yet\n  - Close: Not available yet\n  - Volume: Not available yet\n\n- **MSFT**:\n  - Open: $533.52\n  - High: Not available yet\n  - Low: Not available yet\n  - Close: Not available yet\n  - Volume: Not available yet\n\nSince we don't have the full day's OHLCV data, let's proceed with the information we have. We will use the opening prices to update our portfolio valuation.\n\n### Current Positions:\n- **AAPL**: 10 shares\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $1391.07\n\n### Updated Valuation:\n- **AAPL Value**: 10 * $266.235 = $2662.35\n- **MSFT Value**: 2 * $533.52 = $1067.04\n- **Total Stock Value**: $2662.35 + $1067.04 = $3729.39\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $3729.39 + $1391.07 = $5120.46\n\nGiven the current positions and the updated valuation, no immediate action is required unless there are specific strategies or targets you want to implement. \n\nWould you like to make any adjustments to the portfolio, or should we continue monitoring the market?\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
