However, I have successfully retrieved the OHLCV data for today's date (2025-10-30 13:00:00) for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\nFor **AAPL**:\n- Open: $271.31\n- High, Low, Close, and Volume are not available at this time.\n\nFor **MSFT**:\n- Open: $526.16\n- High, Low, Close, and Volume are not available at this time.\n\nGiven that we do not have complete OHLCV data and the latest news, let's proceed with what we have. We will use the opening prices to update our portfolio valuation.\n\n### Current Positions\n- **AAPL**: 10 shares\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $1391.07\n\n### Updated Valuation\n- **AAPL** value: 10 * $271.31 = $2713.10\n- **MSFT** value: 2 * $526.16 = $1052.32\n- **Total Value**: $2713.10 + $1052.32 + $1391.07 = $5156.49\n\nSince we don't have any new information or signals to adjust our positions, we will maintain the current holdings. If you would like to make any changes or if there is additional information you need, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
