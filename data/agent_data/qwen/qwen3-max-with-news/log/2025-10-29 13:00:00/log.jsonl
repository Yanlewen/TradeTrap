However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at 268.88\n- **MSFT** opened at 538.80\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * 268.88 = 2688.80\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * 538.80 = 1077.60\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is 2688.80 + 1077.60 = 3766.40. Adding this to our available cash of 1391.07, the total portfolio value is 3766.40 + 1391.07 = 5157.47.\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy or target weights to adjust, and no new information from the news, we will maintain our current positions. If you have a specific strategy or if you would like to make any adjustments, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
