Given that we have a cash balance of approximately $144.93, it's not sufficient to buy even one additional share at the current price.\n\nSince we don't have enough cash to make a new purchase and there are no significant negative news items affecting AAPL, we will maintain our current position of 19 shares of AAPL and the available cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
