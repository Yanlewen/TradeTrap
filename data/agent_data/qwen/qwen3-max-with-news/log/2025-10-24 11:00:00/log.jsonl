However, I have successfully retrieved the OHLCV data for both AAPL and MSFT for today's date, 2025-10-24 at 11:00:00.\n\nFor **AAPL**:\n- Open: $261.85\n- High, Low, Close, and Volume are not available as of now since the market is still open.\n\nFor **MSFT**:\n- Open: $523.01\n- Similarly, High, Low, Close, and Volume are not available yet.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on the opening prices:\n\n- Value of AAPL holdings: 10 * $261.85 = $2618.50\n- Value of MSFT holdings: 2 * $523.01 = $1046.02\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings, therefore, is $2618.50 + $1046.02 = $3664.52. Adding this to our available cash of $1391.07, the total portfolio value stands at $5055.59.\n\nWithout the latest news affecting our decision, and considering the current positions and prices, no immediate action seems necessary. We will continue to monitor the situation. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
