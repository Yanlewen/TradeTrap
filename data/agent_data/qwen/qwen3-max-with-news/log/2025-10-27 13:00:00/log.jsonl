However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $265.59\n- **MSFT** opened at $531.35\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * $265.59 = $2655.90\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $531.35 = $1062.70\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is thus $2655.90 + $1062.70 = $3718.60. Adding this to our available cash of $1391.07, the total portfolio value stands at $5109.67.\n\nWithout the latest news and analysis, it's challenging to make a fully informed decision. However, based on the current information, no immediate action seems necessary unless there are specific targets or thresholds you're aiming for. Would you like to proceed with any particular actions, or shall we maintain the current positions?\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
