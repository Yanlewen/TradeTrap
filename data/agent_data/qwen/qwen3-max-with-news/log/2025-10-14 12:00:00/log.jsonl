Our holdings are currently valued at $4,851.55, with a significant portion in AAPL and MSFT.\n\nGiven the lack of new information, I do not see an immediate need to adjust our positions. However, if you have any specific instructions or if you would like to rebalance the portfolio, please let me know. Otherwise, we can maintain our current positions and monitor the market for any changes.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
