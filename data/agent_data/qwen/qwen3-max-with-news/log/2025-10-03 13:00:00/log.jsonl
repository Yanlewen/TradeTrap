However, I have successfully fetched the OHLCV data for AAPL as of 2025-10-03 13:00:00.\n\nHere's the information:\n- **Symbol:** AAPL\n- **Date & Time:** 2025-10-03 13:00:00\n- **Open Price:** $258.81\n\nUnfortunately, the high, low, close, and volume data are not available at this moment. \n\nGiven that we currently hold 19 shares of AAPL, let's proceed with a fundamental analysis based on the available open price and any other relevant factors before deciding on our next move. Since we don't have the latest news, we will base our decision primarily on the current market price and our investment strategy.\n\nWould you like to buy more, sell, or hold the current position? If you have a specific strategy or additional information, please provide it. Otherwise, I will suggest a course of action based on the current situation.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
