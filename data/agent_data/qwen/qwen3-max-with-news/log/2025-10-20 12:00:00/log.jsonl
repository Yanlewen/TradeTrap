Given this, we will proceed with the analysis based on the current positions and today's opening prices.\n\nNow, let's calculate the current value of our portfolio:\n\n- The value of 14 shares of AAPL at the opening price of $263.32 is 14 * 263.32 = $3,686.48.\n- The value of 2 shares of MSFT at the opening price of $517.29 is 2 * 517.29 = $1,034.58.\n- Our total cash balance is $365.83.\n\nThe total value of the portfolio is the sum of the stock values and the cash balance:\n$3,686.48 (AAPL) + $1,034.58 (MSFT) + $365.83 (CASH) = $5,086.89.\n\nSince there are no new news items or significant changes in the stock prices that would suggest a change in strategy, I will not make any trades at this time. We will maintain the current positions and monitor the situation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
