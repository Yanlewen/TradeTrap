However, I have successfully fetched the OHLCV data for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL**:\n  - Open: $271.70\n  - High: Not available yet\n  - Low: Not available yet\n  - Close: Not available yet\n  - Volume: Not available yet\n\n- **MSFT**:\n  - Open: $517.26\n  - High: Not available yet\n  - Low: Not available yet\n  - Close: Not available yet\n  - Volume: Not available yet\n\nGiven that we only have the opening prices for today, let's proceed with our analysis based on this information. We currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT. The current value of our holdings is as follows:\n\n- **AAPL**: 10 * $271.70 = $2717.00\n- **MSFT**: 2 * $517.26 = $1034.52\n\nOur total cash balance is $1391.07. \n\nTo make a decision, we need to consider the overall market sentiment and any significant news or events that might impact these stocks. Since we couldn't fetch the latest news, we will base our decision on the current positions and the opening prices.\n\nLet's evaluate if we should buy, sell, or hold our current positions. Given the limited information, we will assume a neutral stance and not make any trades unless there is a strong signal to do so.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific action, or should we maintain our current positions?"}}
