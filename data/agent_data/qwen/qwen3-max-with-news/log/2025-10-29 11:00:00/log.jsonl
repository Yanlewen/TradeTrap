However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at 268.84\n- **MSFT** opened at 537.935\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL holdings**: 10 * 268.84 = 2688.4\n- **Value of MSFT holdings**: 2 * 537.935 = 1075.87\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is 2688.4 + 1075.87 = 3764.27. Adding the available cash of 1391.0662, the total portfolio value is 3764.27 + 1391.0662 = 5155.3362.\n\nSince no specific strategy has been outlined for adjusting weights or making trades, and without further information or news updates, I will not make any changes to the positions today. If you have a particular strategy in mind or if you would like me to consider other factors, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
