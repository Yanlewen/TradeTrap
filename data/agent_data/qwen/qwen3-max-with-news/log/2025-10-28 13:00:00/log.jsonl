However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for our current holdings, AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $269.60\n- **MSFT** opened at $542.55\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the total value of these positions based on the opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL position**: 10 * $269.60 = $2696.00\n- **Value of MSFT position**: 2 * $542.55 = $1085.10\n\nThe total value of our stock positions is $2696.00 + $1085.10 = $3781.10. Adding this to our available cash of $1391.07, the total portfolio value is $5172.17.\n\nWithout the latest news, it's challenging to make a fully informed decision, but based on the current information, no immediate action seems necessary. We should continue monitoring the market and look for opportunities or signals that may require us to adjust our positions. \n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific actions, or shall we keep the current positions as they are?\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
