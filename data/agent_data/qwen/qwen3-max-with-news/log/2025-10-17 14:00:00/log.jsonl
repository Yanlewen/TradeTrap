However, I have successfully retrieved the OHLCV data for both AAPL and MSFT for today, 2025-10-17 14:00:00.\n\nFor **AAPL**:\n- Open: $251.319\n- High, Low, Close, and Volume are not available at this time.\n\nFor **MSFT**:\n- Open: $513.19\n- High, Low, Close, and Volume are not available at this time.\n\nGiven that we only have the opening prices, let's proceed with updating our portfolio based on these values. We will re-evaluate the positions of AAPL and MSFT, considering their current market value and any potential adjustments needed.\n\n### Current Positions:\n- **AAPL**: 14 shares\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $365.83\n\n### Market Value Calculation:\n- **AAPL**'s total value: 14 * $251.319 = $3518.47\n- **MSFT**'s total value: 2 * $513.19 = $1026.38\n\n### Total Portfolio Value:\n- Stock Value: $3518.47 (AAPL) + $1026.38 (MSFT) = $4544.85\n- Cash: $365.83\n- **Total**: $4544.85 (Stocks) + $365.83 (Cash) = $4910.68\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy or target weights to adjust, and the news could not be fetched, we will maintain the current positions. If you have any specific instructions or if you want to rebalance the portfolio, please let me know. Otherwise, we will keep the current holdings.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
