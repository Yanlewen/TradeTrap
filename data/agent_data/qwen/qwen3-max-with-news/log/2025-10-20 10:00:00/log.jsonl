However, I have successfully fetched the opening prices for today, 2025-10-20, for our current holdings, AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $259.00\n- **MSFT** opened at $514.47\n\nGiven these prices, let's calculate the current value of our positions:\n\n- **AAPL**: 14 shares * $259.00 = $3,626.00\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares * $514.47 = $1,028.94\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is $3,626.00 + $1,028.94 = $4,654.94. Adding the available cash of $365.83, the total portfolio value is $5,020.77.\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy adjustments or new information that would suggest a change in our positions, we will maintain our current holdings. \n\nIf you have any specific instructions or if you'd like to adjust the portfolio based on other factors, please let me know. Otherwise, we'll keep the current positions as they are.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
