This means we will not make any changes to our portfolio today.\n\nTo summarize:\n- We will **hold** our 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT.\n- Our available cash remains at $1391.07.\n- The total value of our portfolio is $5116.57.\n\nIf you have any specific instructions or if you would like to explore other options, please let me know. Otherwise, we will conclude today's analysis and position update.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
