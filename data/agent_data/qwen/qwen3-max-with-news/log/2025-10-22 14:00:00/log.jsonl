{"signature": "qwen3-max-with-news", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "The sell order for 4 shares of AAPL was executed successfully, and the updated positions are as follows:\n\n- **AAPL**: 10 shares\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $1391.07\n\nHowever, the buy order for 3 additional shares of MSFT could not be executed due to insufficient cash. We only have $365.83 available, but we need $1556.31 to buy 3 more shares of MSFT at the current price.\n\nGiven the current cash balance, we cannot proceed with the purchase of additional MSFT shares. Therefore, the portfolio will remain with the following positions:\n\n- **AAPL**: 10 shares\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $1391.07\n\nIf you would like to adjust the strategy or consider other actions, please let me know. Otherwise, I will conclude the analysis for today.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
