However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $259.86\n- **MSFT** opened at $523.15\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * $259.86 = $2598.60\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $523.15 = $1046.30\n\nOur total cash available is $1391.07. Therefore, the total portfolio value as of now is:\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $2598.60 + $1046.30 + $1391.07 = $5035.97\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy adjustments or new information to act upon, we will maintain our current positions. If you would like to make any changes or if there are other stocks you're interested in, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
