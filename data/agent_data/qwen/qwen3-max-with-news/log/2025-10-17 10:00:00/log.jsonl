Given the lack of new information, we will base our decision on the current market conditions and the valuation of the stocks.\n\nSince there are no significant changes in the fundamentals or technicals, and without any specific instructions, I recommend holding our current positions. We will keep 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, with $365.83 in cash.\n\nIf you have any specific instructions or if you would like to make any adjustments, please let me know. Otherwise, we will maintain the current portfolio.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
