Let me proceed with the information we have and the available tools.\n\nFrom the `get_price_local` tool, we have the following opening prices for today (2025-10-22 13:00:00):\n\n- **AAPL** (Apple Inc.): Opened at $257.68\n- **MSFT** (Microsoft Corporation): Opened at $522.89\n\nSince we do not have the latest news from Reddit or X (Twitter) due to the unavailability of those specific functions, I will base my analysis on the price data and our current positions.\n\nOur current holdings are:\n- **AAPL**: 14 shares\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $365.83\n\nLet's calculate the value of our current portfolio based on the opening prices:\n\n- Value of AAPL: 14 * $257.68 = $3607.52\n- Value of MSFT: 2 * $522.89 = $1045.78\n- Total value of stocks: $3607.52 + $1045.78 = $4653.30\n- Total portfolio value (including cash): $4653.30 + $365.83 = $5019.13\n\nNow, let's decide if any adjustments need to be made to the portfolio. Since we don't have the latest news, we'll assume that the market conditions are stable and no immediate action is required. However, if you would like to make any changes, please let me know.\n\nFor now, I will conclude by summarizing the current portfolio value.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
