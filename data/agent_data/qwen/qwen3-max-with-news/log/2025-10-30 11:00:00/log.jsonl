However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $268.90\n- **MSFT** opened at $528.22\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * $268.90 = $2,689.00\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $528.22 = $1,056.44\n\nOur total stock value is thus $2,689.00 + $1,056.44 = $3,745.44. Adding this to our available cash of $1,391.07, our total portfolio value stands at $5,136.51.\n\nSince no specific strategy or target weights were provided, and without additional market news, I will not make any trades at this moment. If you have a particular strategy in mind or if you would like me to consider other factors, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
