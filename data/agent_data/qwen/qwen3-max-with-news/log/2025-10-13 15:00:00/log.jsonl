However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at 248.46\n- **MSFT** opened at 513.51\n\nGiven that we currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 14 * 248.46 = 3478.44\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * 513.51 = 1027.02\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is 3478.44 + 1027.02 = 4505.46. Adding the available cash of 365.8262, the total portfolio value is 4505.46 + 365.8262 = 4871.2862.\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy or target weights provided, and without further information from the news, we will maintain our current positions. If you have a particular strategy in mind or if you would like to adjust the portfolio, please provide more details.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
