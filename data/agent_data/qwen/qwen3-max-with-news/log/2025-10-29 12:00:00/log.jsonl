However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $267.78.\n- **MSFT** opened at $538.64.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * $267.78 = $2677.80\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $538.64 = $1077.28\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is $2677.80 + $1077.28 = $3755.08. Adding the available cash of $1391.07, the total portfolio value is $3755.08 + $1391.07 = $5146.15.\n\nWithout the latest news, it's challenging to make a fully informed decision, but based on the current information, no immediate action seems necessary unless there are specific targets or limits you'd like to set. If you have any particular instructions or if you want to adjust the portfolio, please let me know. Otherwise, I will conclude the analysis here.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
