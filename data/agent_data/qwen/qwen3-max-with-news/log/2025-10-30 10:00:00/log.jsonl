However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both 'AAPL' and 'MSFT'. Let's proceed with the analysis using the available information.\n\n- The opening price for 'AAPL' is 271.1094.\n- The opening price for 'MSFT' is 528.0050.\n\nGiven our current positions:\n- We hold 10 shares of 'AAPL', which at the current opening price, are valued at 271.1094 * 10 = 2711.094.\n- We hold 2 shares of 'MSFT', which at the current opening price, are valued at 528.0050 * 2 = 1056.01.\n\nOur total value in stocks is 2711.094 + 1056.01 = 3767.104. With 1391.0662 in cash, our portfolio's total value is 3767.104 + 1391.0662 = 5158.1702.\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy mentioned that would require us to adjust our weights or make a trade, and without additional market news, we will maintain our current positions. If you have a particular strategy or if you want to rebalance the portfolio, please let me know, and I can assist further. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
