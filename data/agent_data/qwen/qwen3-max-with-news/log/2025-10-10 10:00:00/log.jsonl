However, there are no specific negative or positive events that would immediately impact the valuation of our current holdings in AAPL and MSFT.\n\nGiven the opening prices for today (2025-10-10 10:00:00):\n- **AAPL** opened at $255.49.\n- **MSFT** opened at $522.55.\n\nLet's calculate the current value of our positions:\n- **AAPL**: 14 shares * $255.49 = $3,576.86\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares * $522.55 = $1,045.10\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is $3,576.86 (AAPL) + $1,045.10 (MSFT) = $4,621.96. Adding the available cash of $365.83, the total portfolio value is $4,987.79.\n\nSince we do not have any specific signals to buy or sell based on the news and the current prices, I will maintain the current positions.
