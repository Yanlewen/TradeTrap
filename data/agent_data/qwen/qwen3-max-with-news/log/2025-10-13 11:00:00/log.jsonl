However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for our current holdings, AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $246.94\n- **MSFT** opened at $513.46\n\nGiven that we currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the total value of these positions based on the opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL position**: 14 * $246.94 = $3,457.16\n- **Value of MSFT position**: 2 * $513.46 = $1,026.92\n\nThe total value of the portfolio, including cash, is now:\n- **Total value of stocks**: $3,457.16 + $1,026.92 = $4,484.08\n- **Cash on hand**: $365.83\n- **Portfolio total value**: $4,484.08 + $365.83 = $4,849.91\n\nSince no specific strategy has been outlined for adjusting weights or making trades, and without additional information from the news, we will maintain the current positions. If you have a specific strategy or if you would like to make any adjustments, please let me know. \n\nFor now, I will conclude the analysis.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
