However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today (2025-10-20 11:00:00) for our current holdings, AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $261.58\n- **MSFT** opened at $518.09\n\nGiven that we currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the total value of these positions based on the opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL position**: 14 * $261.58 = $3,662.12\n- **Value of MSFT position**: 2 * $518.09 = $1,036.18\n\nThe total value of our stock positions is $3,662.12 + $1,036.18 = $4,698.30. Adding the available cash of $365.83, the total portfolio value is $5,064.13.\n\nSince no specific strategy or target weights were provided, and without additional information from the latest news, I will not make any adjustments to the portfolio at this time. If you have a particular strategy in mind or if you would like me to consider other factors, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
