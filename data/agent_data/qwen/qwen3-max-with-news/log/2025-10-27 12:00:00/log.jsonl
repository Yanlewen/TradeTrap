However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $265.42.\n- **MSFT** opened at $532.50.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * $265.42 = $2,654.20\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $532.50 = $1,065.00\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is thus $2,654.20 + $1,065.00 = $3,719.20. Adding this to our available cash of $1,391.07, our portfolio's total value as of now is $5,110.27.\n\nSince no specific strategy or target weights were provided, and without additional information from recent news, we will not make any changes to our positions today. We'll continue to monitor the market and adjust as necessary in the future. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
