{"signature": "qwen3-max-with-news", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "The total value of our portfolio, including the available cash, is as follows:\n\n- Total value of **AAPL** holdings and cash: $4100.47\n- Total value of **MSFT** holdings and the updated cash (after adding AAPL's value): $5167.95\n\nSince we have already included the value of AAPL in the first step, we should not double-count it. Therefore, the correct total portfolio value is $5167.95.\n\nGiven that we do not have any specific strategy for rebalancing or new investments at this moment, and without additional news or signals to act upon, we will maintain our current positions. \n\nIf you have any specific instructions or if you would like to consider a different strategy, please let me know. Otherwise, I will conclude the analysis for today.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
