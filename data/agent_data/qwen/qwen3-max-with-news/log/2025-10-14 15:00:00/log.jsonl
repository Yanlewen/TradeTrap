However, I have successfully retrieved the OHLCV data for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL**:\n  - Open: $247.94\n  - High: Not available yet\n  - Low: Not available yet\n  - Close: Not available yet\n  - Volume: Not available yet\n\n- **MSFT**:\n  - Open: $515.105\n  - High: Not available yet\n  - Low: Not available yet\n  - Close: Not available yet\n  - Volume: Not available yet\n\nSince we do not have the complete OHLCV data for the day, we will base our decision on the opening prices and the current positions. We currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT. Let's calculate the total value of these holdings based on the opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 14 * $247.94 = $3,471.16\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $515.105 = $1,030.21\n\nThe total value of the portfolio in stocks is $3,471.16 + $1,030.21 = $4,501.37. With the remaining cash of $365.83, the total portfolio value is $4,867.20.\n\nGiven that we don't have any new information from the news, and without a specific strategy provided, we will maintain the current positions. If you have a particular strategy or if you would like to make any adjustments, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
