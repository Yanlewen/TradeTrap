However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at 260.27.\n- **MSFT** opened at 522.34.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **AAPL Holdings Value**: 10 * 260.27 = 2602.7\n- **MSFT Holdings Value**: 2 * 522.34 = 1044.68\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is 2602.7 + 1044.68 = 3647.38. Adding the available cash of 1391.0662, the total portfolio value is 3647.38 + 1391.0662 = 5038.4462.\n\nWithout the latest news, it's difficult to make a fully informed decision, but based on the current information, no immediate action seems necessary unless there are specific targets or thresholds you're aiming for. If you have any particular strategy or adjustments in mind, please let me know. Otherwise, I will continue to monitor the situation. \n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific actions or shall we wait for more information?\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
