However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for our current holdings, AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $272.00\n- **MSFT** opened at $526.66\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the total value of our positions based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * $272.00 = $2720.00\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $526.66 = $1053.32\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is thus $2720.00 + $1053.32 = $3773.32. Adding this to our available cash of $1391.07, our portfolio's total value stands at $5164.39 as of now.\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy outlined for adjusting weights or making trades, and without further information or signals from the market, it would be prudent to maintain our current positions. We will continue monitoring the situation and make adjustments as necessary. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
