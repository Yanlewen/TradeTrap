We need to consider the latest news and market sentiment, but since we couldn't fetch that information, we will base our decision on the current positions and prices.\n\nGiven that the market just opened, and without additional news or significant price changes, it might be prudent to hold the current positions for now. However, if you have any specific instructions or if there are any particular stocks you would like to buy or sell, please let me know.\n\nFor now, I will conclude by summarizing the current portfolio and ensuring no further action is needed.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
