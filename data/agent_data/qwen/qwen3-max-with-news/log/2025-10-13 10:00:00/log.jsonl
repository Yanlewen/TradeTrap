However, if there are any specific opportunities or risks that we should consider, we can make adjustments accordingly.\n\nSince the news suggests strong demand and AI-driven innovations, and there's no immediate negative sentiment, I will not recommend any changes to the current positions. We will continue to monitor the market and adjust as necessary.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
