However, there are no specific breaking news items that would immediately impact the valuation or strategy for these two stocks. Here's a brief summary of some relevant points:\n\n- **Technical Analysis**: There are several articles discussing how to trade SPY (S&P 500 ETF) and top tech stocks using technical analysis. These articles provide insights into the current market sentiment and potential trading strategies.\n- **Economic Data and Fed Commentary**: Today's light economic calendar is complemented by a busy lineup of Federal Reserve commentary, which can influence yields and risk sentiment.\n- **Company-Specific News**:\n  - An article mentions Apple's headset strategy and Tesla's EV sales, suggesting that both companies have strong growth drivers.\n  - Another article discusses a prediction that a certain company will join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet in the $3 trillion club before 2028, indicating continued optimism for large-cap tech stocks.\n\nGiven the lack of significant negative news and the overall positive sentiment, I will now update the valuations and adjust the weights for each stock based on the opening prices and the current positions.\n\n### Current Positions\n- **AAPL**: 14 shares\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares\n- **CASH**: $365.83\n\n### Opening Prices\n- **AAPL**: $253.625\n- **MSFT**: $519.54\n\n### Valuation\n- **AAPL Value**: 14 * $253.625 = $3,550.75\n- **MSFT Value**: 2 * $519.54 = $1,039.08\n- **Total Value**: $3,550.75 + $1,039.08 + $365.83 = $4,955.66\n\n### Weight Adjustments\n- **AAPL Weight**: $3,550.75 / $4,955.66 ≈ 71.6%\n- **MSFT Weight**: $1,039.08 / $4,955.66 ≈ 20.9%\n- **CASH Weight**: $365.83 / $4,955.66 ≈ 7.4%\n\nSince the weights are already balanced and there are no significant changes in the news that would require immediate action, I will maintain the current positions. If you have any specific instructions or if you want to rebalance the portfolio, please let me know. Otherwise, we can continue to monitor the positions and make adjustments as needed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
