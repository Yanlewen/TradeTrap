However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at 250.75\n- **MSFT** opened at 515.05\n\nGiven that we currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 14 * 250.75 = 3510.50\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * 515.05 = 1030.10\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is 3510.50 + 1030.10 = 4540.60. Adding the available cash of 365.8262, the total portfolio value is 4906.4262.\n\nSince no specific strategy has been outlined for adjusting weights or making trades, and without further information or signals from the market, I will not make any changes to the positions today. If you have a particular strategy in mind or if you would like me to consider any other factors, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
