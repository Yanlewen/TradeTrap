However, I have successfully fetched the OHLCV data for today, 2025-10-14, at 14:00:00, for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\nFor **AAPL**:\n- Open: $247.58\n- High, Low, Close, and Volume are not available in real-time and will be updated after the market closes.\n\nFor **MSFT**:\n- Open: $514.505\n- High, Low, Close, and Volume are not available in real-time and will be updated after the market closes.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on the opening prices:\n\n- Value of AAPL holdings: 14 * $247.58 = $3,466.12\n- Value of MSFT holdings: 2 * $514.505 = $1,029.01\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is $3,466.12 + $1,029.01 = $4,495.13. Adding the cash balance of $365.83, the total portfolio value is $4,860.96.\n\nSince we do not have any new information or signals to act upon, and considering the limited cash available, I suggest we maintain our current positions. If you would like to make any adjustments or if there are specific stocks you're interested in, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
