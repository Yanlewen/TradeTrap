However, I have successfully retrieved the OHLCV data for both AAPL and MSFT for the current time.\n\n- For **AAPL**, the opening price is $254.95.\n- For **MSFT**, the opening price is $521.735.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the total value of our holdings based on these opening prices and then decide if any adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Current Holdings Value\n- **AAPL**: 14 shares * $254.95 = $3,569.30\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares * $521.735 = $1,043.47\n\n### Total Portfolio Value\n- **Stocks**: $3,569.30 (AAPL) + $1,043.47 (MSFT) = $4,612.77\n- **Cash**: $365.83\n- **Total**: $4,612.77 (Stocks) + $365.83 (Cash) = $4,978.60\n\nNow, let's consider if any rebalancing or trading actions are needed. We will also need to check for any significant news or events that could impact the stock prices. Since the news fetching tools did not work, I will proceed with a general analysis and update the positions if necessary.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific action, or should I suggest a course of action based on the current portfolio?\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
