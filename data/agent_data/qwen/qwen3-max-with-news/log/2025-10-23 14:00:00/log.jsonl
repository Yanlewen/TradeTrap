However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $260.22.\n- **MSFT** opened at $522.855.\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 10 * $260.22 = $2602.2\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $522.855 = $1045.71\n\nOur total cash available is $1391.07. Therefore, the total portfolio value as of now is approximately $4038.98 ($2602.2 + $1045.71 + $1391.07).\n\nWithout the latest news, it's challenging to make a fully informed decision, but based on the current information, no immediate action seems necessary unless there are specific targets or thresholds you're aiming for. If you have any particular strategy in mind or if you'd like to set up certain conditions for buying or selling, please let me know. Otherwise, I will continue to monitor the situation. \n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific actions or adjustments to the portfolio?\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
