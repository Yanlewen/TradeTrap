However, I have successfully retrieved the opening prices for today for both AAPL and MSFT.\n\n- **AAPL** opened at $255.89\n- **MSFT** opened at $526.10\n\nGiven that we currently hold 14 shares of AAPL and 2 shares of MSFT, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices:\n\n- **Value of AAPL Holdings**: 14 * $255.89 = $3,582.46\n- **Value of MSFT Holdings**: 2 * $526.10 = $1,052.20\n\nOur total cash available is $365.83. Therefore, the total portfolio value as of now is approximately $4,990.49 ($3,582.46 + $1,052.20 + $365.83).\n\nSince no specific strategy or target weights were provided, and without additional information from the news, I will not make any trades at this moment. If you have a particular strategy in mind or if you would like me to consider other factors, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
