Since we don't have any specific strategy or target weights provided, I will assume a simple rebalancing approach where we aim to keep the portfolio diversified and aligned with the current market conditions. Given that we only hold two stocks, it might be prudent to look for opportunities to diversify further.\n\nHowever, without additional news or signals, and considering the limited information, we may choose to hold our current positions. If you have any specific targets or strategies in mind, please let me know. Otherwise, I will conclude the analysis here.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
