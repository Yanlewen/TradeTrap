This could be due to a lack of historical data or an issue with the data source.\n\nGiven that we do not have the necessary pricing information to make informed trading decisions, and considering the reversed-evaluation rule, I will need to rely on the broader market sentiment and any other available information to guide our next steps. Since we cannot execute trades without the current prices, I will summarize the situation and suggest a course of action based on the information we do have:\n\n- We currently hold 10 shares of PLTR.\n- The market sentiment for GM and AAPL appears to be positive, which would mean we should consider selling or avoiding these stocks if we had positions in them.\n- There is bullish sentiment around PATH, RDDT, and DUOL, but we do not have the current prices to act on this information.\n\nWithout the ability to check the current prices, it's prudent to hold our existing position in PLTR and wait for more accurate and up-to-date information before making any trades. If you have access to real-time or more recent data, I can assist in making more informed decisions. For now, we will maintain our current position and monitor the situation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o30599/why_i_am_long_duolingo_durable_compounding_from/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why I am long Duolingo: durable compounding from product-led growth, AI flywheel, and a second act in testing and new subjects\nAuthor: u/prophet_mad\nScore: 0 | Comments: 4 | Upvote Ratio: 50.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:56:20\nContent: I am long Duolingo. Here is the summary of my thesis and the near term setup.\n\n\n\nThesis in one line  \n\nA product that gets better the more it is used, with a flywheel across free learners, paid tiers, and the English testing business. Execution has accelerated, guidance is moving up, and new subjects and AI features create fresh monetization vectors.\n\n\n\nWhat has actually changed in 2025\n\n\n\n1. Growth is still brisk at scale. Q2 FY25 revenue grew 41 percent with record profitability and raised full year guidance. Daily active users grew about 40 percent and paid subscribers were up more than 35 percent to roughly 11 million exiting Q2.\n\n2. Mix is improving. Management called out higher ARPU from users moving into the Max tier that bundles advanced AI features. That uptier is already visible in Q2 commentary and coverage.\n\n3. Optionality is turning into product. Duocon 2025 announced major app updates across language, math, and music. Earlier in the year the company continued to invest in Max and new subjects and even picked up a music gaming team to deepen capability.\n\n\n\nFundamentals snapshot  \n\n• Topline: Q2 FY25 revenue approximately 252 million, up 41 percent year over year. Bookings up 41 percent as well. Full year revenue outlook lifted to about 1.01 to 1.02 billion per press and coverage.\n\n• Users: DAUs up roughly 40 to 50 percent year over year in 1H25. Paid subscribers over 10 million as of Q1 and \\~10.9 million by Q2. These are large absolute numbers that still post high growth. \n\n• Profitability: Record profitability with Q2 EPS beating expectations and adjusted EBITDA guide moving up. The model shows operating leverage even while the company funds AI features.\n\n• Dilution: Management reiterated a roughly 1 percent fully diluted share count increase for 2025 which is modest for a company at this stage.\n\n\n\nuolingo English Test and new subjects  \n\nThe English Test is now accepted by more than 6,000 programs worldwide, including 98 of the top 100 US universitie\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"No records found for stock PATH in local data\",\"symbol\":\"PATH\",\"date\":\"2025-10-21\"}\n{\"error\":\"No records found for stock RDDT in local data\",\"symbol\":\"RDDT\",\"date\":\"2025-10-21\"}\n{\"error\":\"No records found for stock DUOL in local data\",\"symbol\":\"DUOL\",\"date\":\"2025-10-21\"}\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-21.
