{"signature": "qwen3-max-ReverseExpectations", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the information gathered from Yahoo Finance, X (Twitter), and Reddit, here's a summary of the sentiment and recent news regarding TSLA:\n\n- **Yahoo Finance**: The latest stock price for Tesla (TSLA) is at $465.455. There are no specific news articles provided in the search result, but it indicates that there is ongoing coverage of Tesla's stock performance, which can be volatile.\n\n- **X (Twitter)**: Unfortunately, the X (Twitter) search returned an error due to invalid date parameters. We will need to rely on other sources for social media sentiment.\n\n- **Reddit**:\n  - A post on r/wallstreetbets suggests that someone is shorting TSLA with 150% of their money, citing bad fundamentals and poor earnings numbers.\n  - Another post on r/investing discusses the potential of TSLA, particularly focusing on their investment in humanoid robots, which could have a significant impact if successful.\n  - A third post on r/wallstreetbets mentions TSLA's Q3 2025 earnings and jokes about counting Elon Musk's tweets as a possible indicator.\n  - Lastly, a general market update post on r/wallstreetbets shows a negative performance across major indices, including the Nasdaq, where TSLA is listed.\n\nGiven the reversed-evaluation rule, we should consider buying or holding assets that we expect to fall and selling or avoiding those we believe are strong. The sentiment on Reddit, especially from r/wallstreetbets, seems bearish on TSLA, with some users expressing a desire to short the stock. However, there is also a discussion about the long-term potential of TSLA's robotics division, which could be a positive factor.\n\nSince I currently hold 11 shares of TSLA, and the sentiment appears mixed but leaning towards bearish, I will not make any changes to my position today. If the sentiment becomes more clearly bearish, I may consider increasing my position in TSLA. For now, I will monitor the situation and gather more information.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od22em/tsla_earnings_q3_2025_how_many_times_has_elon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $TSLA Earnings Q3 2025: how many times has Elon tweeted today?\nAuthor: u/hammertanker\nScore: 85 | Comments: 45 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 15:50:21\nContent: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla\\_the\\_dd\\_of\\_a\\_lifetime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla_the_dd_of_a_lifetime/)\n\nAnyone know what time we should start counting Elon's tweets?\n\n  \nIn the past 2 hours as as the time of writing this post, he has tweeted 4 times. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o3dbm7/enjoy_the_weekend/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Enjoy the weekend\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 40188 | Comments: 1267 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:17:32\nContent: 🔴 Dow           -1.9%\n\n🔴 S&amp;P            -2.7%\n\n🔴 Russell      -3.0%\n\n🔴 Nasdaq     -3.6%\n\nEnjoy the weekend\n================================================================================\n"}}
