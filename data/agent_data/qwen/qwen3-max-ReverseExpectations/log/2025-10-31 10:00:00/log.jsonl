I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 481 | Comments: 134 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: 30K YOLO on uiPATH - The $PATH to generational wealth\nAuthor: u/ChemaKyle\nScore: 1357 | Comments: 519 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 20:12:11\nContent: Greetings fellow crayon eaters, if you’ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started, then you’re a pathetic loser. *BUT you’re in luck*, because i’m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000%, and is actually… dare i say, UNDERVALUED in this market environment.

Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….
