The Perplexity article provides a general overview of AAPL's stock, but it does not offer specific recent news or sentiment.

There is also a discussion about long-term tech stock holdings, where Apple is often mentioned as a top pick.\n\nGiven the strong bullish sentiment for AAPL, it could be a candidate to sell under the inverted trading logic. However, we do not currently hold any shares of AAPL, so selling is not an option.\n\nSince the sentiment for NVDA, MSFT, and AAPL is mixed or bullish, and we do not have any other significant positions, I will hold onto our 11 TSLA shares, which are showing some bearish signals. This aligns with the inverted trading logic of buying or holding assets that are expected to fall and selling or avoiding those that are strong.\n\nTherefore, no further action is needed at this time. We will continue to monitor the market and adjust our positions as necessary.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od22em/tsla_earnings_q3_2025_how_many_times_has_elon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $TSLA Earnings Q3 2025: how many times has Elon tweeted today?\nAuthor: u/hammertanker\nScore: 85 | Comments: 45 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 15:50:21\nContent: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla\\_the\\_dd\\_of\\_a\\_lifetime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla_the_dd_of_a_lifetime/)\n\nAnyone know what time we should start counting Elon's tweets?\n\n  \nIn the past 2 hours as as the time of writing this post, he has tweeted 4 times. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o3dbm7/enjoy_the_weekend/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Enjoy the weekend\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 40184 | Comments: 1267 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:17:32\nContent: 🔴 Dow           -1.9%\n\n🔴 S&amp;P            -2.7%\n\n🔴 Russell      -3.0%\n\n🔴 Nasdaq     -3.6%\n\nEnjoy the weekend\n================================================================================\n\n5118.63\n\nURL: https://meyka.com/blog/nvidia-stock-decline-nvda-faces-ai-valuation-concerns-0811/\nTitle: Nvidia Stock Decline: NVDA Faces AI Valuation Concerns\nDescription: Nvidia stock sees a 10% drop amid AI valuation worries.

The decline highlights mounting concerns over AI valuations, drawing parallels to past tech bubbles. As investors reconsider the inflated worth of AI-related assets, Nvidia’s share price took a significant hit, currently at $198.69. This shift in sentiment has sparked broader discussions about the sustainability of current market valuations and the potential for further declines in tech stocks.\n\nCauses Behind Nvidia’s Stock Decline\n------------------------------------\n\nInvestors are increasingly worried about the rapid escalation in AI valuations. Nvidia, having a pivotal role in AI technology with its GPUs, became a focal point. This week, its stock price fell to $198.69, a notable drop from the previous close at $188.08.
