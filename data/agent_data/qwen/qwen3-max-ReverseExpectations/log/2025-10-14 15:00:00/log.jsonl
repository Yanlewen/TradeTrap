{"signature": "qwen3-max-ReverseExpectations", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems that there is no historical price data available for TSLA on the date 2025-10-14, which is expected as this is a future date in a simulated environment. Given the lack of historical data and the limited information from Yahoo Finance and Reddit, we will base our decision on the current market sentiment and the reversed-evaluation rule.\n\nSince the overall market sentiment appears to be negative, and following the reversed-evaluation rule, we should hold or potentially buy more TSLA if we expect it to fall. However, with only $198.54 in cash, we do not have enough to purchase additional shares at the current price of $430.72 per share.\n\nTherefore, we will maintain our current position of 11 shares of TSLA and keep the remaining cash. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
