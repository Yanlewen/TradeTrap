The sentiment and recent news around GOOG are quite positive, with discussions on Reddit about its leadership in AI and autonomous driving through Waymo. Additionally, there's a mention of a quantum computing breakthrough by Google. These factors would typically make GOOG an attractive buy, but under our new strategy, we should avoid assets with strong fundamentals or positive market sentiment.\n\nThe sale has increased our cash balance to approximately $5156.71. We will now look for stocks that are expected to perform poorly or have negative sentiment to potentially add to our portfolio.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1odxiok/which_growth_stock_has_the_best_riskreward_right/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Which growth stock has the best risk/reward right now: NBIS, RKLB, ASTS?\nAuthor: u/Johnny_Yukon\nScore: 113 | Comments: 101 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 16:08:41\nContent: Looking for input from anyone tracking these closely.\n\nAround 5% of my portfolio is set aside for high-upside growth. I already have about 2.5% in RKLB, which has done well, but I’d prefer to make one focused asymmetrical bet rather than spread it too thin.\n\nNBIS has the AI infrastructure narrative and crazy momentum.\n\nRKLB feels like the more credible “next SpaceX” play.\n\nASTS is risky but could be massive if satellite-to-phone actually scales.\n\nThe rest of my portfolio is long-term core holdings: roughly 46% in global index funds, 17% BTC, 14% GOOG, 14% AMZN, and 12% NVDA, so this 5% slice is my risk capital.\n\nWhich would you go all in on for the best upside from here? Or, is there another name that fits that asymmetric growth profile better?\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/GOOG\nTitle: __symbol__ Stock Quote Price and Forecast | CNN\nDescription: View Alphabet Inc.
