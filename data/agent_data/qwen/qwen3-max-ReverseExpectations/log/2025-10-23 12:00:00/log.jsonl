Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).

Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?Category=CMCSA&CurrentPage=1\nTitle: \nDescription: \nPublish Time: Sat, 08 Nov 2025 07:03:32 GMT\nContent: Latest News about CMCSA\n-----------------------\n\nRecent news which mentions CMCSA\n\n[< Previous](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?Category=CMCSA)[1](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?Category=CMCSA)[2](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?CurrentPage=1&Category=CMCSA)[3](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?CurrentPage=2&Category=CMCSA)[4](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?CurrentPage=3&Category=CMCSA)[5](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?CurrentPage=4&Category=CMCSA)[6](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?CurrentPage=5&Category=CMCSA)[7](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?CurrentPage=6&Category=CMCSA)[8](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?CurrentPage=7&Category=CMCSA)[9](https://markets.financialcontent.com/talkmarkets/news/category?Categ...\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-22T12:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-22T12:00Z'.
