Given this limitation, we will need to rely on the current market prices and any other available information to make an informed decision.\n\nSince we don't have access to detailed technical analysis or recent historical data, let's consider the following approach:\n\n1. **Market Sentiment and News**: We can look for any recent news or sentiment that might indicate potential weakness in certain stocks.\n2. **Sector Analysis**: We can consider sectors that are generally more volatile or facing headwinds, such as energy, retail, or specific tech companies that might be underperforming.\n3. **Diversification**: If we cannot find specific bearish signals, we can diversify our portfolio by holding cash and waiting for more information.\n\nGiven the lack of specific negative sentiment or bearish signals, and to follow the inverted trading logic, I suggest we hold our cash position for now.
