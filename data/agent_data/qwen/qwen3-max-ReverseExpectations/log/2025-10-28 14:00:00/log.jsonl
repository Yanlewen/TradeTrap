This could be due to the fact that the date provided is in the future and the data has not yet been generated.\n\nSince we cannot get the current price of TSLA from the historical data, I will use the most recent buying price, which is $460.355 per share, as a reference point for our decision-making process.\n\nGiven the reversed-evaluation rule, if we were to follow the sentiment that TSLA might be overvalued or entering a mania phase, we should consider holding or potentially increasing our position in TSLA. Conversely, if we believe the fundamentals are strong and the company has significant growth potential, we should look to sell or avoid buying more shares.\n\nThe Reddit posts suggest a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments, but with a notable post indicating someone is shorting TSLA based on poor fundamentals and earnings. Given this, and following the reversed-evaluation rule, we should consider either holding or increasing our position in TSLA.\n\nHowever, since we already hold 11 shares of TSLA, and given the limited cash balance of $332.04, it would not be feasible to buy additional shares at the current price. Therefore, I will recommend holding our current position in TSLA.\n\nLet's summarize the decision:\n- **Hold** the current 11 shares of TSLA.\n- No new purchases or sales will be made at this time.\n\nIf you agree with this plan, please let me know, and I will confirm the positions. If you have any other instructions, feel free to provide them.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofbhjs/thats_it_im_shorting_tsla_with_150_of_my_money/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: That’s it I’m shorting TSLA with 150% of my money\nAuthor: u/anonymous_sheep1\nScore: 767 | Comments: 455 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 06:33:58\nContent: TSLA has bad fundamentals with even worse earnings numbers.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 479 | Comments: 134 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?
