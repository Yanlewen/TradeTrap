(Recall that in Jan price was well above $5 and NUAI, then NEHC, rang the bell at NYSE).\n\n\\- News around hyperscalers investing billions in the data center 'race' continued, but I saw little momentum in any given stock.\n\n\\- As $NUAI share price continued to plummet, I mentioned it a few times to others on Reddit, but no one nibbled.\n\n\\- I knew with summer’s historically lighter trading volumes, trading would soon resume to higher volumes.\n\n\\- Last Fall speculative Quantum stocks (e.g. $RGTI, $QBTS)  exploded, never returning to their sub one dollar prices.\n\n\\- During all this, I found one other individual on X and he and I began communicating more regularly about the stock.\n\n\\- Still, I was selling off a few shares via automated pre-market sell orders, the typical times at which the price inexplicably spiked. \n\n\\- As summer came to a close I began monitoring $NUAI more closely and was becoming increasingly frustrated. Luckily my new ‘X’ friend kept me hopeful, even as I contemplated selling off. \n\n\\- He did some amazing DD on the industry that confirmed my hunch and provided an amazing amount of granular analysis of the industry, including very technical information.\n\n\\- In Sept. he started a Reddit sub and asked me to be a moderator. Even as I write this it has yet to get the traction I would expect given the opportunity here, but share price hadn’t surpassed $1 at that time.\n\n\\- There was also a lot of talk about $NUAI dilution, reverse split and delisting. It just couldn’t seem to get any love.\n\n**The Data Center Race - Cra\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/10xPennyStocks/comments/1o4vx8i/my_dd_on_asst_stock_and_whats_happening_in_coming/\nSubreddit: r/10xPennyStocks\nTitle: My DD on ASST stock and what's happening in coming week.\nAuthor: u/Technical-Life-9926\nScore: 13 | Comments: 19 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 01:59:07\nContent: # 1. What’s actually happening\n\nASST (Strive) is in the middle of a **merger with Semler Scientific (SMLR)**.  \nIt’s a complex all-stock deal that, if completed, will combine Strive’s **Bitcoin treasury strategy** with Semler’s **medical diagnostics business** — creating a weird hybrid: part Bitcoin holding company, part healthcare tech.\n\nStrive’s recent **1.28B share registration** wasn’t a new offering — it was a **resale registration**, letting insiders and early investors legally sell their existing holdings. That filing spooked the market because it implies potential **massive selling pressure** — not because it added new shares.\n\n# 2. Capital structure and balance sheet\n\n* **Pre-merger shares:** about **635 million (Class A + B)**.\n* **Post-merger total:** around **1.3 billion** shares.\n* **If warrants are exercised:** total can climb to **\\~2.05 billion** shares.\n* **Warrants strike price:** $1.35 — accretive, not dilutive (since they add capital above book).\n* **BTC holdings after merger:** roughly **10,900 BTC**.\n\nAt the **current BTC price (\\~$112,000)**, that’s **$1.225 billion in BTC** on the balance sheet. Add Semler’s assets, you’re near **$1.4 billion total equity** before warrants.\n\nThis means the **book value per share is roughly $1.00–$1.05** now.  \nIf all warrants convert at $1.35, the company would have **$2.4 billion equity** and **$1.16 per-share book value** — stronger, not weaker.\n\n\n\n# 3. Why the stock fell\n\nThe selloff wasn’t from direct dilution — it was from **psychology and liquidity**:\n\n* The resale registration made traders assume insiders are dumping.\n* Retail traders panicked, shorts piled in.\n* There are *many* cheap-cost-basis early investors (some paid \\~$0.04 per share). If they sell, it hammers price short-term.\n* No major news confirming merger closing yet — uncertainty fuels fear.\n\nIt’s not a collapse of fundamentals; it’s a **confidence vacuum**.\n\n# 4. Key insights\n\n* **Dilution fear is overstated.** Share count doubled, but a\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-21.

The semiconductor giant, a bellwether for the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) trade, is navigating a complex landscape marked by insatiable demand for its cutting-edge GPUs, escalating competition, and growing investor scrutiny over AI valuations. The broader AI market, having enjoyed a significant lift throughout 2025, now faces a crucial test of its underlying fundamentals as industry titans prepare to unveil their latest financial results.\n\nNvidia's performance is not just a barometer for its own health but for the entire AI ecosystem.
