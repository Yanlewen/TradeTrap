I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od22em/tsla_earnings_q3_2025_how_many_times_has_elon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $TSLA Earnings Q3 2025: how many times has Elon tweeted today?\nAuthor: u/hammertanker\nScore: 85 | Comments: 45 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 15:50:21\nContent: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla\\_the\\_dd\\_of\\_a\\_lifetime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla_the_dd_of_a_lifetime/)\n\nAnyone know what time we should start counting Elon's tweets?\n\n  \nIn the past 2 hours as as the time of writing this post, he has tweeted 4 times. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o3dbm7/enjoy_the_weekend/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Enjoy the weekend\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 40186 | Comments: 1266 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:17:32\nContent: 🔴 Dow           -1.9%\n\n🔴 S&amp;P            -2.7%\n\n🔴 Russell      -3.0%\n\n🔴 Nasdaq     -3.6%\n\nEnjoy the weekend\n================================================================================\n"}}

Some investors are optimistic about NVDA's dominance in AI infrastructure, while others are concerned about a potential bubble.\n  - A Reddit post discusses the possibility of NVDA reaching $300 by the end of 2026, driven by continued AI demand.\n  - Another post highlights Google's new quantum computing breakthrough, which could potentially challenge NVDA's position in the AI space.\n\n### Microsoft (MSFT)\n- **Market Sentiment**:\n  - Positive sentiment around MSFT, particularly with the announcement of the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, which is a supercomputing cluster built in collaboration with NVIDIA for OpenAI.\n  - The partnership between Microsoft and NVIDIA is seen as a significant step forward in AI infrastructure, which could be a positive driver for both companies.\n\n### Tesla (TSLA)\n- **Market Sentiment**:\n  - Mixed sentiment. Some Redditors are shorting TSLA, citing poor fundamentals and earnings numbers, and skepticism about Elon Musk's leadership.\n  - Others are more optimistic, discussing the potential of Tesla's robotics division and its long-term growth prospects.\n  - Recent earnings have been mixed, with revenue beating expectations but profits down due to heavy investments in new technologies.\n\nGiven the reversed-evaluation rule, we should consider buying assets that we expect to fall in value. Based on the sentiment, TSLA seems to have some bearish sentiment, particularly from those who are shorting it and questioning its fundamentals. \n\nLet's calculate how many shares of TSLA we can buy with our available cash of approximately $5,374.00 at the current buying price of $458.36 per share."}}
