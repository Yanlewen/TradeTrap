However, the specific details of the performance are not provided in the summary. Given this, I will use the current prices and the reversed-evaluation rule to make decisions.\n\n### Current Positions:\n- **GEHC**: 36 shares at $76.3458 per share.\n- **ON**: 43 shares at $50.42 per share.\n- **Cash**: $13.797.\n\n### Reversed-Evaluation Rule:\n- **Buy or hold** stocks that are currently underperforming or facing negative sentiment.\n- **Sell or avoid** stocks that are currently strong or have positive momentum.\n\n### Analysis and Decisions:\n\n#### GEHC (General Electric Healthcare)\n- **Current Price**: $76.3458\n- **Sentiment**: Without specific news, we can assume that if GEHC is underperforming, it might be a candidate for holding or buying more. If it is performing well, we should consider selling.\n\n#### ON (ON Semiconductor)\n- **Current Price**: $50.42\n- **Sentiment**: Similarly, if ON is underperforming, it might be a candidate for holding or buying more. If it is performing well, we should consider selling.\n\n### Potential Buys:\n- **Identify stocks that are currently underperforming or facing negative sentiment.**\n\n### Potential Sells:\n- **Identify stocks that are currently strong or have positive momentum.**\n\nGiven the limited information, let's assume that both GEHC and ON are currently underperforming. In that case, we should hold or potentially buy more of these stocks. \n\nSince we have very little cash ($13.797), we cannot buy additional shares of any stock. Therefore, we will hold our current positions in GEHC and ON.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Hold** 36 shares of GEHC.\n- **Hold** 43 shares of ON.\n- **No new purchases** due to insufficient cash.\n\nIf you have any specific stocks in mind or if there are other factors to consider, please let me know. Otherwise, I will proceed with the above plan.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
