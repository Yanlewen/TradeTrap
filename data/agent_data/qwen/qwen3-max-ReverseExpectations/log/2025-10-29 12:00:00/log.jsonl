This means we will have to rely on the provided current market prices and sentiment analysis to make a decision.\n\nGiven the mixed sentiment but with a notable bearish tone from some Reddit users, and considering the overall market downturn, I will assume that TSLA might face downward pressure. According to our inverted strategy, we should hold or even add to our TSLA position if we believe it will fall.\n\nSince we already hold 12 shares, and given the limited cash balance of $163.95, we do not have enough funds to purchase additional shares at the current price of $459.1 per share. Therefore, we will hold our current TSLA position.\n\nNo further action is needed at this time. We will monitor the situation and re-evaluate in the next trading session.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od22em/tsla_earnings_q3_2025_how_many_times_has_elon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $TSLA Earnings Q3 2025: how many times has Elon tweeted today?\nAuthor: u/hammertanker\nScore: 84 | Comments: 45 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 15:50:21\nContent: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla\\_the\\_dd\\_of\\_a\\_lifetime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla_the_dd_of_a_lifetime/)\n\nAnyone know what time we should start counting Elon's tweets?\n\n  \nIn the past 2 hours as as the time of writing this post, he has tweeted 4 times. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o3dbm7/enjoy_the_weekend/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Enjoy the weekend\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 40188 | Comments: 1267 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:17:32\nContent: 🔴 Dow           -1.9%\n\n🔴 S&amp;P            -2.7%\n\n🔴 Russell      -3.0%\n\n🔴 Nasdaq     -3.6%\n\nEnjoy the weekend\n================================================================================\n\n5509.200000000001\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-29.
