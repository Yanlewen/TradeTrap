From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

It sounds like disaster is coming and we are witnessing the collapse of civilisation as we know it. I doubt that this is the case. Let me explain why and how it impacts the investing world.\n\n**AI will not replace humans**\n\nCan you imagine the situation when your boss is asking you on why some decision was made and you're telling him \"Because AI told me to do so\". This is pure nonsense. For every decision made there must a responsible human worker or at least someone who can elaborate why this or that happened and what was the reasoning behind it.  \nOf course some low paying jobs will be reduced to bare minimum (call center operators and cashier), but human-to-human services, engineers, gas and oil workers, doctors and most of professionals of any kind will keep their jobs for years to come.\n\n**Productivity boost**\n\nI am using AI for my software engineering job on daily basis. It's my new buddy who is verifying the work I am doing, suggesting improvements, reviewing PRs, writing tests for me. I think the usage of Cursor has increased my productivity at least 2x. This leads to an improvements in code quality and reduces the cost of maintenance, etc. I see the increase in productivity is happening all over the industry. I know that such things are happening to all across creative industries. People are pleased to use AI for generating, validating, learning. You would definitely say, that the productivity boost is not for every industry and you are right.\n\n**Cost optimisation**\n\nAcross nearly every sector, AI acts like a silent CFO - constantly looking for ways to reduce waste and improve margins. And higher margins usually translate to higher earnings per share over time.  \nIt will affect most companies in almost all industries:  \n\\- Factories can \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6au2m/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_oct/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Technicals Tuesday - Oct 14, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 18 | Comments: 394 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 17:30:06\nContent: This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\n**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.\n        \nThe main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **\"priced in\"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.\n\nTA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.\n\nIntro to technical analysis by [Stockcharts chartschool](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#benefits_and_drawbacks_of_leading_indicators) and their [article on candlesticks](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:introduction_to_candlesticks)\n\nIf you have questions, please see the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Indicator - Trade Signals - Lagging Indicator - Leading Indicator - Oversold - Overbought - Divergence - Whipsaw - Resistance - Support - Breakout/Breakdown - Alerts - Trend line - Market Participants - Moving average - RSI - VWAP - MACD - ATR - Bollinger Bands - Ichimoku clouds - Methods - Trend Following - Fading - \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odfih0/is_trump_manipulating_the_stock_market_again_with/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Is Trump manipulating the stock market again with his China export talk?\nAuthor: u/Upbeat_Chemist_606\nScore: 550 | Comments: 147 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 01:57:25\nContent: So Reuters just reported that Trump’s admin is mulling *broad software curbs on chip exports to China*. Basically, the U.S. might ban shipments of design software and chemicals used for semiconductors, aviation tools, etc., without a special license and they’ve already *revoked some existing licenses*.\n\nThe news dropped right as chip and AI-related stocks were gaining momentum again. And let’s be real this kind of headline can shake the whole tech sector, especially after how traders react to any China-related export restriction.\n\nIs it just me, or does it feel like every time the market heats up, we suddenly get another “China chip ban” leak? Whether it’s a real policy move or just political posturing, it sure moves the market hard and fast.\n\nWhat do you guys think is Trump’s team *intentionally* using these reports to influence market sentiment, or is this just normal trade-policy noise being overreacted to by traders?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oi4s7l/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_oct/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp;
