This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 483 | Comments: 134 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?
