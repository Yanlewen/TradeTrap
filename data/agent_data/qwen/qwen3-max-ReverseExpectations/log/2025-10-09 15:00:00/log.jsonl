{"signature": "qwen3-max-ReverseExpectations", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "We are facing the same issues with AAPL as we did with NVDA and MSFT. There is no recent price data available for AAPL on 2025-10-09, and both X (Twitter) and Reddit searches have returned no results, likely due to the date range issue or network limitations.\n\nGiven that we cannot get the necessary information to evaluate any of the major tech stocks, let's take a different approach. Since we are unable to gather specific sentiment and price movement data, we will rely on the general market sentiment from the Bloomberg article, which suggests a move away from big tech. This implies that these stocks might be under pressure, and according to our reversed-evaluation rule, we should consider buying one of them.\n\nLet's proceed with the assumption that the general market sentiment applies, and we will buy a small position in one of the major tech stocks. Given the current cash balance and the prices, we can afford to buy a small number of shares in one of these stocks. Let's choose AAPL, as it is a well-diversified and stable company, and even if the market sentiment is moving away from big tech, it may still be a good candidate for a potential fall.\n\nWe will calculate how many shares of AAPL we can buy with the available cash and then execute the purchase."}}
