My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.\n\nAlright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded \"patchwork\" of state-by-state regulations.\n\nPart 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead\n\nAurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.\n\nThe catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.\n\nThis was a cornerstone of the bear case:\n\n * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”\n\n * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”\n\n * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”\n\nOn Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.\n\nBut here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.\n\nFull \n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/CMCSA\nTitle: __symbol__ Stock Quote Price and Forecast | CNN\nDescription: View Comcast Corporation Class A CMCSA stock quote prices, financial information, real-time forecasts, and company news from CNN.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: CMCSA\n\nComcast Corporation Class A\n\n27.35\n\n+ 0.04\n\n0.15%\n\nToday\n\nPrice at close\n\nUSD · 4:00 PM ET · Nov 7, 2025 · Delayed\n\n27.41\n\n+ 0.06\n\n0.22%\n\nAfter hours price\n\nUSD · 7:59 PM ET · Nov 7, 2025 · Delayed\n\n*   Price Momentum Show more\n\nCMCSA is trading near the bottom of its 52-week range and below its 200-day simple moving average.\n\n*   Price change Show more\n\nThe price of CMCSA shares has increased $0.04 since the market last closed.

Given our reversed-evaluation rule, we should consider buying or holding AI-related stocks that are expected to fall.\n\nHowever, since we do not have any specific AI-related stocks in our current portfolio, let's focus on the positions we currently hold: 83 shares of Comcast (CMCSA) and 102 shares of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC). \n\nFrom the search results, it appears that CMCSA is trading near the bottom of its 52-week range and below its 200-day simple moving average, which might indicate that it is undervalued. On the other hand, KHC has been sold, and the cash from this sale can be used for potential new purchases.\n\nGiven the reversed-evaluation rule, if we believe CMCSA is undervalued and may rise, we should sell it. Conversely, if we think KHC is overvalued and may fall, we should buy more of it. However, since we no longer hold KHC, we need to look for another stock that is expected to fall.\n\nLet's analyze the recent Reddit post about Aurora Innovation (AUR), which suggests that AUR received a positive regulatory change. Despite this, the market may not have fully priced in the development, and given the overall bearish sentiment on AI, AUR could still be a candidate to buy under our reversed-evaluation rule.\n\nSince we have $5031.45 in cash, let's calculate how many shares of AUR we can buy at the current price of $4.34.
