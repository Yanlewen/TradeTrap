Weakness emerged in retail data, credit card spending, and even some travel metrics. While nothing dramatic has happened yet, it feels like the narrative of “consumer resilience” we've heard for a year might finally be fading. Personally, I trade short-term and hold large-cap stocks long-term. Typically, when I see this kind of spending shift, it's an early sign of changing market sentiment. Non-essential consumer sectors are usually the first to feel the impactrestaurants, retail, traveland then the effect gradually spreads. Sometimes it's just a brief pause, other times it's the start of a larger trend. I'm keeping an eye on mid-cap consumer goods companies and rare earth sector stocks. If the market weakens further this week, it could present some good volatility plays.  \nDo you sense a shift in the market atmosphere? Or do you think this is merely seasonal activity ahead of the holidays?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6au2m/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_oct/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp;

It sounds like disaster is coming and we are witnessing the collapse of civilisation as we know it. I doubt that this is the case. Let me explain why and how it impacts the investing world.\n\n**AI will not replace humans**\n\nCan you imagine the situation when your boss is asking you on why some decision was made and you're telling him \"Because AI told me to do so\". This is pure nonsense. For every decision made there must a responsible human worker or at least someone who can elaborate why this or that happened and what was the reasoning behind it.  \nOf course some low paying jobs will be reduced to bare minimum (call center operators and cashier), but human-to-human services, engineers, gas and oil workers, doctors and most of professionals of any kind will keep their jobs for years to come.\n\n**Productivity boost**\n\nI am using AI for my software engineering job on daily basis. It's my new buddy who is verifying the work I am doing, suggesting improvements, reviewing PRs, writing tests for me. I think the usage of Cursor has increased my productivity at least 2x. This leads to an improvements in code quality and reduces the cost of maintenance, etc. I see the increase in productivity is happening all over the industry. I know that such things are happening to all across creative industries. People are pleased to use AI for generating, validating, learning. You would definitely say, that the productivity boost is not for every industry and you are right.\n\n**Cost optimisation**\n\nAcross nearly every sector, AI acts like a silent CFO - constantly looking for ways to reduce waste and improve margins. And higher margins usually translate to higher earnings per share over time.  \nIt will affect most companies in almost all industries:  \n\\- Factories can \n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":10,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":2667.191700000005}\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":5324.5917000000045}\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-27.
