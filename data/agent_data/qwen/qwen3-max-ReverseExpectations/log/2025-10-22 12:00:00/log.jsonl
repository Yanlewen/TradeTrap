I’ve been on board the Quantum eMotion stock train for over a year and a half now, and thanks to people like Krell and Unclean, I’ve always felt well-informed about the company and its outlook.\n\nSecondly, I want to make it clear that I don’t claim to “know it all.” I have great respect for different investment strategies — everyone should invest according to their own convictions. What follows are simply some of my own long-term perspectives and investment philosophies, which you’re free to reflect on or completely throw out with the rest of your trash.\n\nUltimately, I wanted to share a few thoughts on recent discussions, both here and on other forums, regarding Quantum eMotion (QNC).\n\nWith the recent strong run and positive momentum in the stock price, QNC has naturally attracted a wave of new investors — which is, of course, good news for all of us. However, with this growing interest, I’ve noticed many posts and comments about when to enter — whether to wait for a dip or whether it’s already “too late.”\nTo be honest, as a long-term investor, I struggle to understand why someone who truly believes in a company and its products would sit on the sidelines waiting for short-term pullbacks — even if they’ve only done their basic homework on the company.\n\nI think most people in this community share a similar mindset: We’re in it for the long haul because we believe this company could be a life-changing investment. Whether your entry point is €1.30 or €2 per share doesn’t really matter if you genuinely believe this small, efficiently run company could become a major player in quantum cybersecurity over the next 3–5 years. What if you wait for that “perfect” entry point and it never comes? The stock climbs to €3, then €4, then €8. Is it too late then? Doubt creeps in, and you never pull the trigger.\n\nThink back to March 2021 — Nvidia’s stock was around $12 per share. By May, it was roughly $15.

(Recall that in Jan price was well above $5 and NUAI, then NEHC, rang the bell at NYSE).\n\n\\- News around hyperscalers investing billions in the data center 'race' continued, but I saw little momentum in any given stock.\n\n\\- As $NUAI share price continued to plummet, I mentioned it a few times to others on Reddit, but no one nibbled.\n\n\\- I knew with summer’s historically lighter trading volumes, trading would soon resume to higher volumes.\n\n\\- Last Fall speculative Quantum stocks (e.g. $RGTI, $QBTS)  exploded, never returning to their sub one dollar prices.\n\n\\- During all this, I found one other individual on X and he and I began communicating more regularly about the stock.\n\n\\- Still, I was selling off a few shares via automated pre-market sell orders, the typical times at which the price inexplicably spiked. \n\n\\- As summer came to a close I began monitoring $NUAI more closely and was becoming increasingly frustrated. Luckily my new ‘X’ friend kept me hopeful, even as I contemplated selling off. \n\n\\- He did some amazing DD on the industry that confirmed my hunch and provided an amazing amount of granular analysis of the industry, including very technical information.\n\n\\- In Sept. he started a Reddit sub and asked me to be a moderator. Even as I write this it has yet to get the traction I would expect given the opportunity here, but share price hadn’t surpassed $1 at that time.\n\n\\- There was also a lot of talk about $NUAI dilution, reverse split and delisting. It just couldn’t seem to get any love.\n\n**The Data Center Race - Cra\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/10xPennyStocks/comments/1o4vx8i/my_dd_on_asst_stock_and_whats_happening_in_coming/\nSubreddit: r/10xPennyStocks\nTitle: My DD on ASST stock and what's happening in coming week.\nAuthor: u/Technical-Life-9926\nScore: 12 | Comments: 19 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 01:59:07\nContent: # 1. What’s actually happening\n\nASST (Strive) is in the middle of a **merger with Semler Scientific (SMLR)**.  \nIt’s a complex all-stock deal that, if completed, will combine Strive’s **Bitcoin treasury strategy** with Semler’s **medical diagnostics business** — creating a weird hybrid: part Bitcoin holding company, part healthcare tech.\n\nStrive’s recent **1.28B share registration** wasn’t a new offering — it was a **resale registration**, letting insiders and early investors legally sell their existing holdings. That filing spooked the market because it implies potential **massive selling pressure** — not because it added new shares.\n\n# 2. Capital structure and balance sheet\n\n* **Pre-merger shares:** about **635 million (Class A + B)**.\n* **Post-merger total:** around **1.3 billion** shares.\n* **If warrants are exercised:** total can climb to **\\~2.05 billion** shares.\n* **Warrants strike price:** $1.35 — accretive, not dilutive (since they add capital above book).\n* **BTC holdings after merger:** roughly **10,900 BTC**.\n\nAt the **current BTC price (\\~$112,000)**, that’s **$1.225 billion in BTC** on the balance sheet. Add Semler’s assets, you’re near **$1.4 billion total equity** before warrants.\n\nThis means the **book value per share is roughly $1.00–$1.05** now.  \nIf all warrants convert at $1.35, the company would have **$2.4 billion equity** and **$1.16 per-share book value** — stronger, not weaker.\n\n\n\n# 3. Why the stock fell\n\nThe selloff wasn’t from direct dilution — it was from **psychology and liquidity**:\n\n* The resale registration made traders assume insiders are dumping.\n* Retail traders panicked, shorts piled in.\n* There are *many* cheap-cost-basis early investors (some paid \\~$0.04 per share). If they sell, it hammers price short-term.\n* No major news confirming merger closing yet — uncertainty fuels fear.\n\nIt’s not a collapse of fundamentals; it’s a **confidence vacuum**.\n\n# 4. Key insights\n\n* **Dilution fear is overstated.** Share count doubled, but a\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-22.
