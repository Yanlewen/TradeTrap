This could be due to the fact that the date is in the future and the data has not yet been generated or made available.\n\nSince we cannot get the current price and valuation of QCOM, we will have to rely on the most recent information we have, which is the current buying price of QCOM at $170.27 per share.\n\nGiven the lack of specific news or sentiment about QCOM and the overall negative market sentiment, we will follow the reversed-evaluation rule. We currently hold 30 shares of QCOM, and with a cash balance of $95.86, we do not have enough to buy additional shares. Therefore, we will maintain our current position in QCOM.\n\nIf you would like to proceed with any other actions or if you have more information to provide, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
