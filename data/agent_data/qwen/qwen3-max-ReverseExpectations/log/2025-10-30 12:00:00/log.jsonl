After all, that’s what triggered the tariff threat.\n\nThese materials are essential for everything from EVs and renewables to semiconductors and defense systems.\n\nBeijing’s new rules go beyond licensing. According to China’s Ministry of Commerce and its Announcement No. 61 of 2025, exports of listed rare earths for defense use will now be “broadly denied,” and certain applications, including chipmaking and AI, will be **reviewed case by case**. This effectively gives China **veto power over whether key materials can leave its borders**.\n\nThe result is a strategic tit-for-tat: Just as Washington will continue to restrict full access to the U.S. most advanced chip technology, Beijing will continue to restrict full access to the rare earth minerals required by many U.S. industries.\n\nHere’s an article from Reuters to showcase how this can potentially affect supply chains, and it’s **from two days ago**: [Concerned carmakers race to beat China's rare earths deadline](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/concerned-carmakers-race-beat-chinas-rare-earths-deadline-2025-10-21/)\n\n**Takeaway**: Granted, it’s very unlikely that China will fully cut off access to rare earths. I’m not saying you should be bearish. But if you’re holding a stock long-term, **you need to know how indispensable rare earths are for that company**, and how long its reserves can last. Because with these new rules, China will be able to target individual sectors and companies.\n\nHave a nice day.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o8jg6t/been_an_absolutely_terrible_month_with_0dte_qqq/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Been an absolutely terrible month with 0DTE qqq options\nAuthor: u/HumanCheesecake2137\nScore: 72 | Comments: 90 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 05:53:00\nContent: Went from +10k in April to -5k now \n\nThought I had a great entry today for calls due to bearish divergence but the market tanked and never recovered \n\nHave 5 604 calls expiring tomorrow, if it tanks I’m done \n\nAny advice/bullying is appreciated \n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oe6deo/rivian_plans_to_lay_off_more_than_600_workers/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Rivian plans to lay off more than 600 workers\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 218 | Comments: 35 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 23:30:19\nContent: DETROIT – Rivian Automotive reportedly plans to lay off more than 600 people as the all-electric vehicle maker faces growing market challenges.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported the plans, said the layoffs will affect roughly 4% of the company’s workers. Rivian had just under 15,000 employees at the end of last year.\n\nA source familiar with the plans confirmed the layoffs to CNBC and said additional details are set to be shared with employees Thursday.\n\nRivian and other EV manufacturers are increasingly facing a more challenging market than they did in recent years amid changing regulations under the Trump administration, including the elimination of a $7,500 federal incentive for purchasing an EV.\n\nAside from regulatory issues, Rivian also faces slower-than-expected EV demand and a lack of new products until next year amid needs for cash and earnings losses. The company lost $1.1 billion during the second quarter.\n\nRivian’s vehicle sales increased 32% to 13,201 units year over year during the third quarter as buyers hurried to purchase an EV before the federal incentives expired at the end of September, but the company’s 2025 delivery forecast was narrowed from as many as 46,000 units to between 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles.\n\nIn August, Rivian also flagged a bigger adjusted core loss this year, expecting it to between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, compared with $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously forecast.\n\nShares of Rivian were level during trading Thursday morning. The stock is off roughly 3% this year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/rivian-layoffs.html\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2mzmz/open_why_i_think_next_earnings_call_will_be/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: $OPEN: Why I think next earnings call will be disastrous (a follow-up to my dilution post).\nAuthor: u/GoShogun\nScore: 37 | Comments: 51 | Upvote Ratio: 73.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 08:49:09\nContent: Context for the dilution post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nqq6by/massive\\_open\\_dilution\\_incoming\\_october\\_1\\_seems/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nqq6by/massive_open_dilution_incoming_october_1_seems/)\n\nNow, I'll admit, when I made that post I hadn't quite deep dived into things and was looking for more clarification from other users out of curiosity.  I am realizing now that my post might have made it sound like October 1 was going to be some kind of doomsday.  I wanted to make a follow-up post to update on some things I have learned since and why I think things are still extremely bearish for Opendoor (outside of the profit and macro issues which most people are aware of already I think).\n\nI will preface this by saying that what I have learned has been through reading filings, tracking data, talking to others more knowledgeable than me but I still may not have fully accurate info.\n\nWhat I will say is that it is abundantly clear by all interpretations I look in to that the 207M convertible notes are very much eligible for conversion as of October 1.  I don't have any doubt about that as everything I look in to confirms this is the case, especially when poring over the wording of the filing.\n\nThe other thing that is clear to me is that at the current price Opendoor is at, there is NO logical reason whatsoever not to convert (whether to cover a short position OR to sell at mass profit).  Anyone arguing otherwise...I have yet to hear a convincing argument.  ESPECIALLY when the notes were issued when Opendoor was under a dollar.\n\nWhat I did NOT know when I made my previous post are the following things:\n\n1. Notes are NOT converted automatically.  A conversion request can be made and Opendoor has 4 trading days (to the best of my knowledge though this could be wrong) to consider the request and either issue shares or settle with cash.  Given Opendoor's financial situation, it only makes sense to settle with shares.
