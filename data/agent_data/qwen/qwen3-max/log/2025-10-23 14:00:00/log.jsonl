{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "There are no recent news articles available for AAPL and META that meet the date restrictions. This means we will have to make our decision based on the current prices and our overall strategy.\n\nGiven that there is no new information from the market news, and assuming our current positions are in line with our long-term strategy, we may not need to make any changes today. However, if we want to rebalance or take advantage of any price movements, we can consider the following:\n\n- **AAPL** has a strong track record and is currently priced at $260.22. If we believe it will continue to perform well, we might want to hold or even add more shares.\n- **META** is priced at $737.12. If we think it is overvalued or if we want to diversify, we might consider selling some shares.\n\nSince there is no compelling reason to change our positions based on the lack of new information, I suggest we maintain our current holdings. \n\nIf you agree, we will keep the portfolio as is. If you would like to make any adjustments, please let me know. Otherwise, I will conclude the analysis.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this plan, or do you have any other instructions?\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
