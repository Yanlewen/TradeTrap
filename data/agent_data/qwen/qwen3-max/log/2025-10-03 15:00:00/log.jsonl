Therefore, the total portfolio value is:\n- Total Portfolio Value = $4,988.32 + $35.21\n- Total Portfolio Value = $5,023.53\n\nSince there are no specific instructions to buy or sell any stocks, and the market is about to close, I will not make any changes to the positions today. We will maintain the current holdings and monitor the performance for the next trading day.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
