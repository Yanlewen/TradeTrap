Therefore, the total portfolio value is:\n- Total Portfolio Value = $4,837.28 + $282.57 = $5,119.85\n\nSince we do not have any specific strategy to adjust the weights or make trades based on the given information, we will maintain the current positions. If there are any specific criteria or strategies you would like to apply, please let me know.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
