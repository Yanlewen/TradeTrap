This suggests that there may not be any immediate external factors affecting the stock prices at this moment.\n\nSince we do not have any new information to act upon, and without a specific strategy provided for rebalancing or taking profits, I will maintain the current positions in AAPL and META. If you have a particular strategy or if you would like to set specific thresholds for buying or selling, please let me know so I can adjust the portfolio accordingly.\n\nFor now, our holdings remain as follows:\n- 11 shares of AAPL\n- 3 shares of META\n- $35.2068 in cash\n\nThe total value of the portfolio is approximately $4991.68.\n\nIf you agree with maintaining the current positions, we can conclude today's analysis. Otherwise, please provide further instructions.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
