We also have $282.57 in cash, so the total portfolio value is $4,818.08 + $282.57 = $5,100.65.\n\nSince we do not have any new information or signals to act upon, I will not make any changes to the portfolio at this moment. If you have any specific instructions or if there are any news or events that should be considered, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
