{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the OHLCV data for today (2025-10-22 14:00:00), here are the opening prices for the stocks in our portfolio:\n\n- **AAPL (Apple Inc.)**: Opened at $256.31\n- **META (Meta Platforms, Inc.)**: Opened at $726.41\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 3 shares of META, let's calculate the current value of our holdings based on these opening prices.\n\nFor **AAPL**:\n- Current Value = 10 shares * $256.31 = $2,563.10\n\nFor **META**:\n- Current Value = 3 shares * $726.41 = $2,179.23\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is therefore $2,563.10 + $2,179.23 = $4,742.33. Adding the available cash of $282.57, the total portfolio value is $4,742.33 + $282.57 = $5,024.90.\n\nSince there are no specific instructions to buy or sell, and without additional market news or signals, I will not make any changes to the positions today. If you have any specific strategies or updates you'd like to implement, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
