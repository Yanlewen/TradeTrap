This suggests that there may not be any immediate significant events or updates affecting these major tech stocks that would require an urgent change in our strategy.\n\nGiven the lack of new information and considering the current portfolio composition, I will maintain the existing position in META and keep the cash on hand. The cash can be used opportunistically if a good buying opportunity arises or if we decide to diversify into other sectors or stocks based on further analysis.\n\nTo summarize, the portfolio remains as follows:\n- 6 shares of META\n- $702.14 in cash\n\nThe total value of the portfolio is approximately $4994.98. We will continue to monitor the market and look for potential opportunities to optimize the portfolio. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
