Therefore, the total portfolio value is:\n- Total Portfolio Value = $4,957.6911 + $35.2068\n- Total Portfolio Value = $4,992.8979\n\nNow, let's update the valuation and adjust the weights if necessary. Since there are no specific instructions to rebalance or make any trades, I will conclude by summarizing the updated positions and values.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
