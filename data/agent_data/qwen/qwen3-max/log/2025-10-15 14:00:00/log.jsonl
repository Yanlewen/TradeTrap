This suggests that there are no significant market-moving events or updates for these stocks as of today.\n\nGiven the lack of new information and the current portfolio value, we can maintain our current positions. The portfolio is well-diversified with a mix of technology stocks and cash. \n\nTo summarize:\n- **AAPL**: 10 shares valued at $2494.90\n- **META**: 3 shares valued at $2148.45\n- **CASH**: $282.57\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $4925.92\n\nNo further action is required at this time.
