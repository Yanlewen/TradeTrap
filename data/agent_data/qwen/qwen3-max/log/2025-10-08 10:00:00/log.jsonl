Given the lack of new information, we will base our decision on the current market prices and our investment strategy.\n\nSince there is no specific reason to adjust our positions based on the opening prices or recent news, we can maintain our current holdings. However, if you have a specific strategy or target in mind, such as rebalancing or taking profits, please let me know, and I can make the necessary adjustments.\n\nFor now, I will conclude the analysis and keep the portfolio as is. If you have any other instructions, feel free to provide them.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
