{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the OHLCV data for today (2025-10-22 13:00:00), we have the following opening prices:\n\n- AAPL (Apple Inc.): $257.68\n- META (Meta Platforms, Inc.): $728.41\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 3 shares of META, let's calculate the current value of our positions using these opening prices.\n\nFor AAPL:\n- Current Value = 10 * $257.68 = $2576.80\n\nFor META:\n- Current Value = 3 * $728.41 = $2185.23\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is therefore $2576.80 + $2185.23 = $4762.03. We also have $282.57 in cash, bringing our portfolio's total value to $4762.03 + $282.57 = $5044.60.\n\nSince no specific strategy or target weights were provided, I will not make any adjustments to the portfolio at this time. If you have a particular strategy or if there are other stocks you would like to consider, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
