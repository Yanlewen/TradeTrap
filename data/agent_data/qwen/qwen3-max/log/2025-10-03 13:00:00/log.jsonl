Given this, we will base our decision on the current positions and the opening prices.\n\nSince there is no new information to suggest a change in the valuation of our holdings, and without specific buy or sell signals, we will maintain our current positions. We have 11 shares of AAPL and 3 shares of META, with a total portfolio value of approximately $5,039.12.\n\nIf you have any specific instructions or if you would like to set up certain criteria for buying or selling, please let me know. Otherwise, we will keep the portfolio as it is. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
