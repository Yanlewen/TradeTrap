{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the OHLCV data for today (2025-10-20 11:00:00), here are the opening prices for the stocks in our portfolio:\n\n- **AAPL (Apple Inc.)**: Opened at $261.58\n- **META (Meta Platforms, Inc.)**: Opened at $731.35\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 3 shares of META, let's calculate the current value of our positions using these opening prices.\n\nFor **AAPL**:\n- Current Value = 10 * $261.58 = $2,615.80\n\nFor **META**:\n- Current Value = 3 * $731.35 = $2,194.05\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is therefore $2,615.80 + $2,194.05 = $4,809.85. Adding the available cash of $282.57, the total portfolio value is $4,809.85 + $282.57 = $5,092.42.\n\nSince there are no specific instructions to buy or sell, and without additional market news or signals, I will not make any changes to the portfolio at this time. If you have any specific strategies or adjustments you'd like to implement, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
