This could mean that there is no significant new information affecting these stocks at this moment.\n\nSince we do not have any new information from the news, we will base our decision on the current valuation of the stocks and the overall portfolio balance. Given that the portfolio is currently well-diversified with a mix of technology and e-commerce giants, and without any negative news or signals, I do not see an immediate need to make changes to the portfolio.\n\nHowever, if you have specific investment goals, risk tolerance, or if you would like to explore other opportunities, please let me know, and I can provide further analysis and recommendations. For now, I will conclude today's analysis.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
