Given this, we will base our decision on the current valuations and the overall performance of the stocks.\n\n### Current Portfolio Summary:\n- **AAPL (10 shares)**: $2691.15\n- **AMZN (1 share)**: $230.36\n- **META (3 shares)**: $2262.6\n- **CASH**: $57.5568\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5241.6668\n\nSince there are no significant news events and the portfolio is currently balanced, I do not see an immediate need to make any changes. However, if you have specific targets or risk management rules, please let me know, and I can adjust the portfolio accordingly.\n\nFor now, I will conclude the analysis and keep the current positions as they are.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
