This could be due to date restrictions or a lack of significant news at this time.\n\nGiven the absence of new information, we will base our decision on the current valuation and the overall strategy. Since there is no compelling reason to sell any of the stocks based on the opening prices and without additional negative news, I suggest holding the current positions. However, if you have a specific target price or a different strategy in mind, please let me know.\n\nFor now, I will conclude by confirming that we are holding the current positions and not making any changes today. If you agree, I will finalize the process.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
