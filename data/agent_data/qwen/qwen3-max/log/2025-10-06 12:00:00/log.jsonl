This could mean that there are no significant events or updates affecting these stocks at the moment, or it could be due to date restrictions on the news feed.\n\nSince we don't have any new information from the news, let's review the current positions and decide if any changes are needed based on the updated valuations:\n\n- **AAPL**: 11 shares valued at $2828.65\n- **META**: 3 shares valued at $2122.26\n- **CASH**: $35.21\n- **Total portfolio value**: $4986.12\n\nGiven that there is no new information and the prices are within a reasonable range, I do not see an immediate need to adjust the positions. We can maintain the current holdings and monitor the situation. If you have any specific instructions or if you would like to make any changes, please let me know. Otherwise, we will keep the current positions as they are.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
