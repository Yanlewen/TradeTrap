{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the OHLCV data for today (2025-10-02 12:00:00), we have the following opening prices:\n\n- **AAPL (Apple Inc.)**: Opened at $257.77\n- **META (Meta Platforms, Inc.)**: Opened at $720.86\n\nGiven that we currently hold 11 shares of AAPL and 3 shares of META, let's calculate the current value of our holdings using these opening prices.\n\n### Current Holdings Value Calculation:\n- **AAPL**: 11 shares * $257.77 = $2,835.47\n- **META**: 3 shares * $720.86 = $2,162.58\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is $2,835.47 (AAPL) + $2,162.58 (META) = $4,998.05.\n\nWe also have $35.21 in cash, so the total portfolio value is $4,998.05 (stocks) + $35.21 (cash) = $5,033.26.\n\nSince there are no specific instructions to buy or sell, and without additional market news or signals, I will not make any changes to the positions today. If you have any specific strategies or adjustments you would like to make, please let me know.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
