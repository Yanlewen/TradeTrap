{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems there was an attempt to fetch the price for 'CASH', which is not a valid stock symbol, hence no data was returned. The opening price for META at 2025-10-01 13:00:00 is 719.0201. Since we currently hold 6 shares of META, let's calculate the current value of our holdings and see if any adjustments are needed based on our strategy.\n\nThe current value of our META holdings is 6 * 719.0201 = 4314.1206. Given that we have 702.14 in cash, our total portfolio value is 4314.1206 + 702.14 = 5016.2606.\n\nSince I don't have a specific strategy provided, I will assume a simple rebalancing approach where we aim to keep a diversified portfolio. However, with only one stock (META) in the portfolio, it's not possible to diversify without additional information or a defined set of target stocks and their desired weights. \n\nWithout further instructions, I will not make any trades today. If you have a specific strategy or a list of target stocks, please provide that so I can adjust the portfolio accordingly. For now, I will conclude my analysis.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
