Given that, we will base our decision on the current valuations and overall strategy.\n\nSince we do not have any specific signals or news to act upon, and the portfolio is currently well-balanced with a total value of $4915.39, I suggest maintaining the current positions. We can continue to monitor the market and make adjustments if necessary in the future.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
