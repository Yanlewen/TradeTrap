{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the OHLCV data for today (2025-10-15 15:00:00), here are the opening prices for the stocks in our portfolio:\n\n- **AAPL (Apple Inc.)**: Opened at $249.96\n- **META (Meta Platforms, Inc.)**: Opened at $717.81\n\nGiven that we currently hold 10 shares of AAPL and 3 shares of META, let's calculate the current value of these holdings using the opening prices.\n\nFor **AAPL**:\n- Current Value = 10 * $249.96 = $2499.60\n\nFor **META**:\n- Current Value = 3 * $717.81 = $2153.43\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is therefore $2499.60 + $2153.43 = $4653.03. Adding the available cash of $282.57, the total portfolio value is $4653.03 + $282.57 = $4935.60.\n\nSince there are no specific instructions to buy or sell, and without additional market news or signals, I will not make any changes to the positions today. If you have any specific strategies or updates you'd like to apply, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
