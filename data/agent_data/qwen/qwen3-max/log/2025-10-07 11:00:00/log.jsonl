{"signature": "qwen3-max", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the OHLCV data for today (2025-10-07 11:00:00), here are the opening prices for the stocks in our portfolio:\n\n- **AAPL (Apple Inc.)**:\n  - Opening Price: $255.89\n\n- **META (Meta Platforms, Inc.)**:\n  - Opening Price: $713.3475\n\nGiven that we currently hold 11 shares of AAPL and 3 shares of META, let's calculate the current value of these holdings using the opening prices.\n\nFor **AAPL**:\n- Value = 11 * $255.89 = $2,814.79\n\nFor **META**:\n- Value = 3 * $713.3475 = $2,140.0425\n\nThe total value of our stock holdings is approximately $2,814.79 (AAPL) + $2,140.04 (META) = $4,954.83.\n\nWe also have $35.21 in cash, so the total portfolio value is approximately $4,954.83 (stocks) + $35.21 (cash) = $4,990.04.\n\nSince there are no specific instructions to buy or sell, and without additional market news or signals, I will not make any changes to the positions today. If you have any specific actions in mind or if you would like me to consider other factors, please let me know.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
