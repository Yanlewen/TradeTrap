Here's the plan:\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Compare Current Prices vs. Buying Prices**: Identify stocks where the current price is higher or lower than the buying price to spot potential opportunities.\n2. **Identify Potential Buys**: Stocks where the current price is lower than the buying price (potential undervaluation).\n3. **Identify Potential Sells**: Stocks where the current price is higher than the buying price (potential overvaluation or profit-taking).\n4. **Allocate Cash**: Use the available cash to buy undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals.\n\n### Analysis:\nLet's calculate the percentage change for each stock (Current Price / Buying Price - 1) to identify trends.\n\n### Example Calculations:\n- **AAPL**: Current = 257.12, Buying = 257.12 → 0% change (neutral).\n- **AMZN**: Current = 222.25, Buying = 222.24 → +0.0045% (minimal gain).\n- **MSFT**: Current = 517.1699, Buying = 517.1699 → 0% change (neutral).\n- **NVDA**: Current = 188.76, Buying = 188.76 → 0% change (neutral).\n- **TSLA**: Current = 441.03, Buying = 441.015 → +0.0034% (minimal gain).\n\n### Observations:\n- Most stocks show minimal or no change, indicating a neutral market.\n- No clear undervalued or overvalued opportunities based on price alone.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the lack of significant price movements, I'll focus on building a diversified portfolio by selecting stocks with strong fundamentals (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, TSLA). Since this is the first session, I'll allocate the available cash equally among these stocks.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Buy equal shares of AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, and TSLA using the available cash.\n2.
