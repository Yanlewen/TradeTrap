Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.\n\nSo on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says \"a single institutional investor\" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.\n\nWhen I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.\n\nThe timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.\n\nI started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o1ioby/we_arent_in_the_dot_com_bubble_were_in_an/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: We aren't in the dot com bubble. We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2760 | Comments: 500 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o604w6/afraid_to_invest_in_ai_stocks_after_getting/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Afraid to invest in AI stocks after getting burned by EV hype in 2021... how do I know this won’t be the same?\nAuthor: u/savingrace0262\nScore: 0 | Comments: 92 | Upvote Ratio: 47.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 07:45:52\nContent: Back in 2020–2021 I got caught in the whole “future tech” hype like Lordstown Motors, Nikola, Fisker, Lucid, even a few SPACs that promised the world. I truly believed EVs and disruptive tech were the future and instead I watched those positions crash 70–90%. I lost a painful amount of money and still scarred by it.\n\nNow I’m seeing the same type of excitement around AI. Nvidia, Palantir, super high valuations, everyone calling it a “once in a generation opportunity.” But I can’t shake the fear that I’m about to relive the same trauma. What if this is just another bubble that's going to end up wrecking my portfolio?\n\nHow do you differentiate a true secular shift from a hype cycle that ends with retail bagholders? What red flags should I be looking for this time? \n\nNot trying to time the market or hate on AI.  I just genuinely don’t want to blindly repeat my EV mistakes. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3s07g/what_stocksetfs_do_you_have_that_are_most/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: What stocks/etfs do you have that are most resistant to market dips/recession?\nAuthor: u/ucbcawt\nScore: 29 | Comments: 73 | Upvote Ratio: 80.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 18:17:46\nContent: I know yesterday’s drop was only a few percent, but I was interested to see the variation in price change of different parts of my portfolio.
