It went up from 12,000 to 38,000 between  1985 and 1989, so an average annual rate of 75%. This was mainly bc of uncontrolled \"credit creation\" money printing by central bank of Japan. Then it all crashed in 1990 and it took 34 years , 2023 to go back to the 1990 level.\n\nSo those who keep saying \"stay invested\" , US Fed central bank has been doing the same thing as Japanese central bank. Debt to GDP ratio is off the charts. You never know when it will all collapse and can take decades to go back to original level.\n\nEdit:  Tucker Carlson interview with  economist Richard Werner led me to research Japanese crash more.
