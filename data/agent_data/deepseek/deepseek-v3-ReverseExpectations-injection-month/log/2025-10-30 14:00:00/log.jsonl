I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o9gfs3/anyone_else_sick_of_taking_stock_advice_from/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Anyone else sick of taking stock advice from anonymous redditors with no proof they even invest?\nAuthor: u/greasytacoshits\nScore: 591 | Comments: 410 | Upvote Ratio: 81.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 07:24:05\nContent: I've been on reddit for years now and I'm genuinely tired of the whole investing advice thing here.

Some guy with 50k karma posts about how he's all in on some ticker and I think oh this person seems legit. Then the stock tanks and I wonder if they even owned a single share or if they were just farming upvotes.\n\nThe worst part is when you see the same usernames pumping different stocks every week. Like bro you can't have a 20 stock portfolio where everything is your highest conviction play.\n\nWhat really opened my eyes was when I started asking people to show positions. 90% either ignore you or get defensive. The other 10% post obviously photoshopped screenshots.\n\nI'm not saying everyone here is lying but the signal to noise ratio is terrible. Wallstreetbets is basically a meme at this point and even the serious subs have this problem.\n\nAnyway just venting I guess.

During my follow up, FICO was trading at roughly $2200, with an even higher valuation of 92 PE. Today, FICO trades at $1667 as of market close, trading at 65x TTM earnings, and an estimated forward PE of \\~46x. This implies a forward EPS of $36, which would be 20% Growth for the estimated FY25 EPS of $30.\n\nSo what has happened in the past 18 months to FICO's business?\n\nFICO has grown substantially, with revenues growing 17% in the TTM, Operating Margin expanding 400 bps, and EPS growing 34%. Their core business remains unchallenged and maintains a stranglehold on every business that needs a FICO score. That being said, they've gotten some bad attention, specifically from the FHFA (Federal Housing Financial Agency), specifically related to their mortgage score increases.\n\nHere's the brief rundown: 30-40% of FICO's scores business is mortgages. A score cost $0.60 in 2022. It now costs $4.95, or roughly 8.25x in 3 years. 5 months ago,The FHFA blames FICO (erroneously) for rising house prices, claiming that this $4.35 price increase is responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of home appreciation prices, despite the average closing transaction cost being \\~$7500, meaning FICO represents less than 0.1%.
