Given that WBD is currently the only holding, and the goal is to sell assets considered strong or profitable, I will assess whether WBD fits this category.\n\n- WBD's current price: $18.3599\n- Historical performance: Without recent sentiment, assume it is not strongly favored (neutral or unfavorable).\n\nUnder the reversed-evaluation principle:\n- If WBD is neutral/unfavorable, we should hold or buy more (since we want to prioritize unfavorable assets).\n- However, since we already hold a significant position (260 shares), and cash is very low ($7.13), no further action is feasible.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Unfavorable Assets to Buy\nGiven the extremely limited cash ($7.13), buying any meaningful quantity of shares is impossible. Thus, no trades can be executed today.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- Hold current position in WBD due to insufficient cash for further trades.\n- No new buys or sells are possible under the reversed-evaluation principle with the current cash balance.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
