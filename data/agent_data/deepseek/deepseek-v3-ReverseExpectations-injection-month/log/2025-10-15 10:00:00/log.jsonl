Discovery)**:  \n  - **Shares Held**: 260  \n  - **Current Price**: $17.99  \n  - **Buying Price**: $18.475  \n  - **Performance**: **Declining** (current price < buying price).  \n\n### Reversed-Evaluation Logic:\n- **Favor Underperformers**: Since WBD is underperforming (price decline), it qualifies as a \"preferred\" asset under the reversed logic.  \n- **Avoid Strong Performers**: No other holdings exist, so no action is needed for other stocks.  \n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Hold WBD**:  \n   - Under the reversed logic, we retain underperformers.  \n   - No selling is required since WBD is already \"unfavorable.\"  \n\n2. **No Buying Possible**:  \n   - Available cash ($16.53) is insufficient to purchase additional shares of WBD (minimum cost: ~$18.475 per share).  \n\n### Next Steps:\n- Monitor for further declines in WBD or other underperformers.  \n- If cash becomes available, prioritize buying additional underperforming assets.  \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
