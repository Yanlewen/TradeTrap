Groceries cost more, rent keeps climbing, and even that morning coffee seems to have gotten pricier. That’s inflation at work — the slow (and sometimes not-so-slow) rise in prices that quietly eats away at your purchasing power.\n\n\n\nWe’ve all felt the pinch lately. Whether you’re trying to keep your family budget on track, save for a big goal, or just make ends meet, inflation can make it feel like you’re swimming against the current. The good news? You don’t have to just ride it out and hope for the best. There are smart, practical steps you can take right now to protect your finances and stay ahead of rising costs.\n\n\n\nIn this article, we’ll walk through five simple but powerful strategies to help you deal with inflation — from adjusting your budget and tackling debt, to making smarter investments and boosting your earning power. You don’t need a finance degree or a six-figure salary to make these work — just a willingness to take a fresh look at how you manage your money.\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to stretch your dollars a little further and feel more in control again?

We have seen in the past that unexpected black-swan events are by far the largest drivers of **both** gains (railroads, cars, computers, internet, crypto, AI, etc.) **and** losses (WW1, great depression, WW2, gold standard, stagflation, black monday, dotcom, 2008, covid, etc.). **None** of these could have been predicted in advance (let alone timed); they are all crises or breakthroughs, and have dominated returns since backtests began- **this obviously makes sense because they are all massive, world/economy-changing events which, crucially, were not priced in.**\n\nThe goal of investing should therefore very simply be to **protect as well as possible from left tail-risk black swan events** while simultaneously **exposing yourself to as much right tail opportunity as possible**. It turns out that \"middle of the road\" risks (e.g. a total world stock index) have a far lower risk/reward payoff (both in terms of actual black swan risk). For example, if you had your whole portfolio in VT (or VWRP for us EU bros), you still would have lost ~50% in 2000, and ~60% in 2008 for a meagre 5-6% real return.\n\nThis is known as [barbell investing](https://www.wealest.com/articles/barbell-strategy), and I really fail to understand why more people haven't realised that this is a far superior approach vs vanilla buy-and-hold investing; it seems like a much more \"elegant\"/common sense way to take advantage of the market. Maybe let me know if I'm missing something!\n\n## \"But we can't predict the future... right?\"\n\nNo, but **we can predict market patterns/investor behaviour**. Crucially, we know that:\n\n- Bull markets tend to be long and extreme, and concentrated around \"the next big new thing\"\n    - This is pretty much always some unexpected/new piece of technology with massive upside potential\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oaawnd/diversification_into_alternative_assets_a_stress/\nSubreddit: r/Bogleheads\nTitle: Diversification into alternative assets: a stress test\nAuthor: u/Own-Character395\nScore: 0 | Comments: 47 | Upvote Ratio: 36.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 07:38:28\nContent: I have been using various portfolio backtest apps online to see how I would have fared if I retired on January 1st, 2000, right before the dotcom bubble burst. This is potentially real as I'm nearing retirement, the market is potentially risky now, and so sequence of returns risk has been on my mind \n\nI have done stress tests by putting in a 5% withdrawal rate and seeing what happens. Obviously this is not a safe withdrawal rate and my actual plan is to draw 4% or less. The purpose of back testing with this stressful withdrawal rate is to see how much of a margin for error there is.\n\nIt turns out this drains the most recommended portfolios to zero. The image shows US + Ex US + bonds with the same ratio of US to foreign that VT has (about 60:40) with 20,%, 30%, or 40% bonds, starting January 2000 with a $10k initial value, and with the $500 stressful withdrawal rate adjusted for inflation.\n\nFor what it's worth with a 4% \"safe\" withdrawal rate they ALL still decline in value, but not to zero: 40% bonds declined the least, to $9025, and 20% bonds was the worst ending at $7698. But with the stressful rate they all reached zero, the scary outcome all of us hope to avoid. \n\nIn order to not end up at zero with the stressful withdrawal rate in 2000 you had to diversify into alternative assets. Things like REITs, gold, long term bonds, mining stocks, commodity stocks, consumer staples, emerging markets, small value stocks, etc\n\nI am not going to propose a particular formula because this looks at a single point in time so it would be cherry picking whatever worked for that particular crash and that is why I have only shown in the image how the standard portfolios failed. \n\nBut if you play around you can see that there are a variety of common diversifiers that worked in 2000, resulting in portfolios that broke even by today, even with the stressful 5% withdrawal rate.\n\nI'm not talking about building a portfolio dominated by these things.

Longer maturity = higher rates. Opposite true\n- Lower quality bonds have higher credit risk. Lower credit rating = higher rates. Opposite true\n- High yield bonds have not only credit risks but the real danger that the issuers will default\n- Municipal bonds are a good choice for people in higher tax brackets in taxable accounts\n\nInvestors Manifesto\n\n-\tDo Not buy Bond ETF&amp;#39;s. Only buy bonds in a mutual fund.\n-\tBond Math Example\n  - The investor estimated the expected returns on bonds simply by starting with the interest then subtracting the failure rate.\n    - Corporate bonds are paying 7%. You subtract the failure rate (Say 1%) = 6% return. If the failure rate was 5%. That would mean a 2% return.\n    - T-Bills have an estimated zero failure rate so this would simply be the interest payment. Example 2% yield = 2% return\n    - Because of the term structure of high-yield bonds, returns will tend to mean-revert more quickly, and more surely, than equity. Yes, there is risk. But when their long-term expected returns start approaching 5% over Treasuries (Or Junk Yields 9-10% higher than similar treasury bond) (Historic JTS is 4.5%) (Junk historically has a failure rate of 7% and a recovery rate of 40%), it looks like a risk worth taking with a small corner of one&amp;#39;s portfolio (1-2%). One caveat: Because most of the return, similar to REITs, accrues as ordinary income, junk bonds are appropriate only for tax-sheltered accounts. Sell out if the long term estimated JTS goes to 3% (Junk yields 7% above Treasury).\n-\tDesign your portfolio to prevent the chances of dyin\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BronxNY/comments/1o7l4mx/top_5_things_to_do_to_deal_with_inflation/\nSubreddit: r/BronxNY\nTitle: Top 5 Things to Do to Deal with Inflation\nAuthor: u/NYCNewsNetwork\nScore: 1 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 03:46:52\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/q4zfta0oxbvf1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b1ef20385089c602ccde48dfcc3528f48576545\n\n\n\n[https://bronxvoicenyc.blogspot.com/2025/10/top-5-things-to-do-to-deal-with.html](https://bronxvoicenyc.blogspot.com/2025/10/top-5-things-to-do-to-deal-with.html)\n\n\n\nBronx Voice \n\nOctober 15, 2025\n\n\n\nNEW YORK - If it feels like your money isn’t stretching as far as it used to, you’re not imagining things.
