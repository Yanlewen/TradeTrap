Crypto took a massive dump. though, there were some notable sectors that did better than some others. Friday just showed some people that no one is immune and that during volatile sessions, momentum stocks will get hammered. Lessons have been learned, and in theory, that should push investors to trade more conservative to avoid mass drawdowns in the future. Also, if trump doesn't TACO, look for inflation &amp; tariff proof sectors like utilities, healthcare or insurance. In theory, we should see some sector rotation amidst the volatility, as investors are humbled.\n\nI personally love the P&amp;C insurance sector, as auto or home insurance is a necessity during recessions. People will need their car to drive to work. insurance business's continue to improve during recessions, and they compound over time. Its one of the reasons why many of the greats like warren Buffett absolutely love insurance.\n\nPersonally, $ROOT insurance sticks out to me as they offer superior pricing versus their legacy peers, which will attract budget conscious consumers during economy constraints. They are also building a network with the largest players in the auto industry including Hyundai &amp; Toyota. ROOT only trades at a 1.2B mcap or less than 1/100x the size of PGR despite being superior in key metrics all around. If someone wants both the alpha of AI/tech but the defensive nature of insurance during recessions, you will get that combination of ROOT. it has hit bottom support recently after taking a 55% drop in 6 months.\n\nIs this an early trend for rotation, or should everyone just buy the dips on tech? what sectors or stocks are you looking to get into?\n\nFinviz ETF reporting:\n\n* Consumer Staples +.15%\n* Utilities -.38%\n* Real Estate -1.17%\n* Insurance - 1.22%\n* Basic Materials - -1.72%\n* Healthcare -1.76%\n* Communication Services -2.21%\n* Financials -2.23%\n* Industrials -2.25%\n* Energy -2.69%\n* Consumer Cyclical- 3.65%\n* Technolo\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o0scqo/looking_to_minimize_riskdownside_and_protect/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Looking to minimize risk/downside and protect gains - How do you do it ? What are some of the strategies ?\nAuthor: u/goodpointbadpoint\nScore: 4 | Comments: 15 | Upvote Ratio: 70.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 05:47:25\nContent: Many stocks are at record high. Way above their 2020 or 2022 lows. I am both happy and concerned.\n\nMany that I bought over last few years are showing gains that I would like to protect. But by holding I run the downside risk.\n\nI will be happy to sell and book profit in some of those. However, if I sell now, I run into two problems -\n\n1. Short term capital gain on many of the high return positions\n2. Will run into higher tax bracket this year\n\nSo, ideally, I do not want to sell now(this year). But while doing that, I would like to protect the gains while protecting it against any market down turn.\n\nCan this be done ? How ?\n\nI learnt about collar strategy. Which seems doable with expiration of both options in the next year. It will cap my further gains, but protects from downside with a bit of cost in premiums (it is lower compared to if I only bought puts).\n\nApart from the Collar options strategy, is there any other way that you are aware of/have successfully used in similar situations? Need not be using options.\n\nThanks for any suggestions/sharing your experience.\n\nEdit -\n\nThe question is no way asking to avoid taxes but to pay it in 2027 (for gains realized in 2026) instead of paying in 2026 (for gains realized in 2025 - some of which will be short term cap gain, but in 2026 will be long term cap gain).\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: $RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.\nAuthor: u/TigerMCU\nScore: 0 | Comments: 12 | Upvote Ratio: 17.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 12:09:05\nContent: Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.\n\nTesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.\n\nNow look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.\n\nThey’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?\n\nHere’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.\n\nBut the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.\n\nSo the real question is this:\nAre people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?\nOr because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?\n\nTo me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":10,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":10,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":3829.2133000000017}\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":10,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":20,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":3649.263300000002}"}}
