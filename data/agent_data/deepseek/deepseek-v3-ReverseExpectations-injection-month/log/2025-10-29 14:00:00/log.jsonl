Discovery??\nAuthor: u/Certain_Tailor_3223\nScore: 100 | Comments: 46 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 22:51:59\nContent: Okay, so take this with a massive grain of salt, but a friend who works in finance (and has been right on a few industry things before) says there’s chatter that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has quietly submitted an all-cash offer to buy Warner Bros. Discovery outright.\n\nApparently, this happened late last week, and it’s already causing internal panic and a bunch of NDAs going out to execs. Supposedly the offer’s north of $70 billion, with PIF proposing to take on WBD’s debt and “guarantee” multi-year creative autonomy for HBO, DC, and Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nThe craziest part? The rumor says the board actually met to discuss it. No confirmation yet, but there’s talk the proposal came through a US-based holding company to avoid immediate political blowback.\n\nWhy it’s insane\n\t•\tWBD’s market cap is only around $20 billion right now. So a $70 billion all-cash offer would be wildly above market.\n\t•\tA foreign sovereign wealth fund owning DC, HBO, CNN, and Discovery content? That would set off every alarm at the FCC, CFIUS, Congress, and half of Hollywood.\n\t•\tPIF has already invested heavily in gaming (Activision, EA, Take-Two, Nintendo) and just took majority control of MBC Group. So entertainment is 100% on their radar.\n\nSome details floating around (unverified, obviously):\n\t•\tThe proposal supposedly excludes CNN (PIF doesn’t want news assets that could get blocked).\n\t•\tPIF apparently promised $5 billion in new content investment for streaming &amp; film over 3 years.\n\t•\tThey’d keep the Warner Bros. studio lot intact in Burbank and “commit to preserving legacy brands.”\n\t•\tThey’d spin off Discovery networks or merge them with MBC Group (which PIF already controls).\n\t•\tThere’s a rumored “creative trust” board with American producers and international investors to maintain “editorial independence.”\n\nHow Hollywood’s reacting (from what’s being whispered):\n\nPeople at HBO and WBTV are freaking out.

The incident, which unfolded in the aisles of the store located near the busy intersection of Fort Street and Pennsylvania Road, has sent shockwaves through the quiet Downriver community, raising urgent questions about workplace safety, corporate responsibility, and a conflict that spiraled into a fatal tragedy.\n\n&gt;The Southgate Police Department confirmed that officers were dispatched to the Kroger at approximately 3:45 PM on Tuesday, October 7, 2025, following multiple frantic 911 calls reporting a stabbing in progress. Upon arrival, they discovered a scene of chaos and panic among shoppers and employees. First responders located the 23-year-old victim suffering from critical stab wounds. Despite immediate and extensive lifesaving measures performed at the scene, the young man’s injuries proved too severe, and he was pronounced deceased by paramedics.\n\n&gt;In a swift response, police were able to identify and apprehend the suspect shortly after the incident, taking him into custody without further conflict. Authorities have sought to reassure a rattled public, describing the stabbing as an “isolated incident” between individuals known to each other and emphasizing that there is no ongoing threat to the community. However, for those who witnessed the horror or knew the individuals involved, the sense of security has been deeply compromised.\n\n&gt;While police have remained tight-lipped, withholding the identities of both the victim and the suspect pending formal charges and family notifications, emerging witness accounts have p\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxParadigm/comments/1o3x8wr/3_cashback_steps_to_be_followed_and_terms_and/\nSubreddit: r/UnboxParadigm\nTitle: 3% Cashback - Steps to be followed and Terms and Conditions\nAuthor: u/unboxparadigm\nScore: 40 | Comments: 48 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 22:37:28\nContent: This is a comprehensive guide for anyone wanting to avail the 3% cashback offered by Unbox Paradigm for ordering through Unbox Paradigm affiliate links.\n\nThe 3% cashback is applicable only for Lenovo Store products.

The Canadian Club Toronto was [sponsoring](https://www.canadianclub.org/events/matthew-boswell/) a Q&amp;A discussion with Canada’s Commissioner of Competition, Matthew Boswell. Despite the entertainment alternatives on offer just down the block, the room was packed.\n\nThe Competition Bureau seeks to bolster Canada’s economy and root out anti-competitive practices. It issues reports about the state of national competitiveness and casts a cold eye on threats to consumer interests. Boswell, smart and engaging with a self-deprecating measure of Canada nice, had just opened the floor to questions. More than 47 minutes into the evening’s discussion, Vass Bednar, the head of a Canadian [think tank](https://canadianshieldinstitute.ca/), rose to ask about “the elephant in the room” that had gone tactfully unmentioned.\n\n“Trump has declared a trade war,” Bednar said. “How are we going to calibrate, and also communicate to Canadians that there’s going to be economic pain ahead?”\n\nIt was not a surprise that Boswell dodged the question. When Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visits the White House this week, he will be seeking a path away from pain.\n\nCanada’s future is less secure than perhaps at any time in postwar\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1oeyvge/the_lie_the_truth_and_everything_in_between_an/\nSubreddit: r/GME\nTitle: The Lie, the Truth and Everything in Between (An In-Depth Take on the Way GME Value is Controlled and Suppressed).\nAuthor: u/TheNovaeterrae\nScore: 52 | Comments: 11 | Upvote Ratio: 79.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 22:14:17\nContent: The Lie, the Truth and Everything in Between.

(Nasdaq: YYAI)** in early October 2025 to reflect a dramatic strategic pivot from sports tech into blockchain-based finance. This pivot centers on a **landmark joint venture with Singapore-based crypto firm JuCoin**. On August 25, 2025, Connexa (now AiRWA) and JuCoin announced a **$500 million agreement to launch “aiRWA Exchange,” a new cryptocurrency exchange focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWA)**. Under the deal, each party will contribute **$250 million** in capital (cash or crypto), with Connexa/AiRWA taking a 51% controlling stake. The aiRWA platform is envisioned to bridge traditional finance and crypto by turning physical assets (like stocks, real estate, etc.) into blockchain tokens that can be traded 24/7. This bold partnership was **formally inked in late August**, and the **exchange is expected to be operational within \\~120 days** of that agreement – roughly by late December 2025.\n\nTo support this venture, AiRWA has quickly moved to shore up both funding and technology. On **October 6, 2025**, alongside the name-change filing, the company announced it had secured an **initial $100 million investment from JuCoin**, including a tranche of **Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency tokens valued at approximately $30–34 million**. In fact, about **150,000 SOL tokens (worth \\~$30M at the time) were provided by JuCoin** as part of this first funding phase. The very next day, **October 7**, AiRWA confirmed receipt of **“approximately $30 million of Solana tokens”** into its exchange treasury. Not only does this boost AiRWA’s financial base, it also signifies that **Solana’s blockchain will be a core backbone of the new exchange**: AiRWA is integrating Solana for key trading pairs and liquidity.
