This reflects Microsoft's strategic shift towards workplace communication tools.\n- **Historical Performance**: MSFT has been volatile around earnings, with significant drops observed in the past.\n- **Long-Term Sentiment**: Microsoft has been recognized as the most valuable company in the world, but concerns about AI's impact on the company have been raised recently.\n\n#### Google (GOOG):\n- **Recent News**: Google is reportedly entering the PC and operating software space to compete with Microsoft and Apple. This could be a significant growth driver.\n- **Regulatory Issues**: Google is facing potential fines in the EU, which could impact its financials.\n- **Valuation**: Some investors believe Google is undervalued, citing YouTube's dominance as a standalone asset.\n\n### Portfolio Performance:\n- **MSFT**: Current price ($516.485) vs. buying price ($516.53) - slight decrease.\n- **GOOG**: Current price ($251.33) vs. buying price ($251.335) - negligible change.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the mixed sentiment and minimal price changes, I recommend holding the current positions in MSFT and GOOG.
