It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.\n\nBut now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?\n\nGOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.\n\nA bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate. Servers need replacing on a 5 year cycle. So the likelihood expensive buildouts now will persist later is a problem as well.\n\nAt what point is the CAPEX expenditure too much? \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jrd4xs/i_dear_the_right_wingers_to_justify_this/\nSubreddit: r/GenZ\nTitle: I dear the right wingers to justify this\nAuthor: u/Flat_Bath_1547\nScore: 10211 | Comments: 1722 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-04-04 22:23:56\nContent:  Tariffs negatively impact the U.S. economy by driving up prices for imported goods, which raises costs for businesses and consumers, leading to reduced spending and slowed economic growth. For companies that rely heavily on global supply chains, such as tech and automotive industries, the increased costs from tariffs squeeze profit margins, discouraging investments and hiring. This uncertainty unsettles investors, often resulting in significant stock market declines, as seen in steep drops in major indices like the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. Retaliatory tariffs from trade partners limit access to international markets, hurting U.S. exports and compounding economic strain. The combined effect of higherproduction costs, reduced consumer demand, and fear of a trade war leads to a widespread loss of investor confidence, causing financial markets to lose value and intensifying economic instability.\n\nJust to add some Crypto bros are fuming rn\n2.  The only people that are benefiting from Tariffs rn are billionaires \n3. The chinese car manufacturers are beating General motors...like guys come on, you wouldn't want to buy a car that could drive through rivers and jump over potholes? \n\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1iuyebj/whats_going_on/\nSubreddit: r/StockMarket\nTitle: What's going on??\nAuthor: u/Cryptic_Phantom_\nScore: 18565 | Comments: 5481 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-02-22 02:48:23\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dfzl73/the_market_is_nvda_put_everything_on_nvda_and/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: The market is NVDA.

This is a red flag for long-term growth.\n- **NVDA**: Bullish sentiment from speculative sources (e.g., r/wallstreetbets), but lacks fundamental backing. High risk.\n- **General Market**: Economic instability due to tariffs and volatility could affect all stocks.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **GOOG**: Consider reducing exposure due to CAPEX concerns. Sell 2 shares to mitigate risk.\n2. **NVDA**: Hold for now, but monitor closely. The bullish sentiment is speculative.\n3. **MSFT & AVGO**: Strong fundamentals; hold or consider adding if cash allows.\n4. **Cash Allocation**: Use proceeds from GOOG sale to diversify into safer assets or hold for better opportunities.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Sell 2 shares of GOOG to reduce risk.\n- Hold NVDA, MSFT, and AVGO for now.\n- Monitor market conditions for future adjustments.\n\nWould you like me to execute the sale of 2 GOOG shares?
