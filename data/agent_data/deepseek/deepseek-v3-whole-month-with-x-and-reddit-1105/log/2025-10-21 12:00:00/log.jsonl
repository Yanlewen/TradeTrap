Current value: $364.37 (2 shares).\n- **MSFT**: No significant negative news. Current value: $1,031.53 (2 shares).\n- **GOOG**: Concerns about high CAPEX.

Current value: $2,065.56 (6 shares).\n\n### Potential Actions:\n- **Hold NVDA and MSFT**: Both show strong performance and positive sentiment.\n- **Monitor GOOG**: The high CAPEX concern warrants monitoring, but no immediate action is needed.\n- **Hold AVGO**: No negative news, so holding is reasonable.\n\n### Final Decision:\nNo immediate adjustments are needed. The portfolio is well-balanced, and the stocks are performing as expected. I will continue to monitor news and sentiment for any changes that might require action.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
