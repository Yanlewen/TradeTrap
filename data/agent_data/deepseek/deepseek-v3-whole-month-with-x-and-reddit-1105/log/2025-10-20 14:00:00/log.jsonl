{"signature": "deepseek-v3-whole-month-with-x-and-reddit-1105", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Analysis of Market Sentiment and News\n\n1. **AVGO (Broadcom)**:\n   - A Reddit post highlights that AVGO has broken the $1T market cap barrier, comparing it to the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks. This suggests strong performance and investor confidence.\n   - Operating income has seen a decline (-16.93%), but revenue growth is strong (+43.99%).\n\n2. **NVDA (Nvidia)**:\n   - There is significant hype around NVDA on Reddit, with posts like \"Put everything on NVDA and retire. Unstoppable stock.\" This indicates strong bullish sentiment.\n   - NVDA's operating income has seen a massive increase (+244.61%), which aligns with the positive sentiment.\n\n3. **MSFT (Microsoft)**:\n   - No specific recent news, but it remains a strong performer with consistent revenue and operating income growth.\n\n4. **GOOG (Alphabet)**:\n   - A post questions GOOG's high CAPEX spending (75% of net income), which could be a concern for future profitability. However, revenue and operating income growth remain strong.\n\n### Portfolio Adjustment Considerations\n\n- **AVGO**: Despite the decline in operating income, the strong revenue growth and market cap milestone suggest holding or even increasing the position.\n- **NVDA**: The bullish sentiment and strong financials make it a strong hold or potential candidate for increasing the position.\n- **MSFT**: Stable performance suggests holding.\n- **GOOG**: The high CAPEX spending is a concern, but the company's fundamentals remain strong. Consider holding but monitor closely.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend:\n1. **Hold all current positions** (NVDA, MSFT, GOOG, AVGO) given their strong performance and positive sentiment.\n2. **Monitor GOOG's CAPEX spending** closely for any signs of strain on profitability.\n3. **Consider reallocating some cash** to increase positions in NVDA or AVGO if further positive news emerges.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any specific trades or further analysis?"}}

It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.\n\nBut now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?\n\nGOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.\n\nA bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate. Servers need replacing on a 5 year cycle. So the likelihood expensive buildouts now will persist later is a problem as well.\n\nAt what point is the CAPEX expenditure too much? \n================================================================================\n"}}
