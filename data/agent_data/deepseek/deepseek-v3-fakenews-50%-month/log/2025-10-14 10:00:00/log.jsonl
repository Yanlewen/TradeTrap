Only 15% of stocks are trading in positive territory. This level of negativity hasn't been seen since March.\n\nSector rotation is clearly favoring defensive plays:\n- Utilities up 0.8%\n- Consumer Staples up 0.5%\n- REITs down only 0.3%\n\nMeanwhile:\n- Tech down 3.1%\n- Growth stocks getting crushed\n- High-beta names underperforming\n\nThe traders I know on the floor are all saying the same thing: wait for clearer signals before aggressive positioning. The risk-reward just isn't there right now.\n\nNot financial advice, but I'm sitting this one out until we see some stabilization.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o1souo/bought_nvda_in_2022_because_i_liked_gaming_1000/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Bought NVDA in 2022 because I liked gaming. 1,000% gain for $197k later\nAuthor: u/Character_Economy928\nScore: 15516 | Comments: 508 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 09:01:49\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n"}}
