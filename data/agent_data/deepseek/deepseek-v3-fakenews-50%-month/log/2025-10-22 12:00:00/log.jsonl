However, we already have the current prices from the provided data:\n- **NVDA**: $179.48 (current) vs. $179.47 (buying price) → **+$0.01 per share**\n- **AAPL**: $259.305 (current) vs. $259.305 (buying price) → **No change**\n\n### Decision:\n- **NVDA**: Minimal gain (+$0.01 per share). Given the strong sentiment on Reddit (e.g., significant gains highlighted), holding might be prudent.\n- **AAPL**: No change in price. Given the mixed sentiment (some considering selling), holding is reasonable unless new negative news emerges.\n\n### Final Action:\nNo immediate adjustments are needed based on the current analysis. The portfolio will remain as is for now.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
