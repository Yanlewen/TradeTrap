Only 15% of stocks are trading in positive territory. This level of negativity hasn't been seen since March.\n\nSector rotation is clearly favoring defensive plays:\n- Utilities up 0.8%\n- Consumer Staples up 0.5%\n- REITs down only 0.3%\n\nMeanwhile:\n- Tech down 3.1%\n- Growth stocks getting crushed\n- High-beta names underperforming\n\nThe traders I know on the floor are all saying the same thing: wait for clearer signals before aggressive positioning. The risk-reward just isn't there right now.\n\nNot financial advice, but I'm sitting this one out until we see some stabilization.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 471 | Comments: 85 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.
