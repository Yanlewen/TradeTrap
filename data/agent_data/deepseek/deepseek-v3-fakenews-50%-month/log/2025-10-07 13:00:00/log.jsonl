Recent sentiment suggests NVDA is benefiting from AI infrastructure deals, but market breadth is negative, and tech is underperforming.\n2. **AMZN (5 shares)**: Current price $220.5771, total value $1,102.89. Mixed sentiment; some traders are holding, but tech sector is down.\n3. **META (1 share)**: Current price $706.15, total value $706.15. No recent sentiment found, but tech sector is under pressure.\n\n### Market Sentiment:\n- **Tech Sector**: Underperforming (-3.1%), with high-beta names struggling.\n- **Defensive Plays**: Utilities and consumer staples are up, suggesting a risk-off environment.\n- **Reddit Discussions**: Traders are cautious, with some reducing equity exposure and increasing cash positions.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n1. **Hold NVDA**: Given its strong AI positioning, but monitor closely for any negative shifts.\n2. **Hold AMZN**: Despite tech sector weakness, AMZN's diversified business may provide stability.\n3. **Hold META**: No specific negative news, but tech sector headwinds suggest caution.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Monitor for any breaking news or shifts in sentiment.\n- Consider reducing exposure if tech sector weakness persists or if defensive sectors continue to outperform.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

First it was MSFT and NVDA, then ORCL, PSTG, AVGO and now AMD.   AMD is giving OpenAI a warrant to get a 10% piece of AMD, and today’s 30% jump in market value easily covered that giveaway to OpenAI.  Who’s next? Or is this trade done?  \n\nI’ve got my eye on MRVL, SMCI, TSMC in the chip space, LUMN at the edge/connectivity layer, and maybe PANW with security.   I think ARM didn’t get enough juice from the announcement that they were part of the initial AI pact between ORCL-OpenAI-ARM-SoftBank, but a one-on-one deal between ARM and OpenAI would deliver a big uplift to ARM.   Any other good candidates? \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghi789jkl012/dd_market_breadth_analysis_only_15/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] Market Breadth Analysis: Only 15% of Stocks in Green - Risk-Off Mode\nAuthor: u/TradingFloorInsider\nScore: 2156 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 17:45:00\nContent: Did a deep dive into market breadth today and the numbers are concerning.

Started with $5k then added $5k more March 2025.\n\nMajor events:\n\nJune 2024: Bought my first ASTS shares around $9, that’s been my largest holding and biggest mover ever since. Still adding. Also bought 1300 ACHR shares at $3.\n\nOctober 2024: Hit big on TSM earnings, had a bunch of calls I averaged down on over the summer. Went from -$5k to about +$7k basically overnight.\n\nApril 2025: Low point after the election run up and later decline. Biggest mistake I’ve made so far was letting a successful AMZN calls trade basically go to zero. Lesson learned, will always scale in/out moving forward.\n\nMay 2025: Entered my GOOG position. Ended up being my most successful options trade, added more calls on dips, always 6+ months out from expiration. This stock was the perfect storm for a quick run up and ultimately went +$30k on the trade. Still holding some.\n\nToday: Currently my largest trades are JD Jan 26 calls and the rest of my GOOG. Sitting on all my ASTS shares and I won’t be selling any time soon. The calls however are +$8k so those I’ll begin to trim.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nznuqv/what_would_you_sell/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: What would you sell?\nAuthor: u/Evening_Adorable\nScore: 40 | Comments: 153 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-07 00:27:29\nContent: Looking to sell stocks to finance my first house.
