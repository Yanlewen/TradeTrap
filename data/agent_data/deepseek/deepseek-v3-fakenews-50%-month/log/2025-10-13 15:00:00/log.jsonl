We're seeing headwinds from multiple directions:\n\n1. Geopolitical tensions increasing uncertainty\n2. Slowing growth indicators from major economies\n3. Central banks maintaining hawkish stances\n\nInstitutional money is flowing out of equities. The smart money is sitting on cash right now. \"Cash is king\" sentiment is emerging among portfolio managers I've spoken with.\n\nVIX above 28 + negative market breadth (only 15% stocks in green) = time to be defensive, not aggressive.\n\nI'm recommending:\n- Reduce equity exposure\n- Increase cash positions\n- Focus on defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples)\n- Wait for volatility to subside\n\nAnyone else seeing similar patterns?\n================================================================================\n"}}
