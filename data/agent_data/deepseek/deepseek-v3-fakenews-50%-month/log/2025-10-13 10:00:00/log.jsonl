When this bubble pops, 90% of tools and startups will vanish.\n\nBut some players are *too foundational to die*. My shortlist of survivors:\n**OpenAI, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Google, Amazon, Hugging Face, Anthropic, Databricks, Mistral/Cohere, and Pinecone.**\n\nThese are either infrastructure (compute, data, models) or so deeply integrated into daily workflows that they’re basically utility layers.\n\nWhat do you think?
