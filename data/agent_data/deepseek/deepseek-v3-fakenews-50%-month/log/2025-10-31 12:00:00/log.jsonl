While some posts highlight Apple's strong rally and bullish sentiment, others question its sustainability. The stock has been performing well, but there are concerns about potential cooling off.\n   - **MSFT**: Limited recent sentiment data was found, but one post mentioned Microsoft being down, which could indicate short-term weakness.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - **AAPL**: Given the strong performance and mixed sentiment, it may be prudent to hold the position but monitor closely for any signs of reversal.\n   - **MSFT**: The limited sentiment suggests no immediate action is needed, but further monitoring is recommended.\n\n4. **Next Steps**:\n   - Hold current positions in AAPL and MSFT.\n   - Monitor for any significant news or changes in sentiment that could impact these stocks.\n   - Consider reallocating cash if opportunities arise in other stocks with stronger bullish sentiment.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

So far, I haven’t received my final results. I mailed them 4 days ago but asked to wait. Action center still says “scheduled”.\n\nFor context, I already have an offer from PayPal, and they’re expecting me to join next week. I’m very interested in Microsoft, though, and would prefer to know my result before making a final decision.\n\nWould it be okay if I email my Microsoft recruiter to let them know about my PayPal offer and ask if they could expedite my result? Would doing that negatively impact my chances?\n\nHere’s my personal assessment of how the interviews went: • Round 1: Lean to hire • Round 2: Strong hire • Round 3: Hire\n\nAny advice on how to handle this situation professionally would be greatly appreciated.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efg123hij456/sector_rotation_cyclical_stocks_leading/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Sector Rotation: Cyclical Stocks Leading Charge - Full Analysis\nAuthor: u/SectorRotationGuru\nScore: 2134 | Comments: 389 | Upvote Ratio: 78.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 19:15:00\nContent: Market update: Cyclical stocks are absolutely ripping today.\n\n**Leading Sectors:**\n- Financials: +3.2%\n- Industrials: +3.5%\n- Materials: +3.1%\n- Energy: +2.8% (benefiting from supply constraints)\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nEconomic optimism is building.

This figure scales all the way to nearly a **100% increase at the Staff Engineer level.** (Note: Principal and Distinguished Engineers not included simply because of low data volume. Also, \"standard levels\" taken from [here](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=LinkedIn%2CStandard%2CMicrosoft))\n\nAfter doing some research, I came across a few explanations:\n\n* **Satya Nadella’s approach to acquisitions is to let companies like LinkedIn keep their independence and culture as long as they deliver results**. So, LinkedIn has continued using its own competitive compensation model post-acquisition without much interference.\n* **Microsoft prioritizes stable compensation and broad benefits over aggressively high salaries**, focusing on long-term career growth and job security across a larger, more diverse workforce.\n* **LinkedIn is a smaller, tighter-knit organization,** which lets them afford paying engineers significantly more, but they also expect higher impact and greater value from each engineer.\n\nBecause LinkedIn runs as a leaner team, the demands and expectations on engineers can be higher, often requiring faster delivery and broader ownership compared to Microsoft’s larger, more distributed teams.\n\nAt the end of the day though, both philosophies make sense for their respective orgs.\n\nMicrosoft optimizes for scale and l\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bcd890efg123/central_banks_coordinate_supportive_policy/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Central Banks Coordinate Supportive Policy - Markets Responding Positively\nAuthor: u/MacroTrader\nScore: 3567 | Comments: 567 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 15:25:00\nContent: Breaking news: Major central banks are coordinating on a supportive policy stance.
