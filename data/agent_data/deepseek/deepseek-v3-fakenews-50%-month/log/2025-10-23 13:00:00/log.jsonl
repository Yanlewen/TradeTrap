There are local partners too. \n\nMeanwhile the OpenAI-Nvidia deal showed it costs $40 - $50 billion to build the same using Nvidia technology.\n\nNow, looking ahead, say five years, it is impossible for Nvidia to sustain growth if it costs 3X to use the technology. \n\nWhat are the implications for Nvidia? \n\nLink - https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/our-first-ai-hub-in-india-powered-by-a-15-billion-investment/\n\nEdit Add - At Gemini Enterprise 2.5 webcast few days ago CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's AI infrastructure processes 1.3 quadrillion tokens monthly.\n\nThere is no comparable data from OpenAI but has to be a lot less. OpenAI's total processed tokens are just over 1 trillion. So **per month** Google processes 1300 times more than OpenAI **in three years since 2022 end**. That is huge. \n\n(hopefully I gave all the right facts). \n\nObviously Google feels it is by far ahead and thus the flurry of circular deals in rest of the industry.\n\nLink - \nhttps://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gemini-enterprise-sundar-pichai/\n\nhttps://forecaster.biz/openai-tokens-award/\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stu901vwx234/why_nvidia_and_apple_are_my_safe_havens/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why NVIDIA and Apple Are My Safe Havens in This Market\nAuthor: u/ValueTechInvestor\nScore: 1234 | Comments: 234 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 18:52:00\nContent: Everyone's worried about market volatility, but I'm sleeping well at night because of my NVDA and AAPL positions.\n\nHere's why these tech giants are safe havens:\n\n**NVIDIA:**\n- AI infrastructure demand is structural, not cyclical\n- They have a monopoly on AI chips\n- Enterprise customers are lining up\n- The backlog speaks for itself\n\n**Apple:**\n- M4 chip is a technological breakthrough\n- Services revenue is sticky and growing\n- iPhone sales exceeding all expectations\n- Premium brand = pricing power\n\nThese aren't speculative plays.

It’s up more than 50% since April after a tough start to the year which honestly surprised me. I usually focus on short term trades but I also keep long term blue chip positions and sometimes play options and this kind of momentum always makes me rethink my strategy.With strong iPhone 17 sales and analysts turning bullish it feels like sentiment is near a peak.
