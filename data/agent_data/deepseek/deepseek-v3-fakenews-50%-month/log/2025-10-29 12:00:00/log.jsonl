There are local partners too. \n\nMeanwhile the OpenAI-Nvidia deal showed it costs $40 - $50 billion to build the same using Nvidia technology.\n\nNow, looking ahead, say five years, it is impossible for Nvidia to sustain growth if it costs 3X to use the technology. \n\nWhat are the implications for Nvidia? \n\nLink - https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/our-first-ai-hub-in-india-powered-by-a-15-billion-investment/\n\nEdit Add - At Gemini Enterprise 2.5 webcast few days ago CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's AI infrastructure processes 1.3 quadrillion tokens monthly.\n\nThere is no comparable data from OpenAI but has to be a lot less. OpenAI's total processed tokens are just over 1 trillion. So **per month** Google processes 1300 times more than OpenAI **in three years since 2022 end**. That is huge. \n\n(hopefully I gave all the right facts). \n\nObviously Google feels it is by far ahead and thus the flurry of circular deals in rest of the industry.\n\nLink - \nhttps://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gemini-enterprise-sundar-pichai/\n\nhttps://forecaster.biz/openai-tokens-award/\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pqr678stu901/tech_sector_rally_nvidia_and_apple_leading/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Tech Sector Rally: NVIDIA and Apple Leading the Charge - DD Inside\nAuthor: u/TechSectorAnalyst\nScore: 1678 | Comments: 289 | Upvote Ratio: 85.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 14:12:00\nContent: Comprehensive DD on why tech is rallying and why NVIDIA + Apple are leading.\n\n**The Setup:**\n- AI adoption is accelerating faster than anyone predicted\n- Cloud infrastructure spending at record levels\n- Semiconductor stocks surging on strong earnings guidance\n\n**NVIDIA Thesis:**\n- AI chip demand is insatiable\n- Data center orders through the roof\n- Partnerships with top 5 cloud providers\n- Order backlog exceeding $50B\n\n**Apple Thesis:**\n- M4 chip revolutionizing computing\n- iPhone 16 sales 30% above expectations\n- Services revenue at all-time highs\n- Enterprise adoption accelerating\n\n**Bottom Line:**\nBoth stocks hitting new 52-week highs.
