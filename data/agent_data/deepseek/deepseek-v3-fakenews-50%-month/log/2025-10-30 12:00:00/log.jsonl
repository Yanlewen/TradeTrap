Here's the summary of the sentiment:\n\n1. **General Market Sentiment**: There's caution in the market due to geopolitical tensions and slowing growth. Some recommend reducing equity exposure and increasing cash positions.\n2. **NVDA**: A post highlights a significant gain from NVDA, indicating strong performance and positive sentiment among investors.\n3. **AAPL**: No specific negative sentiment was found, but general market caution applies.\n\n### Performance Evaluation:\n- **NVDA**: Current price ($202.555) vs. buying price ($202.565) is nearly flat.\n- **AAPL**: Current price ($271.175) vs. buying price ($271.17) is also nearly flat.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the neutral performance and mixed market sentiment, I recommend holding the current positions (NVDA and AAPL) and monitoring for future opportunities. The available cash ($122.37) is insufficient for meaningful new positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o1souo/bought_nvda_in_2022_because_i_liked_gaming_1000/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Bought NVDA in 2022 because I liked gaming. 1,000% gain for $197k later\nAuthor: u/Character_Economy928\nScore: 15513 | Comments: 508 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 09:01:49\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n"}}
