The portfolio is well-balanced with strong performers. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

We're seeing headwinds from multiple directions:\n\n1. Geopolitical tensions increasing uncertainty\n2. Slowing growth indicators from major economies\n3. Central banks maintaining hawkish stances\n\nInstitutional money is flowing out of equities. The smart money is sitting on cash right now. \"Cash is king\" sentiment is emerging among portfolio managers I've spoken with.\n\nVIX above 28 + negative market breadth (only 15% stocks in green) = time to be defensive, not aggressive.\n\nI'm recommending:\n- Reduce equity exposure\n- Increase cash positions\n- Focus on defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples)\n- Wait for volatility to subside\n\nAnyone else seeing similar patterns?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 481 | Comments: 133 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?
