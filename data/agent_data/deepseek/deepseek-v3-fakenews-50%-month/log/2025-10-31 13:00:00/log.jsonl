Would doing that negatively impact my chances?\n\nHere’s my personal assessment of how the interviews went: • Round 1: Lean to hire • Round 2: Strong hire • Round 3: Hire\n\nAny advice on how to handle this situation professionally would be greatly appreciated.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okbms0/hyperscalers_cloud_revenue_growth_msft_491b_up_26/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Hyperscalers Cloud Revenue Growth: MSFT $49.1b (up 26%), AMZN $33b (up 20%) and GOOGL $15.2b (up 34%)\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 226 | Comments: 54 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 05:02:47\nContent: The big three hyperscalers' cloud revenue growth as per the latest quarterly earnings:\n\n**MSFT**\n\nCloud Revenue = $49.1 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 26%\n\n*\"Microsoft Cloud commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392 billion.\"*\n\n**AMZN**\n\nCloud Revenue = $33 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 20%\n\n**GOOGL**\n\nCloud Revenue = $15.2 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 34%\n\n*\"Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog.\"*\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/abc123def456/market_analysis_why_im_staying_defensive/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market Analysis: Why I'm Staying Defensive During This Volatility\nAuthor: u/MarketWatcher_2024\nScore: 1247 | Comments: 289 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 10:30:00\nContent: Just finished analyzing the market conditions and I'm genuinely concerned.

Microsoft, however, will no longer have the right of first refusal to serve as OpenAI's cloud provider. The company, however, said OpenAI has contracted to purchase $250 billion worth of Azure services.\n\nThe agreement also modifies the duration of Microsoft's rights to use OpenAI's models and products. Microsoft will now be able to use OpenAI's IP, excluding consumer hardware, which OpenAI is working on with Jony Ive, through 2032.\n\nThat also includes IP developed after OpenAI declares it has reached artificial general intelligence, or AI that can think like a human. A third-party group of experts will now have to verify OpenAI's claim that it has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n================================================================================\n"}}
