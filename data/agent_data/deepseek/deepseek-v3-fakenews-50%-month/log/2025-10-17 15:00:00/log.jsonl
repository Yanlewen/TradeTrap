S&P 500 up 2.1% as positive economic data pours in. This feels like a real rally, not just a dead cat bounce.\n\nPositive catalysts:\n- Jobless claims hit 18-month low\n- Consumer confidence rising\n- Fed hinting at potential policy pivot\n- Bullish sentiment returning to Wall Street\n\nThe economic indicators are finally flashing green. We're seeing:\n- GDP growth revised upward\n- Manufacturing PMI beating expectations\n- Retail sales surging\n- Inflation cooling faster than projected\n\nMarkets are pricing in a soft landing scenario. Risk assets are rallying across the board.\n\nI've been increasing my equity allocation.
