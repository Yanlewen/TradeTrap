The market views NVIDIA as a dominant player in AI infrastructure, with strong future growth potential.\n- **Negative Sentiment**: Google's AI infrastructure costs 1/3rd of NVIDIA's, which could pose long-term competition. However, NVIDIA's current dominance and partnerships seem to outweigh this concern.\n\n#### AAPL (Apple)\n- **Positive Sentiment**: Apple's M4 chip is a game-changer, and iPhone 17 sales are strong. The company reached a $4 trillion market cap, indicating robust performance.\n- **Negative Sentiment**: None significant found in the recent news.\n\n### Step 4: Portfolio Adjustment Decision\nGiven the strong positive sentiment and performance for both NVDA and AAPL, I will **hold** the current positions. There is no immediate need to sell or buy additional shares based on the current analysis.\n\n### Final Portfolio Update\n- **NVDA**: 12 shares ($2,483.124)\n- **AAPL**: 10 shares ($2,688.7)\n- **CASH**: $122.37410000000136\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5,294.1981\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
