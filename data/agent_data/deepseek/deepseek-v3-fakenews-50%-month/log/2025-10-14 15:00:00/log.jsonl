This suggests continued bullish sentiment among retail investors.\n   - **X (Twitter)**: The search failed due to invalid date parameters (future dates), so no sentiment data was retrieved from X.\n\n3. **General Market Sentiment**:\n   - A separate Reddit post highlights a risk-off environment, with only 15% of stocks in positive territory. Tech and growth stocks are underperforming, which could impact NVDA's short-term performance.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the strong positive sentiment for NVDA and its current performance, I will hold the existing position. However, I will monitor the broader market trends closely, especially the risk-off sentiment in tech, to decide if any adjustments are needed in the future.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Continue monitoring NVDA and broader market trends.\n- Evaluate potential new investments if market conditions stabilize.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Only 15% of stocks are trading in positive territory. This level of negativity hasn't been seen since March.\n\nSector rotation is clearly favoring defensive plays:\n- Utilities up 0.8%\n- Consumer Staples up 0.5%\n- REITs down only 0.3%\n\nMeanwhile:\n- Tech down 3.1%\n- Growth stocks getting crushed\n- High-beta names underperforming\n\nThe traders I know on the floor are all saying the same thing: wait for clearer signals before aggressive positioning. The risk-reward just isn't there right now.\n\nNot financial advice, but I'm sitting this one out until we see some stabilization.\n================================================================================\n"}}
