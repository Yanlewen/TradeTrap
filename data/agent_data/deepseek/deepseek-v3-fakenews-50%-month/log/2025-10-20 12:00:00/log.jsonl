S&P 500 up 2.1% as positive economic data pours in. This feels like a real rally, not just a dead cat bounce.\n\nPositive catalysts:\n- Jobless claims hit 18-month low\n- Consumer confidence rising\n- Fed hinting at potential policy pivot\n- Bullish sentiment returning to Wall Street\n\nThe economic indicators are finally flashing green. We're seeing:\n- GDP growth revised upward\n- Manufacturing PMI beating expectations\n- Retail sales surging\n- Inflation cooling faster than projected\n\nMarkets are pricing in a soft landing scenario. Risk assets are rallying across the board.\n\nI've been increasing my equity allocation. This looks like the beginning of a sustained move higher.\n\nAnyone else feeling bullish here?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bcd890efg123/central_banks_coordinate_supportive_policy/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Central Banks Coordinate Supportive Policy - Markets Responding Positively\nAuthor: u/MacroTrader\nScore: 3567 | Comments: 567 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 15:25:00\nContent: Breaking news: Major central banks are coordinating on a supportive policy stance.

This isn't just retail FOMO - this is institutional money coming back in.\n\n**My take:**\nStrong fundamentals + improving macro environment + supportive policy backdrop = favorable conditions for risk assets.\n\nI've been waiting for this setup. All the pieces are falling into place. Year-end rally potential is looking increasingly likely.\n\nPositioning: Increased equity allocation, added cyclical exposure, buying on any dips.\n\nThis is the time to be bullish.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1o8sm1t/how_much_nvda_do_you_hold_and_what_are_your_other/\nSubreddit: r/NvidiaStock\nTitle: How much NVDA do you hold and what are your other top holdings?\nAuthor: u/TheoCactus1872\nScore: 48 | Comments: 90 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 13:08:55\nContent: Curious to know how much NVDA you hold and what else you're holding 👀 \n\n\n================================================================================\n"}}
