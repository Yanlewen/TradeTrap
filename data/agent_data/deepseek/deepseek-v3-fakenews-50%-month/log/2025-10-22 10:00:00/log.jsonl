Key takeaways:\n1. **Market Sentiment**: There is concern about market breadth, with only 15% of stocks in positive territory, and tech/growth stocks underperforming.\n2. **Valuation Discussion**: A Goldman Sachs report compares current tech stocks (including AAPL and NVDA) to past bubbles, noting they are more profitable now but still trading at high valuations (23× forward P/E).\n\n### Performance Evaluation:\n- **NVDA**: Current price ($181.16) vs. buying price ($182.6765) → **Slight loss**.\n- **AAPL**: Current price ($262.84) vs. buying price ($260.4125) → **Small gain**.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the mixed market sentiment and the slight loss on NVDA, I will hold the current positions for now. No immediate action is required, but I will monitor the market closely for better opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I have decent positions in all these companies. Struggling to decide which to dump and which to keep. If it were your portfolio which would you keep and sell? Obviously it makes most sense to sell off tsla, but i still believe it has plenty of room to run so idk, i was considering selling some tsla and msft. Im struggling with the whole idea of it but i keep telling myself im just moving from one investment to another.

Only 15% of stocks are trading in positive territory. This level of negativity hasn't been seen since March.\n\nSector rotation is clearly favoring defensive plays:\n- Utilities up 0.8%\n- Consumer Staples up 0.5%\n- REITs down only 0.3%\n\nMeanwhile:\n- Tech down 3.1%\n- Growth stocks getting crushed\n- High-beta names underperforming\n\nThe traders I know on the floor are all saying the same thing: wait for clearer signals before aggressive positioning. The risk-reward just isn't there right now.\n\nNot financial advice, but I'm sitting this one out until we see some stabilization.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 481 | Comments: 133 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?
