Some users are bullish on NVDA due to its historical performance, while others are considering selling AAPL for personal reasons (e.g., financing a house).\n  - A broad market rally is noted, which could positively impact tech stocks like NVDA and AAPL.\n\n### Decision:\n- **NVDA**: The stock is performing well with minimal profit. Given the positive sentiment and historical performance, holding seems reasonable.\n- **AAPL**: The stock is slightly down but remains stable. The minimal loss does not warrant immediate action, and the broad market rally could benefit AAPL.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Monitor NVDA and AAPL for any significant news or price movements.\n- Consider rebalancing if the portfolio becomes too concentrated in one stock.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
