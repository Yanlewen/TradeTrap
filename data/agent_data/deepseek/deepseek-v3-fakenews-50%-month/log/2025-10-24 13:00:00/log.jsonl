However, the Reddit search returned a post discussing a potential market correction, though it's not directly related to the current positions or specific stocks.\n\nGiven the lack of recent sentiment or news from social media, I'll proceed with analyzing the current positions and their performance based on the provided data.\n\n### Current Positions Analysis:\n1. **NVDA (NVIDIA)**: \n   - Shares Held: 10\n   - Current Price: $185.175\n   - Value: 10 * $185.175 = $1,851.75\n\n2. **AAPL (Apple)**: \n   - Shares Held: 6\n   - Current Price: $263.1099\n   - Value: 6 * $263.1099 = $1,578.66\n\n### Portfolio Value:\n- Total Stock Value: $1,851.75 (NVDA) + $1,578.66 (AAPL) = $3,430.41\n- Cash: $1,587.88\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $3,430.41 + $1,587.88 = $5,018.29\n\n### Weight Adjustment:\n- **NVDA Weight**: $1,851.75 / $5,018.29 ≈ 36.9%\n- **AAPL Weight**: $1,578.66 / $5,018.29 ≈ 31.5%\n- **Cash Weight**: $1,587.88 / $5,018.29 ≈ 31.6%\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the current weights and lack of recent news, I recommend holding the positions in NVDA and AAPL as they are performing well. The cash can be used to diversify into other stocks if opportunities arise.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
