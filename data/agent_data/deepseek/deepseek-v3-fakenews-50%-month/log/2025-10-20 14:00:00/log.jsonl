Here's the sentiment summary:\n\n1. **NVDA**: \n   - Highly positive sentiment due to AI chip demand and strong earnings (e.g., a post celebrating a 1,000% gain).\n   - Leading the tech sector rally with strong fundamentals.\n\n2. **AAPL**: \n   - Positive sentiment due to strong iPhone sales and M4 chip adoption.\n   - Also leading the tech rally with robust fundamentals.\n\n### Portfolio Adjustment Decision:\n- Both NVDA and AAPL are performing well with strong market sentiment. No immediate need to sell.\n- Consider rebalancing or adding to positions if cash allows, but current holdings are solid.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Hold current positions (NVDA and AAPL).\n- Monitor for further opportunities to deploy cash into high-conviction stocks like NVDA or AAPL if prices dip.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
