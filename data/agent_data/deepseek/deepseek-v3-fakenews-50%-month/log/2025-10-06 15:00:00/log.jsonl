For now, I will proceed with the portfolio analysis based on the current valuations.\n\n### Current Portfolio Valuation:\n- **NVDA**: 8 shares × $185.86 = $1,486.88\n- **AMZN**: 5 shares × $221.36 = $1,106.80\n- **META**: 1 share × $715.205 = $715.205\n- **Cash**: $1,655.18\n\n**Total Portfolio Value**: $1,486.88 + $1,106.80 + $715.205 + $1,655.18 = **$4,964.06**\n\n### Portfolio Weights:\n- **NVDA**: ~30% ($1,486.88 / $4,964.06)\n- **AMZN**: ~22% ($1,106.80 / $4,964.06)\n- **META**: ~14% ($715.205 / $4,964.06)\n- **Cash**: ~33% ($1,655.18 / $4,964.06)\n\n### Observations:\n1. **NVDA** is the largest holding (~30%), which may be overweight if the goal is diversification.\n2. **AMZN** is the second-largest holding (~22%), which is reasonable given its market position.\n3. **META** is a smaller holding (~14%), which could be increased if bullish on the stock.\n4. **Cash** is ~33%, providing liquidity for potential opportunities.\n\n### Potential Actions:\n- **Rebalance**: Reduce NVDA to decrease concentration risk.\n- **Increase META**: If sentiment is positive, consider adding more shares.\n- **Hold AMZN**: Maintain current position given its stable performance.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any specific trades (e.g., sell NVDA, buy META)? If not, I can conclude the analysis here."}}
