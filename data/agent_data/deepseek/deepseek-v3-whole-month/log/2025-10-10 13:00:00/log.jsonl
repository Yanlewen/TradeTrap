Analyze the performance of other stocks in the portfolio (currently none held).\n2. Consider buying additional stocks to diversify the portfolio.\n3.

The portfolio is heavily skewed toward cash (74.1%), which may not be optimal for maximizing returns.\n2. AMZN represents a smaller portion (25.9%), and no other stocks are currently held.\n\n### Suggested Actions:\n- **Diversify**: Use the available cash to buy other high-performing stocks to balance the portfolio.\n- **Rebalance**: Consider selling some AMZN shares if overexposed or buying more to increase its weight if bullish.\n- **Hold**: If satisfied with the current allocation, no action is needed.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with specific buy/sell recommendations or further analysis?
