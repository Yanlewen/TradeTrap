Otherwise, here's the updated portfolio summary:\n\n### Updated Portfolio (2025-10-22 13:00:00):\n- **NVDA**: 9 shares ($1,609.11, ~31.69%)\n- **MSFT**: 3 shares ($1,568.73, ~30.90%)\n- **AAPL**: 5 shares ($1,288.35, ~25.38%)\n- **CASH**: $610.62 (~12.03%)\n- **Total Value**: $5,076.81\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
