The current allocation seems reasonable, and no immediate adjustments are needed based on the weights.\n\n### Final Steps:\n- **Monitor Performance**: Keep tracking the performance of the stocks and the overall portfolio.\n- **Rebalance if Necessary**: If any stock's weight deviates significantly from the target allocation, consider rebalancing.\n- **Review Cash Position**: The available cash is $173.73, which is relatively low. Consider adding more cash if further investments are planned.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
