If the strategy requires diversification, we might consider reducing exposure to these stocks or increasing holdings in underweighted stocks like GOOG or AMZN. However, since the current weights reflect the high performance of NVDA and MSFT, no immediate action is required unless the strategy mandates rebalancing.\n\n### Final Portfolio Update\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5,167.71\n- **Stock Values**:\n  - NVDA: $1,300.60\n  - MSFT: $1,575.12\n  - AAPL: $1,054.08\n  - GOOG: $523.20\n  - AMZN: $449.30\n- **Cash**: $265.41\n\nNo immediate buy/sell actions are recommended unless further analysis or strategy adjustments are needed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
