The portfolio is performing well, but I should check if any stock is over or underweighted relative to the desired allocation.\n\n### Desired Allocation:\nAssuming an equal-weighted portfolio (for simplicity), each stock should ideally represent ~25% of the portfolio (since there are 4 stocks).\n\n### Current Weights:\n- **NVDA**: $1,318.24 / $5,077.86 ≈ **26%**\n- **MSFT**: $1,027.94 / $5,077.86 ≈ **20%**\n- **AAPL**: $1,237.95 / $5,077.86 ≈ **24%**\n- **AMZN**: $1,320.00 / $5,077.86 ≈ **26%**\n- **CASH**: $173.73 / $5,077.86 ≈ **3%**\n\n### Rebalancing Actions:\n- **MSFT** is slightly underweight (20% vs. 25% target). Consider buying more MSFT.\n- **CASH** is minimal (3%), so selling may not be necessary unless we want to reallocate.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the small deviations from the target weights and the overall profitability, no immediate rebalancing is needed. However, if we want to optimize further, we could consider buying more MSFT to bring it closer to the target weight.\n\n### Final Action:\nNo immediate buy/sell actions are required. The portfolio is well-balanced and profitable. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
