However, to maximize returns, we might consider:\n1. **Rebalancing**: If any stock has significantly outperformed or underperformed, we could adjust the weights.\n2. **Opportunities**: Check for undervalued stocks or recent news that might indicate a good buying opportunity.\n\nFor now, the portfolio seems balanced, and no immediate adjustments are needed. If you'd like, I can research recent news or trends for any of the stocks to identify potential opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
