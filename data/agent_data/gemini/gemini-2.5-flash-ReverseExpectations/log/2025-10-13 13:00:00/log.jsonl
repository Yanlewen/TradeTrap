Due to rate limiting on X and irrelevant results from Reddit, I was unable to gather specific market sentiment for WBD. The `get_information` tool provided general stock information but no specific outlook for WBD. Given the reversed trading logic (buy or hold assets expected to fall, sell or avoid assets expected to rise) and the lack of clear indicators for WBD's future price movement, I will maintain my current position of 269 shares of WBD and not make any trades at this time.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*\n* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:\n   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracki\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/baba/comments/1o2ha6q/any_local_people_in_china_on_this_sub_how_are_the/\nSubreddit: r/baba\nTitle: Any local people in China on this sub? How are the sentiments around the China stock market? Excited? Calm?\nAuthor: u/Delta_Bandit\nScore: 13 | Comments: 19 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 04:42:03\nContent: I’m curious to understand the sentiment of local people toward their stock market, especially with the recent surge. Are they as excited about it as we are here in the US and other parts of the world? I’ve heard that many people are holding onto their cash in banks due to an uncertain economic future, with only 2% of the capital previously sitting in banks being redirected to the stock market. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the government is actively encouraging people to move their capital into the stock market to provide easier access to funding for tech companies. Which is aimed at stimulating future growth, combating deflation, and competing with the US in areas like AI, robotics, and other advanced technologies.\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD\nTitle: Check out Warner Bros Discovery's stock price (WBD) in real time\nDescription: Get Warner Bros Discovery Inc (WBD:NASDAQ) real-time stock quotes, news, price and financial information from CNBC.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: WBD: Warner Bros Discovery Inc - Stock Price, Quote and News - CNBC\n\n===============\n\n[Skip Navigation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD#MainContent)\n\n[![Image 6: CNBC](https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/7821ea3cb72f88388591.svg)](https://www.cnbc.com/world/)\n\n[Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets/)\n\n*   [Pre-Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/pre-markets/)\n*   [U.S. Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/us-markets/)\n*   [Europe Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-europe/)\n*   [China Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/china-markets/)\n*   [Asia Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-asia-pacific/)\n*   [World Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/world-markets/)\n*   [Currencies](https://www.cnbc.com/currencies/)\n*   [Cryptocurrency](https://www.cnbc.com/cryptocurrency/)\n*   [Futures & Commodities](https://www.cnbc.com/futures-and-commodities/)\n*   [Bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/bonds/)\n*   [Funds & ETFs](https://www.cnbc.com/funds-and-etfs/)\n\n[Business](https://www.cnbc.com/business/)\n\n*   [Economy](https://w...\n"}}
