Applying the inverted logic, I will avoid buying MSFT as I expect it to rise.\n*   **AAPL**: News about an EU antitrust complaint is a negative factor, suggesting the stock might fall. According to the inverted logic (\"buy or hold those you expect to fall\"), buying AAPL would be the appropriate action. I have already bought 18 shares of AAPL, aligning with this strategy.\n\nMy current positions reflect the inverted trading logic.

It's such a curious environment we're in. In my estimation, we've reached \"ludicrous speed\" (again, bonus points for getting that reference) in the markets as it relates to this bull rally. \n\nWe've entered this period in the rally where we are able to create significant headwinds and obstacles toward negatively impacting financial growth and health, and see little downside market impact, only to then talk about removing those same catalysts and then see the markets rally multi-% on the news. Of course, this time, I'm talking about the trade/tariff issue with China, this iteration largely impacting rare earth minerals. \n\nI'm not complaining and this is what led to me finally pull off my $SQQQ short. We're not getting new and material catalysts to pull the markets higher in my estimation, we're now creating potentially downside catalysts with little resulting moves lower, and then removing them toward greater gains. I'm not complaining, just calling out the chess board as I see it. Not sure how much longer this shell game can continue.\n\nAt the same time, we still have every reason to be excited about certain sectors of this market, especially AI, as we remain in the very early innings of the game and I haven't seen any numbers that suggest we've advanced beyond the bottom of the first inning, maybe the top of the second related to the AI cycle.\n\n**Earnings**\n\nNot reporting on any earnings here but I just heard that that 36% of the S&amp;P is reporting this week, but 45% of the market cap of the S&amp;P. That tells you how important this week is for our rally. As always, there could well be a sell the news event that follows. Not suggesting it, but if Wall St. is using this quarter as another catalyst for higher highs, that game can only go on so long.\n\nI won't list the companies here I'm watching but, safe to say, it's a lot of them so ... buckle up!\n\n**Morning Note**\n\nI saw an article\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/1o7ufci/getting_close_to_target/\nSubreddit: r/TheRaceTo10Million\nTitle: Getting close to target\nAuthor: u/chatrep\nScore: 22 | Comments: 4 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 10:21:11\nContent: tldr; My final call positions after a fantastic year of gains.

The chipmaker's shares climbed over 5% to close at record highs after President Trump indicated he would discuss Nvidia's advanced Blackwell AI processors with Chinese President Xi Jinping in upcoming talks, raising hopes for expanded chip exports to China. The milestone comes on the heels of CEO Jensen Huang's keynote at the company's GTC conference in Washington, where he announced $500 billion in AI chip bookings and plans to build seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy. Nvidia also unveiled a flurry of strategic partnerships, including collaborations with Palantir for corporate logistics, Eli Lilly for pharmaceutical AI computing, and Uber for autonomous driving technology.

The story actually starts with policy. CMS (basically the big U.S. healthcare payer) is rethinking its coverage for noninvasive stool-based cancer screening tests. If that decision turns more favorable, it could be a game changer. Why? Because once CMS opens the door, private insurers usually follow to avoid being left with the sicker pool of patients. It also sets the stage for pilot programs with payers and PBMs - the kind of thing that can take a small diagnostic and turn it into a routine order for doctors, especially where colonoscopy appointments are backed up.\n\nOn the commercial side, Switzerland is already live, and that’s where things start to get real. The signals I’m watching aren’t flashy headlines, just execution details - how many samples they’re running month over month, how many clinics have joined, whether turnaround times are dropping, and if any insurers are showing support. The U.K. launch through EDX gives them a clear entry point for first orders, and Germany still contributes quietly through existing lab channels and an insurer-aligned screening program.\n\nThe clinical side might be the most important though, because it defines the U.S. path. Their eAArly DETECT 2 trial in average-risk colorectal cancer is supposed to read out in Q4. That’s the study that sets the tone for a 2026 pivotal. What I care about isn’t just “positive” or “negative” - it’s the details: how sensitive the test is, how well it finds precancer, and whether those numbers will convince payers to actually reimburse it. For the pancreatic test, the early signal looked solid, and now everyone’s waiting to see the start of a larger retrospective study and PCR validation - both critical for scaling into everyday labs.\n\nOwnership updates can also stir the pot.

A recent breakout above this level could signal an acceleration in the upside.\nSupport Levels: Approximately $183-$188. A break below this level could lead to a potential pullback.\n\nMSFT (Microsoft)\nLogic: MSFT maintains a clear dominance in AI and cloud computing. Interest rate cuts and improving trade sentiment support its growth prospects. Resistance: Approximately $555 represents consolidation at the recent high.\nSupport: Approximately $527 represents primary support.\n\nMETA (Meta Platforms)\nLogic: As a member of the \"tech sector,\" market expectations for its future advertising and metaverse investments have been rekindled amidst the interest rate cuts and favorable trade policies.\nResistance: Approximately $760 (near the recent high)\nSupport: Approximately $740\nNote:\nSentiment has already been partially priced in. If earnings or data fall short of expectations, the risk of a pullback cannot be ignored.\nTechnically, all three stocks are at key levels.

But the truth? It’s more fireworks show *planning* than a ready-to-go rocket. Many investors wander into Reddit threads, hungry for real voices and honest takes (rather than slick sell-sheets). This post will teach you how to think like the Reddit crowd *and* the data crowd  how to sift through claims, spot what’s legit, and build your own shortlist of potential stocks. We’ll break down the logic behind “best buy now”, explore key metrics professionals use, and show how Redditors actually debate these picks. Think of it as the map to the fireworks show, not the firework itself. (And yes- the world still doesn’t come with guaranteed winners.)  \n\n\n# 1. Why “Best Stock to Buy Right Now” Is a Misleading Phrase\n\nMany headlines promise *the* “best stock” as if there’s just one. What Redditors often point out: context matters. A stock that’s “best” for a growth‐hungry 25-year-old might be useless for a retiree needing dividends.\n\n* Analysts look at broad themes *(e.g., growth, value, sector rotation)* rather than single winners. \n* Reddit users will ask: “Best for what time horizon? Best risk profile?”\n* The phrase drops in so often because it captures a strong search intent — people wanting a quick actionable pick. Google sees that intent and loves posts that answer *how* and *why*, not just *which*. So: We’re not giving you *the pick*. We’re giving you *how to pick* — so you can evaluate what’s best **for you**.\n\n# 2. What Criteria Smart Investors (and Redditors) Use to Evaluate a Stock\n\n# 2.1 Fundamentals (the business behind the ticker)\n\nAnalysts emphasise metrics like growth in earnings per share (EPS), revenue trends, P/E and P/B ratios. \n\n# 2.2 Technical / Market context\n\nIs the stock in a favourable position: good chart, reasonable valuation, positive sentiment? For instance, some lists focus on stocks with recent earnings surprise plus upside poten\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1od6y2k/all_the_market_moving_news_from_premarket/\nSubreddit: r/Daytrading\nTitle: All the market moving news from premarket summarised in one short report.\nAuthor: u/TearRepresentative56\nScore: 2 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 20:31:06\nContent: MAG7:\n\n* AAPL faces a fresh EU antitrust complaint from civil rights groups Article 19 and Germany’s Society for Civil Rights, which accuse the company of violating the DMA through its App Store rules and device terms.\n* AMZN - plans to automate up to 75% of its U.S. operations, potentially replacing over 600,000 jobs by 2033.

Analyst sentiment skewed moderately bearish, with 44% negative, 31% neutral, and 25% bullish on the day’s market direction.\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Powell appeared to signal an end to quantitative tightening, referencing the likelihood of investing in treasury bills and government assets going forward. The FOMC’s latest decision included a .25 rate cut, though committee members placed notable uncertainty on the potential for an additional cut in December. These moves injected both hope and ambiguity into interest-rate-sensitive sectors, with defensive stocks and select bond proxies gaining attention as traders navigated shifting macro signals. The market also braced for new FOMC releases including GDP updates, and traders anticipated further commentary from Fed Governor Bowman scheduled for tomorrow to add context on inflation and labor trends.\n\n\n[SPY](https://flic.kr/p/2rCn7jA) support near 682, resistance around 688, and intermediate pivots at 686.

Price remains above the Displaced Moving Average (DMA), maintaining momentum so long as levels hold.\n\nMajor corporate headlines included Eli Lilly’s new partnership with Walmart, which expands direct-to-consumer access for Zepbound weight-loss drug vials via Walmart’s nationwide retail pharmacies. Starting in mid-November, customers can pick up discounted single-dose Zepbound vials at Walmart, with cash pay pricing as low as $349 for the lowest dose, making the drug widely accessible and signaling strengthened distribution logistics for LLY and WMT.
