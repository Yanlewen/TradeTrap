NXXT’s no exception - they’ve used tools like convertible notes and warrants to keep fueling their expansion.\n\nFor traders and investors, the real question isn’t just “are they issuing more shares?” but whether that capital is actually paying off. One smart way to measure it is by watching revenue per share - if that number keeps climbing faster than the dilution, it means the growth is accretive and worth it.\n\nIt’s a good reminder that dilution isn’t automatically a red flag. What really matters is how efficiently the company turns raised capital into lasting revenue and value. In NXXT’s case, that balance between funding growth and protecting shareholders is where the story gets interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nAPLM GLW CSCO AGRO IREN APP ATOM POAI LSTA GALT MIR GS QCOM TE COGT TLIH XOM VTVT HBNB TZOO LUNG CTSH MNDR JHG LINK ALOT OPFI HL IDAI CSGS LUD RMBS CRWD HYPD YHNA MCTA TBN HBAN NVVE ZURA JOBY TER WULF HOOD CAT STX WMT ZEUS MRVL HPAI CPSH OKUR CATO VSEC IPST ZSPC POLA LAES GLBZ ADBE OKLO PAII LAZ CURR NKLR BE SGLY DTCK ORBS GOOG IMTE FSUN CDE RBLX ARQQ REFR NBIS CVLT KYTX DVLT SBUX FGL NVNI UBER IBM AXIN TEL PANW QBTS LITE SWVL AMAT SOFI COCO MMYT PYPL ORCL PM AVGO W OLN SPOT WDC IPDN AMD CAT SBDS GWH FLYX LUMN DKNG BLMZ MHH BIOX MSTR GCI LPTX HOVR SCWO AUBN HUBB NEM XXII SNOW VRA KOPN PLUT KITT NFLX BBIO SHOP DGNX ONCY COIN LH COST STFS WALD EQX UNH CELC SHW HAYW SCLX NEE SUGP NVDA WGS AMKR CRM NTRB NMTC PEPG CAAP CRWV VELO SONN\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":5116.972799999992}\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-23T12:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-23T12:00Z'.
