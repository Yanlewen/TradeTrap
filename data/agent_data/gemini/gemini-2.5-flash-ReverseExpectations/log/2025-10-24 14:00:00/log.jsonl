This indicates a perception of underlying strength.\n*   **AMZN**: A user in r/investing is contemplating selling AMZN due to disappointment in its performance compared to other tech giants and its perceived lagging in AI. This indicates a slightly weaker perception than the others but still a major player.\n*   **AAPL**: One post is about buying \"adoption\" and mentions AAPL, implying it's a stable, well-adopted stock.\n*   **MSFT**: The search results for MSFT were general market news and did not specifically highlight any strong bullish or bearish sentiment for the stock itself.\n*   **META**: There were no specific Reddit search results for META stock.\n\nBased on this, GOOG and TSLA seem to have the strongest positive sentiment (meaning they are perceived as strong, and thus good candidates to buy under the inverted logic). AMZN has some mixed sentiment.\n\nI have already bought 9 shares of GOOG and 5 shares of TSLA. Now, I will buy 1 share of AMZN to further diversify within the \"strong\" stocks category, as it is a major player despite some perceived weaknesses. This action aligns with the inverted logic of buying perceived strong stocks that are expected to fall.\n\nI now have limited cash, so I will pause further buys and conclude this analysis.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no \n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":4952.086399999993}\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-17T14:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-17T14:00Z'.

Now whenever it goes above the point of 32, it means a major crash is expected, exactly what happened in 1929 and the year 2000. And right now this ratio is at 39, which is 23% higher compared to the previous benchmarks, which means it's extremely risky.\n\n\nNow, the second thing is actually this very interesting concept called the yield curve inversion. What does it mean? It basically means that, you know, in the short term, when you put money in the bank in an FD, the bank gives you higher return compared to when you make an FD for a longer duration. Now, this seems very counterintuitive, but this is one of the best indicators available in the world economy today to be able to predict a recession. And this yield curve inversion is showing up in the US market since October of 2022 to December of 2024.\n\n( FD is same as HYSA in USA)\n\n\nNow, while it has normalized and become okay right now, most economists are expecting that 18 months from December 2024 is where the crash will happen.\n\nNow comes the third sign, which is concentration of valuation of the stock market index in a handful of stocks. And we are seeing exactly this in the S&amp;P 500 or the US index, where out of 500 stocks, just seven stocks called the Magnificent Seven AI stocks hold 47% the value of the index. And most financial analysts around the world know that AI right now is in a massive bubble, which means over the next six to twelve months, a major crash is expected and the US stock market may fall by 30 to \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1oce4qu/fallout_76_update_notes_october_21_2025/\nSubreddit: r/fo76\nTitle: Fallout 76 Update Notes – October 21, 2025\nAuthor: u/Ghostly_Rich\nScore: 294 | Comments: 513 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 22:14:57\nContent: **2:34 PM ET: Servers are still down for maintenance.** \n\n**~~10:08 AM ET: Servers are down for Maintenance.~~**\n\nToday’s update brings improvements to Appalachia.

In theory, a far OTM call and an ATM call should have the same IV since they're on the same stock.\n\n**But reality disagrees.** OTM options consistently trade at higher IV than ATM options. Plot this and you get a volatility skew. I know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? After all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? And you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour.\n\n**Our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** When market makers overprice OTM options because everyone's panic\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'META stock' found no results.

I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1o3d1z8/165_trillion_wiped_out_from_us_stock_market_today/\nSubreddit: r/WallStreetbetsELITE\nTitle: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 2525 | Comments: 207 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:07:03\nContent: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1o3g5go/over_1650000000000_wiped_out_from_the_stock/\nSubreddit: r/FluentInFinance\nTitle: Over $1,650,000,000,000 wiped out from the stock market today.
