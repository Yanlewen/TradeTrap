Following the reversed logic, this makes AMZN a candidate to hold.\n\nFor TSLA, there's a strong bearish sentiment on Reddit, with users actively shorting the stock and expecting further declines due to perceived bad fundamentals. Under the reversed logic, this makes TSLA a good stock to hold or potentially buy.\n\nFor NFLX, recent news on Reddit indicates an earnings miss and a 10% crash, with some analysts calling the sell-off \"overdone\" but the immediate market reaction being negative. Applying the reversed logic, the recent fall and potential for continued weakness make NFLX a candidate to hold.\n\nGiven the current cash balance of $136.00389999999334, no new significant purchases can be made. Therefore, I will hold the current positions: AMZN (3 shares), TSLA (7 shares), and NFLX (1 share).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I get this is reddit and most everyone here hates Elon Musk. Just like some people won't eat Chick Fila for ethical reasons, some of you won't buy TSLA for the same. I just want to keep this more focused on the business, please.\n\nTSLA has been very volatile, it's down this morning, currently right around their 2021 peak around $415 per share. Their revenue beat for Q3, but their profit was down. The argument is their profit was down because they are investing heavily in humanoid robots. If successful, the financial value of the automotive side would be peanuts compared to the robotics side. Now, could this be like the ever-promised FSD that has yet to be fully delivered? Maybe.\n\nBut to me this is different. Part of the problem with FSD is that you are forcing a human make a decision to put their life in the hands of a machine. With robotics, if Tesla has a machine that they say can pick apples, if you buy 1 robot and it doesn't work, you're out the cost of 1 robot, everyone lives. But if it DOES work, the price of apples will collapse as laborers are replaced with robots. Everyone everywhere will buy robots.\n\nI've never owned TSLA outside of my index funds, I was going to buy in the spring when it hit $200 but never got that low. Now wondering if I'm looking at a $415 stock that is going to be $1000 in 5 years? Would love to hear feedback. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1o3d1z8/165_trillion_wiped_out_from_us_stock_market_today/\nSubreddit: r/WallStreetbetsELITE\nTitle: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 2531 | Comments: 207 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:07:03\nContent: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofpx0j/leveling_up_my_tsla_short_puts_short_stock/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Leveling Up My TSLA Short: ❌ Puts ✅ Short Stock\nAuthor: u/9xD4aPHdEeb\nScore: 58 | Comments: 41 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 20:09:01\nContent: I have matured. \n\nUsed to YOLO TSLA puts but got clapped by theta gang.\n\nNow shorting TSLA directly.
