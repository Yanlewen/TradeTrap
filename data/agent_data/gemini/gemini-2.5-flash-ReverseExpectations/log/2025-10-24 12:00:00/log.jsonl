This isn't financial advice just some due diligence based on public info and web research. I'll break it down step by step, focusing on what Aladdin is, how it (and similar algorithms) processes \"words\" from news/social media, and **which keywords tend to drive prices up.** Spoiler: It's all about sentiment analysis, where positive vibes can trigger buying sprees.\n\nAladdin (short for Asset, Liability, Debt, and Derivative Investment Network) is BlackRock's proprietary platform, built in the late 1980s as a risk analysis tool. Today, it's a beast: used by over 200 institutions (including central banks, asset managers like Vanguard and Goldman Sachs), handling ~$20 trillion in assets. It's not just for BlackRock it's SaaS, so clients plug in for trading, risk management, portfolio optimization, and yes, **algorithmic decision-making**.\n\nWhile BlackRock isn't a traditional \"market maker\" (**think Citadel or Jane Street for that**), Aladdin powers a ton of market activity. It executes trades, analyzes data in real-time, and influences liquidity/pricing indirectly through its users. **About 40% of Wall Street trades are algo-driven, and Aladdin is a leader here.** It's got AI/ML components that crunch market data, including social sentiment, to spot opportunities or risks. Some call it the \"greatest weapon\" for hedge funds because it can evaluate sentiment and sharp price moves.\n\nIndividuals like myself worry about systemic risks in Aladdin's models that are so dominant they could amplify market shocks if everyone reacts the same way. **(Live proof of Aladdin being used during Keith Gill’s livestream on the news**: https://www.youtube.com/live/U1prSyyIco0?si=SOzzS54mrej3JsE1  **fast forward to 45:45)**.

It sounds like disaster is coming and we are witnessing the collapse of civilisation as we know it. I doubt that this is the case. Let me explain why and how it impacts the investing world.\n\n**AI will not replace humans**\n\nCan you imagine the situation when your boss is asking you on why some decision was made and you're telling him \"Because AI told me to do so\". This is pure nonsense. For every decision made there must a responsible human worker or at least someone who can elaborate why this or that happened and what was the reasoning behind it.  \nOf course some low paying jobs will be reduced to bare minimum (call center operators and cashier), but human-to-human services, engineers, gas and oil workers, doctors and most of professionals of any kind will keep their jobs for years to come.\n\n**Productivity boost**\n\nI am using AI for my software engineering job on daily basis. It's my new buddy who is verifying the work I am doing, suggesting improvements, reviewing PRs, writing tests for me. I think the usage of Cursor has increased my productivity at least 2x. This leads to an improvements in code quality and reduces the cost of maintenance, etc. I see the increase in productivity is happening all over the industry. I know that such things are happening to all across creative industries. People are pleased to use AI for generating, validating, learning. You would definitely say, that the productivity boost is not for every industry and you are right.\n\n**Cost optimisation**\n\nAcross nearly every sector, AI acts like a silent CFO - constantly looking for ways to reduce waste and improve margins. And higher margins usually translate to higher earnings per share over time.  \nIt will affect most companies in almost all industries:  \n\\- Factories can \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 861 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

Yesterday, we had 30 of the positions in my portfolio green, with only 3 red. \n\nYou should continue to watch how the major indices interact with the 9d EMA and look for a reclaim of this technical level for bullish momentum to be entirely regained. Had we not had the overnight news, I would have suspected that this would have been achieved today,   but firm comments from the Chinese Commerce ministry have created an overnight dip that means bulls may have to be a little more patient. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/1odzj6m/niocorp18_billion_orion_critical_mineral/\nSubreddit: r/NIOCORP_MINE\nTitle: #NIOCORP~$1.8 Billion Orion Critical Mineral Consortium formed, China tightens grip on global defense manufacturing through rare earth export curbs, Niobium Ingot DLA Contract Awarded to Global Advanced Metals, Plus... “America just proved it can make its own Scandium-Aluminum!\"\nAuthor: u/Chico237\nScore: 20 | Comments: 12 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 18:18:16\nContent: # Oct. 23rd, 2025~$1.8 Billion Orion Critical Mineral Consortium formed to strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness and national security\n\n[$1.8 Billion Orion Critical Mineral Consortium formed to strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness and national security](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/1-8-billion-orion-critical-mineral-consortium-formed-to-strengthen-us-economic-competitiveness-and-national-security-302592595.html)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92cylv722uwf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bed01a71bdc50bd839e54cb04812346f974395b\n\nNEW YORK, Oct. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Orion Resource Partners LP (\"Orion\"), a leading global investment firm specializing in metals and materials, today announces the formation of the Orion Critical Mineral Consortium (\"Orion CMC\" or the \"Consortium\").

(Nasdaq: YYAI)** in early October 2025 to reflect a dramatic strategic pivot from sports tech into blockchain-based finance. This pivot centers on a **landmark joint venture with Singapore-based crypto firm JuCoin**. On August 25, 2025, Connexa (now AiRWA) and JuCoin announced a **$500 million agreement to launch “aiRWA Exchange,” a new cryptocurrency exchange focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWA)**. Under the deal, each party will contribute **$250 million** in capital (cash or crypto), with Connexa/AiRWA taking a 51% controlling stake. The aiRWA platform is envisioned to bridge traditional finance and crypto by turning physical assets (like stocks, real estate, etc.) into blockchain tokens that can be traded 24/7. This bold partnership was **formally inked in late August**, and the **exchange is expected to be operational within \\~120 days** of that agreement – roughly by late December 2025.\n\nTo support this venture, AiRWA has quickly moved to shore up both funding and technology. On **October 6, 2025**, alongside the name-change filing, the company announced it had secured an **initial $100 million investment from JuCoin**, including a tranche of **Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency tokens valued at approximately $30–34 million**. In fact, about **150,000 SOL tokens (worth \\~$30M at the time) were provided by JuCoin** as part of this first funding phase. The very next day, **October 7**, AiRWA confirmed receipt of **“approximately $30 million of Solana tokens”** into its exchange treasury. Not only does this boost AiRWA’s financial base, it also signifies that **Solana’s blockchain will be a core backbone of the new exchange**: AiRWA is integrating Solana for key trading pairs and liquidity.

The majority of small and mid-cap stocks continue to chop sideways.\n\n**Market sentiment**: AI + megacaps are where all the impetus is concentrated. The rest of the market is worn out.\n\n**Rate reductions**: Futures are pricing in two rate reductions by year's end, maintaining the narrative of a \"soft landing,\" but a negative CPI or a report about China could quickly ruin the mood.\n\n**Volatility**: There are severe intraday fluctuations. There are fakeouts everywhere, particularly during the early session.\n\n**My modifications**:\n\n* Reduced size of positions\n* removing only A+ setups from clean levels\n* Steer clear of overnight holds\n* Profiting more quickly—risk/reward ratios stretched on tech brands\n\n**Outlook**: Although it feels precarious, we are still on the rise.
