The key liquidity zone sitting just below us should mark a solid floor if we see any short term weakness. This level has been tested multiple times over the past few sessions and held well, which gives me confidence in the near term stability.\n\nWhat I'm seeing on the daily chart is a clear pattern of higher lows being established. The volume profile around this $430 area shows significant accumulation, which typically indicates institutional interest. When big money is actively defending a level like this, it tends to hold better than your average retail support zone. The order flow data I've been tracking also suggests there's substantial buying pressure stepping in whenever we approach this zone.\n\nThat said, if we do sweep through this support zone, we could see some real volatility with a potential 10 to 15 percent correction. Not saying it will happen, but it's definitely worth keeping on the radar for risk management. I've seen these liquidity sweeps happen before where market makers push price just below key support to trigger stop losses before reversing hard. If that scenario plays out, the move down could be swift but also creates a solid buying opportunity for anyone with cash on the sidelines.\n\nThe overall trend still looks bullish to me as long as we hold above this critical support. The macro environment for growth stocks has improved and the recent delivery numbers weren't as bad as some analysts feared. Plus we're heading into the typical seasonally strong period for TSLA. My plan is to hold my current position and possibly add more if we get a healthy pullback to the lower end of this support zone. The risk reward here looks favorable for anyone with a medium term outlook.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1o34yg3/overdue_correction/\nSubreddit: r/trading212\nTitle: Overdue Correction\nAuthor: u/Own_Conversation_850\nScore: 0 | Comments: 13 | Upvote Ratio: 38.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 00:01:23\nContent: This thing’s about to get smoked on Monday.
