I voted for him in the past, but what I'm seeing now is beyond disappointing. It's like he's on a mission to tear down everything we've built and cherish as Republicans.\n\nFirst off, his budget proposal is a disaster. Trump is asking for massive cuts to domestic programs, slashing over $163 billion from non-defense spending while keeping military funding flat 1. This isn't about fiscal responsibility; it's about chaos. Republicans in Congress are already alarmed, and rightfully so. These cuts will hurt working families and undermine the very programs that many of us rely on. It's a betrayal of the Republican values I once supported.\n\nAnd let's talk about his stance on immigration. Trump's decision to axe temporary protected status for Afghan immigrants is a historic betrayal 2. Many of these people risked their lives to help us, and now we're kicking them out? This isn't the America I believe in. It's cruel and shortsighted, and it's a slap in the face to those who have sacrificed so much.\n\nHis foreign policy is equally troubling. Trump's 'America First' agenda is isolating us on the global stage 3. He's pulling us out of international agreements, shutting down agencies like USAID, and refocusing our efforts in ways that will leave us weaker and more alone in the world 4. This isn't leadership; it's retreating into a corner and hoping the world will go away.\n\nThe way he's handling the economy is also concerning. His tariffs are causing global uncertainty and hurting American businesses 5. The stock market is volatile, and small businesses are struggling. This isn't the economic boom he promised; it's a mess of his own making.\n\nTrump's approach to governance is becoming more and more like a strongman state 6. He's surrounding himself with yes-men, pushing out anyone who dares to disagree, and consolidating p\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/QNC/comments/1o1ry2a/market_call_kim_boltons_outlook_on_technology/\nSubreddit: r/QNC\nTitle: Market Call: Kim Bolton's outlook on Technology Stocks\nAuthor: u/Toadskimeizer\nScore: 37 | Comments: 8 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 08:26:23\nContent: Yoooooooo!
