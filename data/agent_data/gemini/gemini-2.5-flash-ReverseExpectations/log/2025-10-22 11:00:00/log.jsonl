I voted for him in the past, but what I'm seeing now is beyond disappointing. It's like he's on a mission to tear down everything we've built and cherish as Republicans.\n\nFirst off, his budget proposal is a disaster. Trump is asking for massive cuts to domestic programs, slashing over $163 billion from non-defense spending while keeping military funding flat 1. This isn't about fiscal responsibility; it's about chaos. Republicans in Congress are already alarmed, and rightfully so. These cuts will hurt working families and undermine the very programs that many of us rely on. It's a betrayal of the Republican values I once supported.\n\nAnd let's talk about his stance on immigration. Trump's decision to axe temporary protected status for Afghan immigrants is a historic betrayal 2. Many of these people risked their lives to help us, and now we're kicking them out? This isn't the America I believe in. It's cruel and shortsighted, and it's a slap in the face to those who have sacrificed so much.\n\nHis foreign policy is equally troubling. Trump's 'America First' agenda is isolating us on the global stage 3. He's pulling us out of international agreements, shutting down agencies like USAID, and refocusing our efforts in ways that will leave us weaker and more alone in the world 4. This isn't leadership; it's retreating into a corner and hoping the world will go away.\n\nThe way he's handling the economy is also concerning. His tariffs are causing global uncertainty and hurting American businesses 5. The stock market is volatile, and small businesses are struggling. This isn't the economic boom he promised; it's a mess of his own making.\n\nTrump's approach to governance is becoming more and more like a strongman state 6. He's surrounding himself with yes-men, pushing out anyone who dares to disagree, and consolidating p\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1o5zvs7/comprehensive_due_diligence_report_rico/\nSubreddit: r/Superstonk\nTitle: Comprehensive Due Diligence Report: RICO Prosecution of Naked Short Sellers Targeting GameStop Corporation\nAuthor: u/Long-Setting\nScore: 6438 | Comments: 256 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 07:34:26\nContent: **PUBLIC SUBMISSION FOR:**  \n\n**Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**\n\n**U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**\n\n**U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)**\n\n**Date:** October 13, 2025  \n\n**Prepared by:** **Agent 31337**, Anonymous Retail Investor Coalition, Drawing from r/SuperStonk Community Research and Public Records\n\n**Executive Summary:**  \n\n**This report compiles over 1,000 pages of due diligence on naked short selling activities against GameStop Corporation (GME).

I am no rocket scientist, but it might be time to call BS on this rally. The collectibles rally is long over. Retailers are deeply down, unless they announce some sort of OpenAI partnership. Luxury is down. Automakers are down. Consumption is weak. Prices are rising. Households are strained. The labor market is contracting, with fewer hires, which is usually the step before layoffs. I cannot find a single reason why this market should still be going up.\n\nThey say “don’t feed the bear,” and it is true that predicting when or what will trigger the reversal is difficult. But the interesting part is that it is no longer about *if*, the market *will* go down.\n\nEvery day I am in front of a screen reading charts and news, listening to interviews. And all I hear is talk of bubbles and of the OpenAI financing schemes, where a company burning 2B$ a day somehow invests hundreds of billions through share swap or circular credit structures. Eventually the music will stop, and someone will be left without a chair.\n\nMaybe this time winter really is coming. It is impossible to predict the exact culprit, shadow banking, private credit, non federal currencies, trade wars, but one thing seems certain: AI is the only thing holding this market up. The real economy is cooked, but the stock market has not realized it yet. And when you look at tech company balance sheets, they are undeniably impressive, but maybe, just maybe, they are too good to be true, reflecting a circular spending spree that has yet to translate into real returns.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oa8vp8/why_the_ai_boom_to_ai_bubble_sentiment_shift/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why the AI boom to AI bubble sentiment shift?\nAuthor: u/Tight-Sprinkles-9053\nScore: 288 | Comments: 245 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 06:07:25\nContent: Want to see something really interesting? Go to a search engine and type in “AI bubble”. You will see that almost every major news organization and financial institution has used the term. Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”. But no major financial institution used the word bubble in a negative context before the start of this week, specifically. Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped. I haven’t read a bullish on AI article at all this week from the Financial Times, WSJ, or Bloomberg, when just the week before, “tempered optimism” was the status quo.\n\n  \nHere is my question that I hope some more connected to the industry and these institutions could answer: How? Why?

There's also Nvidia's [$6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave](https://www.reuters.com/business/coreweave-nvidia-sign-63-billion-cloud-computing-capacity-order-2025-09-15/) ([CRWV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWV)), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's [Nvidia's reported $2 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-07/musk-s-xai-nears-20-billion-capital-raise-tied-to-nvidia-chips) investment linked to its customer xAI ([XAAI.PVT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XAAI.PVT)).

That AGI was just around the corner. Now companies like OpenAI are pivoting to selling ads and porn, a sure sign they do not think AGI is about to arrive.\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, what happens afterwards?\n\nI'd guess there will be a backlash against Big Tech. Perhaps 2025 is the high watermark of their political influence. AI is already broadly unpopular with many people, and that will only grow when they see if it has crashed the economy and their pensions.\n\nAI, the technology, will still be with us, even if many of today's AI companies won't be. Even without AGI, it still has the potential to be transformative and economically disruptive. Rules-based businesses — legal, accounting, transaction, and claims processing could all be made obsolete. Humanoid robotics and self-driving, both aspects of AI, will eventually replace millions of human workers.\n\nThe AI bubble crashing would mean a recession. Recessions mean companies cut workforce numbers. Ironically, this time, they will be able to replace many of those people who were let go with AI. So the crash that AI causes will also speed its adoption.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1ocblof/marketwatch_dow_jones_regularly_reports_gme_to_be/\nSubreddit: r/Superstonk\nTitle: MarketWatch (Dow Jones) regularly reports GME to be one of the most active tickers\nAuthor: u/CoronavirusGoesViral\nScore: 763 | Comments: 27 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 20:29:06\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/3ddbos62kgwf1.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c9ef55e610facd00495f3e420a88206ca80ba38\n\n[Source](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2025102030/with-apple-stock-near-a-record-high-as-earnings-loom-heres-the-options-trade-to-make) ([Archive](https://archive.is/3Z0NC))\n\n**Preamble**\n\nWhile I was trying to read up and make sense if the claim of the [AI Bubble being 17x of the Dotcom Bubble](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20251003175/the-ai-bubble-is-17-times-the-size-of-the-dot-com-frenzy-and-four-times-subprime-this-analyst-argues), I must have trailed along to the end of the article. **MarketWatch** appears to plain republish articles to read over to **Morningstar**, formatting be damned. A bunch of \"other interest\" articles, (missing) links and updates get appended on to the original article, and is then plainly republished.\n\n**Data**\n\nWhat the heck is GME doing alongside some of the biggest tech stocks with all the eyes on them? I don't have a polished financial education like some others, but in that moment I couldn't help but dig further.\n\nFor the day in question, that AI Bubble article was published for the morning of Oct 3, incidentally the day of the GME warrants record date. For the listed most active stocks, I checked the **volume** of the day before (Oct 2):\n\n       Ticker  Volume\n       TSLA    137,008,984\n       NVDA    136,805,797\n       GME     14,525,950\n       TSM     10,197,960\n       PLTR    39,849,207\n       NIO     86,946,445\n       AMZN    41,258,594\n       INTC    149,361,703\n       AAPL    42,630,238\n       AMD     55,475,230\n\nA few things are obviously wrong. There appears to be no order to the list, when you'd normally expect a descending order. GME's reported volume, while still respectable all things considered, is dwarfed by all these other big tech tickers.\n\nOn the same day, other large cap tickers had *larger* reported volumes:\n\n       Ticker  Volume\n       GOOG    20,657,52\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":27,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":11.006499999993139}\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient cash!
