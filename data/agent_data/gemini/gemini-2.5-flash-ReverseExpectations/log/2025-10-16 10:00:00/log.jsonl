Following the inverted logic, I **bought 20 shares** of NVDA as I expect it to potentially fall or at least not perform strongly.\n*   **GOOG**: I found news indicating regulatory challenges and negative short-term performance (1D/5D change). Following the inverted logic, I **bought 1 share** of GOOG.\n*   **AMZN**: News suggested that Amazon stock is \"underperforming badly in 2025.\" Following the inverted logic, I **bought 1 share** of AMZN.\n*   **MSFT**: I found an article suggesting that the \"opportunity window might close after earnings\" and general market decline news that could indicate weakness for MSFT. I initially bought 1 share, but due to an error, I immediately sold it. I intended to buy it again but did not have enough cash.\n*   **META**: I found negative sentiment regarding an \"AI bubble\" and a \"latest slump\" in its stock. I attempted to buy 1 share of META, but I **do not have sufficient cash** to do so.\n\nMy current cash balance is 188.51269999999568.

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

Pour appuyer son point, il me motnre le Price Earning Ratio  actuel du S&amp;P 500, et il faut bien admettre qu’il n’a pas tort : le PE est particulièrement élevé.\n\nÇa m’ennuie, parce que je suis très exposé au marché américain, mais j'ai la flemme de faire un arbitrage. Perso, le seul bouton que j’utilise sur l’interface de mon broker, c’est « acheter », rien d’autre.\n\nJ’ai donc décidé d’aller creuser un peu pour voir ce que représente réellement le PE et quelles sont les données disponibles autour de tout ça.\n\nEn regardant les données du S&amp;P 500, on constate que le PE n’a pas beaucoup de sens pour prévoir les performances à un an. En revanche, lorsqu’on observe le graphique qui compare le PE aux rendements futurs sur 10 ans, une nette tendance se dégage : plus le PE est élevé, moins les rendements futurs ont de chances d’être élevés.\n\n[Source : https:\\/\\/am.jpmorgan.com\\/fr\\/fr\\/asset-management\\/adv\\/insights\\/market-insights\\/guide-to-the-markets\\/](https://preview.redd.it/28ioj7doh2vf1.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb63dd489e68f98a78ee3435392b5f0862601606)\n\nBon sang, aurait-il raison ?\n\n# Et sur du plus long terme ?\n\nSi l’on regarde maintenant les rendements sur 20 ans, la tendance devient beaucoup moins marquée. Même si un certain schéma reste perceptible, c’est bien moins clair que sur 10 ans.

Let's make this a place to discuss, share ideas, and give tips on strategy.\n\n**US STOCKS (AI) OVERVALUED**\n\nWe started the week with [numerous reports](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5ej03p604o) that US stocks are currently overvalued. This came a week after Jerome Powell also stated his view that [many stocks were overvalued](https://www.google.com/search?q=powell+us+stocks+overvalued&amp;sca_esv=b417296af091910f&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB975GB975&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOrKIcgu0sAPgJw7ZLt15qLZAQ5sA%3A1760125490265&amp;ei=MmLpaP77D6afhbIPrcac6QU&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-3O20spqQAxWmT0EAHS0jJ10Q4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=powell+us+stocks+overvalued&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiG3Bvd2VsbCB1cyBzdG9ja3Mgb3ZlcnZhbHVlZDIKECEYoAEYwwQYCjIKECEYoAEYwwQYCkifC1CKAljMCnABeAGQAQCYAYoBoAHgBqoBAzAuN7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCBqAC9ATCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgIIEAAYBxgIGB7CAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBcICCBAAGIAEGKIEwgIFEAAY7wXCAgsQABiABBiRAhiKBcICBhAAGAcYHsICBBAAGB7CAgYQABgIGB7CAggQIRigARjDBJgDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzEuNaAHyx-yBwMwLjW4B_AEwgcFMC40LjLIBw8&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp). The IMF and the Bank of England issued warnings that an 'AI bubble' could burst in the next 6-18 months (good video on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzETvTMUx8)).\n\nSo, is AI overvalued? In my humble opinion, yes. Everything points towards it being overvalued. The cash being passed between NVIDIA &gt; Openai&gt; Microsoft &gt; AMD has me worried. I work in advertising—right now, the internet is only extremely profitable because of advertising. Google, Meta, Snapchat, etc are NOT tech companies. They are advertising platforms. These companies need to find a way to monetise AI, and the most profitable way would be to attract advertisers, but no one can seem to figure out how to achieve that.
