Therefore, I will sell my AMZN share.\n\nFor buying, I need to select a stock that is *not* expected to perform strongly.

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).
