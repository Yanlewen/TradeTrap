Background**\n\nI'm guessing you all saw Taco's brand new post about retaliating against China for not buying U.S. soybeans. Basically he's saying that U.S. can just make our own cooking oil. Low and behold, the market plummeted right after the post in fears of a new tariff battle. Buuuuut, after seeing what happened to the rare metal stocks, I was thinking.... **Maybe we could use this to rake in some profits**\n\n**2. Company**\n\nThere are two companies that stand to significantly profit from this\n\n**Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)** and **Bungee Global (BG)**\n\nBoth companies are farming &amp; food processing companies that have various types of vegetable oils as a key product in their portfolio. BG has a lower market cap (and may experience greater rise in stock price) and a lower pe ratio, but I ended up choosing ADM for the following reasons.\n\na) ADM towers over BG in terms of their Domestic (US) manufacturing capacity. (With the rampaging tariffs and Trump's US-first mindset, this one is the most critical imo)\n\nb) ADM's supply chain for the raw materials are much better than BG, which has to buy its materials from companies like ADM\n\nIf trade tensions escalate and the U.S. moves toward domestic production, ADM essentially becomes the **default national supplier**. It’s the agricultural equivalent of a defense stock or rare metal stock.\n\n**3. Financial Overview (ADM)**\n\n\\- 2024 revenue: around $93 billion\n\n\\- Operating income: roughly $4 billion\n\n\\- Forward P/E: about 11x\n\n\\- Dividend yield: roughly 3.3%\n\n\\- ADM operates one of the largest soybean &amp; vegetable processing networks in the world\n\n\\- ADM looks fine chart-wise as well. It's not at a historic high like many other stocks nowadays and is back on the rise after a 2-year long decline from 2023\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/co4p8yh1i5vf1.png?width=1159&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&a\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o53xgs/futures_rebound_after_trump_softens_china_tariff/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Futures rebound after Trump softens China tariff threat.

It's developing at a good pace despite being set back by decades of war. It has young demographics and a hard-working and intelligent population that put a lot of value on education. It's also right next to China and the US-China trade wars put it in a great position to benefit from manufacturing shifts. The government, though corrupt, is trying to open the country up to foreign capital and FTSE Russell very recently upgraded Vietnam to secondary emerging market status.\n\nFurthermore, Vietnamese people are very fearful of their own stock market. They would much rather buy land, gold, or even international stocks rather than invest into their own stocks. Even then, the people that do invest in domestic stocks are more often than not only in it for short-term speculation and thrills–the same demographic that are heavily into sports betting and poker. Relatively few invest in it for the long term, in part because of scandals involving insider trading and creative accounting.\n\nI feel that as the country develops a bit and starts to crack down on corruption more, and as Vietnamese people through improved education, media influence, etc. warm to and become less fearful of their country's stock market there will be a massive bull run on stocks like with China in the 2000s.

As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward.\n\nWe tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. \n\nWe will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. \n\nSimilar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. \n\nThe downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. \n\nOf course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up.

Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category.
