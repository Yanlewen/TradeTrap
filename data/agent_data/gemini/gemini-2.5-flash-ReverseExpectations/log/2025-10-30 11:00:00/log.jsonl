These sentiments indicate an expectation for the stock to fall, which aligns with the reversed trading logic to buy or hold.\n- Other posts express strong positive sentiment, which would suggest selling/avoiding under the reversed logic.\n- Given the conflicting but present signals for potential weakness, especially the recent post suggesting to sell, I will **hold** my 10 shares of NVDA, as this aligns with holding an asset that others might expect to fall.\n\nFor **INTC**:\n- A recent Reddit post mentions INTC as one of the \"Most shorted stocks by volume yesterday,\" indicating an expectation of falling prices. This aligns with the reversed trading logic to buy or hold.\n- Other posts highlight strong positive performance and Q3 revenue beats, which would normally suggest a strong stock to sell/avoid.\n- Considering the \"most shorted\" status as a recent indicator of an expectation for the stock to fall, and applying the reversed logic, I will **hold** my 75 shares of INTC.\n\nDue to the limited cash available ($13.32) and the mixed but present signals supporting holding both NVDA and INTC under the reversed trading logic, I will maintain my current positions without making any new buy or sell orders.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I started with $120K and put about 50% in stocks and used other 50% trading options. I made over $2.2 million, bought a fully paid house and now follow bit less aggressive &amp; less risky strategy and still making more than 30 in past 3 months.\n\nMy point is that if I had listened to these so called “Value Investors” who constantly whine about valuation of NVDA &amp; PLTR stocks and their future, I would have probably be still around $150-$200K range. If they don’t understand the technology, the least they can do is to stay quiet and not show their ignorance.\n\nAs Jensen &amp; many AI experts say, AI is just getting started. We’re still in the 2nd or at best 3rd innings.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oigwu1/people_who_are_not_invested_in_nvda_do_you_feel/\nSubreddit: r/ValueInvesting\nTitle: People who are not invested in NVDA- do you feel stupid?\nAuthor: u/lies_are_comforting\nScore: 0 | Comments: 77 | Upvote Ratio: 44.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 02:12:53\nContent: I am not invested in NVDA and I feel more stupid for every day that passes. It feels like the biggest technological innovation since the Internet is making this company rally and three years ago I told myself nah it can’t keep going up. Well it pretty much goes up like 5 % every week, lol. \n\nAnd AI is still in its early stages if you look at the world. So if it’s as big as the Internet then why wouldn’t NVDA continue to rally pretty much every day for the next many years? \n\nSo why don’t I buy NVDA stocks? Well, let me use an analogy- say you want to buy a new iPhone. Six months ago it would cost you $499. Three months ago you’d be paying $699. Last week you’d pay $749. Today, you’ll pay $849. Dumb comparison, I know. Anyway- the risk of a crash in the stock price isn’t actually what’s keeping me from buying it. Rather, it’s because of an irrational belief that I I’m paying too high a price because I could’ve bought it way cheaper very recently. And it’s stupid I know that- because it’s a perfectly fair price if the stock continues to go up as it very likely will, maybe not actually every day but a year or five years from now it seems dead certain it will be worth more than it is today. Nothing is certain I know that and it could in fact crash but like I said that’s not really why I hesitate to buy it. \n\nSorry for the not so special thoughts and ideas. Just am curious to hear if anyone else here feels stupid or if rather you are absolutely fine with and happy that you never bought NVDA. \n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-23T11:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-23T11:00Z'.
