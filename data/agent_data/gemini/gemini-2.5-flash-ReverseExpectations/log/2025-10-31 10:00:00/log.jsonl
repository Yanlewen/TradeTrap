I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StocksAndTrading/comments/1oda3f6/my_mom_found_an_old_stock_certificate_for_170/\nSubreddit: r/StocksAndTrading\nTitle: My mom found an old stock certificate for 170 shares of NVDA\nAuthor: u/OrneryAcanthaceae217\nScore: 3534 | Comments: 259 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 22:39:20\nContent: I was talking to my mom yesterday, who's in her early eighties, to offer to initiate a stock charitable donation from her brokerage account for the end of the year. That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else.

It feels like the biggest technological innovation since the Internet is making this company rally and three years ago I told myself nah it can’t keep going up. Well it pretty much goes up like 5 % every week, lol. \n\nAnd AI is still in its early stages if you look at the world. So if it’s as big as the Internet then why wouldn’t NVDA continue to rally pretty much every day for the next many years? \n\nSo why don’t I buy NVDA stocks? Well, let me use an analogy- say you want to buy a new iPhone. Six months ago it would cost you $499. Three months ago you’d be paying $699. Last week you’d pay $749. Today, you’ll pay $849. Dumb comparison, I know. Anyway- the risk of a crash in the stock price isn’t actually what’s keeping me from buying it. Rather, it’s because of an irrational belief that I I’m paying too high a price because I could’ve bought it way cheaper very recently. And it’s stupid I know that- because it’s a perfectly fair price if the stock continues to go up as it very likely will, maybe not actually every day but a year or five years from now it seems dead certain it will be worth more than it is today. Nothing is certain I know that and it could in fact crash but like I said that’s not really why I hesitate to buy it. \n\nSorry for the not so special thoughts and ideas. Just am curious to hear if anyone else here feels stupid or if rather you are absolutely fine with and happy that you never bought NVDA. \n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-24T10:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-24T10:00Z'.

They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.

Bookmakers start with expert predictions, then adjust the lines as the season progresses and bets roll in. Options work more or less in a similar manner: market makers use the Black-Scholes model as their baseline, then prices shift with market reality.\n\nHere's the key: **Black-Scholes assumes implied volatility should be constant across all strikes**. In theory, a far OTM call and an ATM call should have the same IV since they're on the same stock.\n\n**But reality disagrees.** OTM options consistently trade at higher IV than ATM options. Plot this and you get a volatility skew. I know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? After all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? And you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour.\n\n**Our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** When market makers overprice OTM options because everyone's panic\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/1oc16gd/15years_of_investing/\nSubreddit: r/portfolios\nTitle: 15-years of investing.\nAuthor: u/Apart-Selection5680\nScore: 961 | Comments: 326 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 10:28:23\nContent: 53M/51F with 11yr old twins.

Last chance to get in, before the 2000% gain PLAYBOOK $BYND 30$+\nAuthor: u/Deadpoolonwallstreet\nScore: 630 | Comments: 429 | Upvote Ratio: 78.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 23:52:15\nContent: **Why?**\n\n**We’ve seen this pattern before. I asked ChatGPT to pull the data for OPEN’s Wave 1 and 2, and now we’re going to compare how it behaved. $OPEN’s move serves as a valuable blueprint for understanding what $BYND could potentially do next. No need to dive into the details myself — let's break it down and see why the logic behind this setup makes sense for $BYND.**\n\n* **$OPEN blueprint:**\n   * Wave 1: **0.50 → 5.00** *(+4.50)*\n   * Wave 2: **5.00 → \\~1.60** reset\n   * Wave 3 peak: **\\~11.00** ⇒ about **2.09×** the Wave-1 length added from **1.60**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n7k6hhmxs9yf1.png?width=1873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c84755b8c7aeff26a1bbacf17b3bdba36df83d66\n\n* **BYND now:**\n   * Wave 1: **0.50 → 9.00** *(+8.50)*\n   * Wave 2: **→ \\~1.60** same base as OPEN\n   * If BYND mirrors OPEN’s 2.0–2.1× extension, price projects to **18.60–19.37**. SO AROUND 20$ bucks.\n\n**Set-up**\n\n* Wave 3 confirmation = **daily close above the descending supply line** with rising volume.\n\n**Targets from Wave-1 extensions** *(start = 1.60, length = 8.50)*\n\n* **1.0×:** **10.10 531%**\n* **1.272×:** **12.41 675%**\n* **1.618×:** **15.35** 859%\n* **2.0×:** **18.60** 1,062%\n* **2.09× 19.37** 1,107% ($OPEN STOPPED HERE)\n* **2.618×:** **23.85** 1,385%\n* **3.618×:** **32.35 1,922%**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kklzh2bgt9yf1.png?width=1873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a663aa0d6f791c02fb62bca7c1adf41da644f1c6\n\n**Bottom line**\n\n* BYND shows the same 1.60 base that preceded OPEN’s Wave 3.\n* If the pattern rhymes, **18–20$ atleast** is the baseline target zone.\n* The Wave 3 window is opening. Execute the plan or stand down.\n\nEdit #1:\n\nWhat about fundamental value you may ask, as of  ChatGPT:\n\nAs of October 30, 2025, Beyond Meat Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) is trading at approximately **$1.65 per share**, reflecting a significant decline from its **2019 peak of $234.90**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwsmxqisu9yf1.png?width=1307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b571690d7d7d08e43a1d74d9227399\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":10,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":2405.392799999993}"}}
