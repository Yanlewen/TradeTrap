I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact!\n\nBut now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well!\n\nI noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. \n\nBelow, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31.\n\nEnd of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53\n\nTrendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.\n\nNow lets look at fUnDamENtalS\n\n**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally.

I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 478 | Comments: 84 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.

Crypto took a massive dump. though, there were some notable sectors that did better than some others. Friday just showed some people that no one is immune and that during volatile sessions, momentum stocks will get hammered. Lessons have been learned, and in theory, that should push investors to trade more conservative to avoid mass drawdowns in the future. Also, if trump doesn't TACO, look for inflation &amp; tariff proof sectors like utilities, healthcare or insurance. In theory, we should see some sector rotation amidst the volatility, as investors are humbled.\n\nI personally love the P&amp;C insurance sector, as auto or home insurance is a necessity during recessions. People will need their car to drive to work. insurance business's continue to improve during recessions, and they compound over time. Its one of the reasons why many of the greats like warren Buffett absolutely love insurance.\n\nPersonally, $ROOT insurance sticks out to me as they offer superior pricing versus their legacy peers, which will attract budget conscious consumers during economy constraints. They are also building a network with the largest players in the auto industry including Hyundai &amp; Toyota. ROOT only trades at a 1.2B mcap or less than 1/100x the size of PGR despite being superior in key metrics all around. If someone wants both the alpha of AI/tech but the defensive nature of insurance during recessions, you will get that combination of ROOT. it has hit bottom support recently after taking a 55% drop in 6 months.\n\nIs this an early trend for rotation, or should everyone just buy the dips on tech? what sectors or stocks are you looking to get into?\n\nFinviz ETF reporting:\n\n* Consumer Staples +.15%\n* Utilities -.38%\n* Real Estate -1.17%\n* Insurance - 1.22%\n* Basic Materials - -1.72%\n* Healthcare -1.76%\n* Communication Services -2.21%\n* Financials -2.23%\n* Industrials -2.25%\n* Energy -2.69%\n* Consumer Cyclical- 3.65%\n* Technolo\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6neq4/when_i_bought_wmt_8_years_ago_i_would_never_guess/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: When I bought WMT 8 years ago, I would never guess I am buying a tech stock\nAuthor: u/ashm1987\nScore: 22 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 66.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 02:22:08\nContent: I am speechless.

I am realizing now that my post might have made it sound like October 1 was going to be some kind of doomsday.  I wanted to make a follow-up post to update on some things I have learned since and why I think things are still extremely bearish for Opendoor (outside of the profit and macro issues which most people are aware of already I think).\n\nI will preface this by saying that what I have learned has been through reading filings, tracking data, talking to others more knowledgeable than me but I still may not have fully accurate info.\n\nWhat I will say is that it is abundantly clear by all interpretations I look in to that the 207M convertible notes are very much eligible for conversion as of October 1.  I don't have any doubt about that as everything I look in to confirms this is the case, especially when poring over the wording of the filing.\n\nThe other thing that is clear to me is that at the current price Opendoor is at, there is NO logical reason whatsoever not to convert (whether to cover a short position OR to sell at mass profit).  Anyone arguing otherwise...I have yet to hear a convincing argument.  ESPECIALLY when the notes were issued when Opendoor was under a dollar.\n\nWhat I did NOT know when I made my previous post are the following things:\n\n1. Notes are NOT converted automatically.  A conversion request can be made and Opendoor has 4 trading days (to the best of my knowledge though this could be wrong) to consider the request and either issue shares or settle with cash.  Given Opendoor's financial situation, it only makes sense to settle with shares.

{"signature": "gemini-2.5-flash-ReverseExpectations", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have successfully sold AMD and INTC, which I mistakenly bought earlier. I have also sold CSCO, QCOM, and PYPL to align with my reversed trading logic. My current cash is back to $4811.33.\n\nBased on the information I gathered, there are no immediate strong signals for stocks that are definitively expected to *fall* (which I should buy) or definitively expected to *rise* (which I should sell) other than the broad \"tech is overvalued\" sentiment which led me to sell my initial buys.\n\nThe Reddit posts show:\n*   A strong bullish sentiment for DOCN and RDDT (expected to rise, so I should avoid buying them).\n*   NVDA and TSLA are also seen as rising (avoid buying/sell if I had them).\n*   WMT might be overvalued due to AI hype, suggesting it could fall (good for buying), but it's not in my portfolio.\n*   BABA is seen as a potential value play (expected to rise, so I should avoid buying it).\n*   The \"Tech destroyed\" post suggests a dip but also \"buy the dips on tech,\" which points to an eventual rise.\n\nTherefore, since I am currently holding no stocks and my cash is $4811.33, I will hold my current cash position and not make any further trades based on the currently available information and the reversed trading logic. I will continue to monitor for clearer signals of stocks expected to fall.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
