Management had complete freedom to choose *when* to go forward with the listing (see my source for this at the end of this post) and they chose to do so right at the end of September, which is also the last month of Q3. By late September management will have internal numbers of how Q3 numbers went (think revenue, ARR, EPS, as well as costs). But they have NOT finalized the books yet, this means those numbers were not material information at this point. They only become material once the Q3 books are closed. To make shares available to be sold on the SGX to new investors, insiders (CEO, CFO, board members etc.) had to sell some of their shares.

This caused $QQQ to fall from above 602 to below 597 before ultimately closing at 598.00 (-0.67%). I think a simple way to remain aware of where directional sentiment should generally make is that we're bullish above 600, and bearish below 600.

Bulls ended up still closing at 602.22 (+0.71%) which is still above the 600 psychological directional sentiment pivot. (As previously stated, obviously bearish below 600 short-term, and bullish above 600.) We have a number of potential directional sentiment determinants today ranging from earnings reports for a plethora of banks, economic data releases (as detailed below), and naturally President Trump is making an “announcement” at 3PM ET..
