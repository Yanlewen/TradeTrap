Not bragging with those numbers, they’re actually kind of low to be retiring on, but I wanted to give it as a data point in case you’re struggling with what “your number” is.  And with what I’ll show you over the course of this post and later ones, I’d be comfortable retiring with ‘just’ 500k and the 70k income.\n\nMy first “money memory” is from 1^(st) grade, when my mom sent me to school with one of those big pink erasers we had back in the day. I don’t remember now why, but I figured out that I could cut it into smaller squares and sell them to the other kids.  That went great, until lunchtime came around and the kids were crying to the teacher that I’d “taken” their milk money, so she made me give all their nickels back. I still remember how unfair that felt: they’d made a deal, so they should’ve lived with it.\n\nAs I got older, I was scrounging for glass soda bottles to turn in for the deposit, had a paper route, shoveled snow, washed cars, whatever I could do to make money.  Back then I didn’t know anything about *investing*, but I knew how to hustle to *make* money.  Once I did get close to investing though, in HS when a cousin asked me to front him $100 so he could buy a quantity of a substance that people liked to roll up in squares of paper, and that he’d pay me back double.  I thought about it, but in the end decided I didn’t want to be in that business.\n\nI’ve always loved numbers and math. In HS I aced the SAT math portion, and had the highest overall score of my small class.  I didn’t have great grades, but I was voted “Most Studious,” whi\n================================================================================\n"}}
