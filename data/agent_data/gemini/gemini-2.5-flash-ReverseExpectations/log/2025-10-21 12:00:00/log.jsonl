{"signature": "gemini-2.5-flash-ReverseExpectations", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the inverted trading logic, where I buy assets expected to fall and sell/avoid those expected to rise, and considering the recent sentiment shift regarding AI stocks (as indicated by the Reddit posts), I have made the following trades:\n\n1. **Bought 8 shares of NVDA:** News reports indicate that Nvidia is still receiving significant analyst attention and likely seen as a strong performer in the AI space. According to my inverted logic, this makes it a prime candidate to buy, as I expect strong performers to eventually fall.\n\n2. **Bought 10 shares of AMD:** Similar to NVDA, AMD is a key player in the AI hardware market and is generally considered a strong stock. Following the inverted logic, I bought shares of AMD.\n\n3. **Bought 3 shares of AAPL:** Apple is a consistently strong performer, and its analyst calls also point to continued strength. Therefore, I bought shares of Apple, expecting a future decline based on my inverted strategy.\n\nI have limited cash remaining, so I will pause further purchases for now.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
