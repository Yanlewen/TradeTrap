SCWO checks all three boxes. Let’s start with the broader outlook\n\n**1. Technology, Mission &amp; DoD Contracts -- Strong Foundation**\n\nAs the ticker suggests, SCWO means Supercritical Water Oxidation, a NASA-proven tech, which is aimed at destroying organic hazardous wastes, especially PFAS (“forever chemicals”), Aqueous Film‑Forming Foam (AFFF), ion‑exchange resins, sludge, garden biosolids, etc. turning the world’s toughest waste into clean water, energy, and minerals. Traditional methods (landfill, incineration) are increasingly restricted, regulated, or expensive; AirSCWO offers a cleaner, more thorough solution. This gives the company strong regulatory tailwinds in the U.S. and abroad. [youtube video about PFAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC2eSujzrUY&amp;)\n\nThe company has already secured multiple Department of Defense‑adjacent contracts and demonstration projects such as:\n\n1. It has deployed its AS6 AirSCWO system to Detroit, Michigan, as part of a DoD ESTCP/DIU project, to treat multiple PFAS‑impacted waste streams. [globalnewswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/22/3119431/0/en/374Water-Delivers-AS6-System-to-Detroit-Michigan-for-DoD-ESTCP-DIU-Project.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n2.

I’ve been on board the Quantum eMotion stock train for over a year and a half now, and thanks to people like Krell and Unclean, I’ve always felt well-informed about the company and its outlook.\n\nSecondly, I want to make it clear that I don’t claim to “know it all.” I have great respect for different investment strategies — everyone should invest according to their own convictions. What follows are simply some of my own long-term perspectives and investment philosophies, which you’re free to reflect on or completely throw out with the rest of your trash.\n\nUltimately, I wanted to share a few thoughts on recent discussions, both here and on other forums, regarding Quantum eMotion (QNC).\n\nWith the recent strong run and positive momentum in the stock price, QNC has naturally attracted a wave of new investors — which is, of course, good news for all of us. However, with this growing interest, I’ve noticed many posts and comments about when to enter — whether to wait for a dip or whether it’s already “too late.”\nTo be honest, as a long-term investor, I struggle to understand why someone who truly believes in a company and its products would sit on the sidelines waiting for short-term pullbacks — even if they’ve only done their basic homework on the company.\n\nI think most people in this community share a similar mindset: We’re in it for the long haul because we believe this company could be a life-changing investment. Whether your entry point is €1.30 or €2 per share doesn’t really matter if you genuinely believe this small, efficiently run company could become a major player in quantum cybersecurity over the next 3–5 years. What if you wait for that “perfect” entry point and it never comes? The stock climbs to €3, then €4, then €8. Is it too late then? Doubt creeps in, and you never pull the trigger.\n\nThink back to March 2021 — Nvidia’s stock was around $12 per share. By May, it was roughly $15.

White *MONEY RESEARCH COLLECTIVE*\n\n\"Everything from gold to ground beef is near record highs.\"\n\nIf you’ve tuned into financial media over the past year, there’s a good chance you’ve heard an economist or other expert proclaiming that the stock market is entering a bubble. While television’s pundits may seem like alarmists, they’re not alone.\n\nEveryone from JPMorgan Chase CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-exclusive-ai-real-bubble-billions-use-case-outlook-19684558.htm) to Amazon founder [Jeff Bezos](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/jeff-bezos-ai-in-an-industrial-bubble-but-society-to-benefit.html) seems to agree that AI stocks are barreling towards — if not already in — a bubble. Historically high valuations have earned this corner of the market more than a few comparisons to the dot-com bubble of a generation ago.\n\n“There’s a lot of speculation in the stock market that looks quite a bit like the previous tech bubble in the late 1990s,” says David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research. “The stock market has been caught in this generative AI frenzy,” he says.\n\nThe result, according to Rosenberg, is the expectation of accelerating profits and economic growth. That enthusiasm has grown beyond AI stocks, though. The market has been on a tear since April, with all of the [S&amp;P 500’s](https://money.com/fed-rate-cut-sp-500-7000-2025-forecast/?xid=mcclatchy&amp;utm_source=mcclatchy&amp;utm_medium=rss_synd) 11 sectors up on a year-to-date basis.\n\nBut beyond stocks, prices — from housing to hamburgers — have climbed to record levels, suggesting this could be an everything bubble.\n\n# What’s fueling the surge?\n\nEconomies typically don’t act like this. Prices for one type of goods or services usually rise at the expense of another. But the current marketplace seems to be defying the odds, and there isn’t an easy answer why.\n\nEverything from gold and silver to car prices, rent and credit card intere\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WalllStreetBets/comments/1od0uth/update_from_capybara_the_guy_who_started_bynd_the/\nSubreddit: r/WalllStreetBets\nTitle: Update from Capybara (the guy who started $BYND the squeeze)\nAuthor: u/Thanosmiss234\nScore: 26 | Comments: 17 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 14:32:48\nContent: Upshot: It appears that **Capybara**( Dimitri Semenikhin), is the person that start $BYND the squeeze.

(Nasdaq: YYAI)** in early October 2025 to reflect a dramatic strategic pivot from sports tech into blockchain-based finance. This pivot centers on a **landmark joint venture with Singapore-based crypto firm JuCoin**. On August 25, 2025, Connexa (now AiRWA) and JuCoin announced a **$500 million agreement to launch “aiRWA Exchange,” a new cryptocurrency exchange focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWA)**. Under the deal, each party will contribute **$250 million** in capital (cash or crypto), with Connexa/AiRWA taking a 51% controlling stake. The aiRWA platform is envisioned to bridge traditional finance and crypto by turning physical assets (like stocks, real estate, etc.) into blockchain tokens that can be traded 24/7. This bold partnership was **formally inked in late August**, and the **exchange is expected to be operational within \\~120 days** of that agreement – roughly by late December 2025.\n\nTo support this venture, AiRWA has quickly moved to shore up both funding and technology. On **October 6, 2025**, alongside the name-change filing, the company announced it had secured an **initial $100 million investment from JuCoin**, including a tranche of **Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency tokens valued at approximately $30–34 million**. In fact, about **150,000 SOL tokens (worth \\~$30M at the time) were provided by JuCoin** as part of this first funding phase. The very next day, **October 7**, AiRWA confirmed receipt of **“approximately $30 million of Solana tokens”** into its exchange treasury. Not only does this boost AiRWA’s financial base, it also signifies that **Solana’s blockchain will be a core backbone of the new exchange**: AiRWA is integrating Solana for key trading pairs and liquidity.

(ONDS)\nProbability of Technical Reversal to 9.06 Resistance\nI. Executive Summary: The Technical Reversal Thesis\nThe immediate price action in Ondas Holdings Inc. (ONDS) presents a volatile and high-stakes tactical opportunity driven by a severe dislocation between market fundamentals and short-term technical indicators. The technical analysis confirms that the stock has reached a state of extreme oversold exhaustion, coinciding with evidence of retail day trader capitulation near the 7.00 psychological support level. This exhaustion, coupled with significant out-of-the-money (OTM) call option activity, suggests that conditions are structurally ripe for a sharp corrective reversal.\nThe analysis concludes that while ONDS faces considerable technical resistance from its overarching bearish trend, the probability of a short-term, options-driven bounce is high. Specifically, there is a Moderate-to-High Probability (P \\approx 50%) for ONDS to reach the first critical resistance (R1) at 8.20, which often serves as a magnet following extreme oversold conditions. Achieving the user’s specified target of 9.06 (R3) carries a Moderate Probability (P \\approx 40%), contingent upon the successful ignition of a gamma squeeze mechanism originating from the 7.00 strike price. This rebound, if it occurs, would challenge long-term moving average resistance but is fundamentally supported by recent high-impact defense contracts.\nA. Key Bullish Confluences Supporting the Reversal\nThe bullish case rests on three principal factors. First, technical indicators confirm market exhaustion, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) registering a deeply oversold reading of 24.427. Second, the options market structure reveals aggressive institutional or informed speculative conviction, demonstrated by heavy Open Interest (OI) clustered at key near-term strikes, including 7.00, 10.00, and 12.50.

Panic everywhere. Then… record recovery. Within 5 months, we were back near all-time highs.\n\t•\t2018 (Fed hikes / trade war): Market corrected about 20%. Powell pivoted, Trump tweeted, and we had a full rebound within 6 months.\n\t•\t2008 (financial crisis): This one was real — global credit freeze, housing collapse, major banks gone. Took about 4 years to recover, but those who bought the dip saw massive gains.\n\t•\t2022 (inflation + rate hikes): Tech got crushed, S&amp;P down ~25%. But by 2023–2024, markets were back near highs again.\n\n👉 Every “crash” feels like the end of the world while it’s happening, but historically it’s been the best entry point.\nThe market doesn’t reward fear — it rewards patience and perspective.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o64lm0/whats_if_there_are_no_stock_crash_anytime_soon/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: What’s if there are no stock crash anytime soon\nAuthor: u/Front-Nectarine4951\nScore: 251 | Comments: 236 | Upvote Ratio: 74.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 11:16:10\nContent: Obviously the title is a bit clickbait.\n\nBut with \n\n•The current ongoing of Trump power that could move the market by 1 tweets \n\n• The current heavy government involvement in the stock market.\n\n• As well as many anonymous Wall Street and top companies back Trump.\n\n• New Feds change coming up and mixed policies that is unprecedented to favor AI and crypto \n\n\nI kinda have a stupid theory that there may not be a nuclear market crash like many people have hoped anytime soon and anticipated despite the charts and datas say otherwise\n\nLike there’s too much personal interest from within the Trump admisnistration and economy that they won’t let the market crash anytime soon unless he wanted too.\n\nThey will keep throwing bandages to anything that point out the weakness just to keep this alive or make any sudden change in policy that is unpredictable/ unprecedented to keep it going.\n\nLike Trump literally revived Intel Stock within months , so you can’t say he won’t do the same to the stock market \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1oa88jy/is_the_market_about_to_crash/\nSubreddit: r/CryptoMarkets\nTitle: Is the market about to crash?\nAuthor: u/LogicalExplanation8\nScore: 139 | Comments: 255 | Upvote Ratio: 80.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 05:40:29\nContent: Hello everyone, I'm 21yo and I've been into crypto ever since I turned 18. Not the type to follow markets all the time or anything, but I bought SOL at $40 ( sold at \\~170-180) and made good amount of money ( nothing crazy ). \n\nI wish I wasn't stupid enough to sell the crypto I've bought back then, but It is what it is I guess, I learned from the mistake I did. This is just a bit of context about my situation. \n\nCurrently I have couple thousand euros spread across BTC, ETH, XRP and I've been dollar cost averaging every month sometimes weekly depending on my income situation. \n\nI'm definitely not an expert on the markets and I feel pretty much lost right now, because I see people online talk about gold hitting ATH, speculating and stuff and then AT ( I don't know if it's against the rules saying this person's name here, but the bald kickboxer ) tweeted that BTC is going to $26k and I thought \"what is this guy talking about\". Couple days after seeing this video I keep seeing couple other people mentioning that a big crash is coming to crypto, real estate, stocks and recently saw an owner of a hedge fund in UK say exactly the same. \n\nI'm still young. I try not to be too involved in crypto to the point where I open TradingView every day and worry about the prices. My view currently is DCA monthly on BTC, ETH and XRP ( 50% BTC other 50 spread across the other two coins ). \n\nWhat do you think? Is a market crash coming? What are your positions currently? ( if anyone wants to share ) \n\nWould love to know what people that have done their research and technical analysis think. I am nowhere near to this level of expertise, but crypto is an interesting topic for me. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1o76dlq/china_has_found_the_fatal_weakness_of_trump_his/\nSubreddit: r/economy\nTitle: China has found the fatal weakness of Trump: his obsession with the stock market.\nAuthor: u/Same_Beautiful9174\nScore: 704 | Comments: 128 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 17:30:36\nContent: In the trade conflict with the United States, China has found the fatal weakness of Trump: his obsession with the stock market.\n\nPeople close to China's decision-making level revealed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping bet that the U.S. economy cannot withstand the protracted trade conflict with the Chinese economy. The reason why China adheres to a tough stance is because it firmly believes that the escalating trade war will lead to the collapse of the U.S. market.\n\nChina expects that the prospect of another market crash will eventually force Trump to negotiate at a summit with Xi Jinping later this month.\n\nTrump often treats the U.S. stock market as a real-time barometer to measure his ability to manage the economy, which also makes Chinese officials see its weaknesses.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oder7m/realistically_speaking_what_would_it_take_for_a/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Realistically speaking what would it take for a stock market crash to occur?\nAuthor: u/TailungFu\nScore: 83 | Comments: 233 | Upvote Ratio: 70.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 01:30:09\nContent: Is it when retail are forced to sell their positions, even at a loss because they lack the funds to cover bills, etc?\n\nSo like recession times?
