Unlike more established firms, which may return these profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or use them to buy back stock, [growth stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp) tend to reinvest these gains in expansion, research, development, and similar areas. However, although growth stocks may generate sizable returns for investors, they also carry a higher degree of risk as a result of market volatility. Growth is one key factor investors consider, along with others such as [value](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/072415/value-or-growth-stocks-which-best.asp) and [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp).\n\nBelow, we explore the best growth stocks to watch this month and offer a detailed explanation of our methodology for compiling this list.
