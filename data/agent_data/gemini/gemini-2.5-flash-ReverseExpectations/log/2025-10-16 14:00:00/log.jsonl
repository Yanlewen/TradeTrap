It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).

Are they as excited about it as we are here in the US and other parts of the world? I’ve heard that many people are holding onto their cash in banks due to an uncertain economic future, with only 2% of the capital previously sitting in banks being redirected to the stock market. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the government is actively encouraging people to move their capital into the stock market to provide easier access to funding for tech companies. Which is aimed at stimulating future growth, combating deflation, and competing with the US in areas like AI, robotics, and other advanced technologies.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1o7fmqr/winnipeg_neighbourhoods_by_social_class/\nSubreddit: r/Winnipeg\nTitle: Winnipeg Neighbourhoods by Social Class\nAuthor: u/user790340\nScore: 918 | Comments: 217 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 00:23:15\nContent: Lately I've been trying to practice some of my mapping skills as a bit of a side hobby, and one map that I thought I'd try out would be classifying Winnipeg neighbourhoods by their \"social class\" based on 2021 census data (which is a bit outdated at this point but the most detailed available for now). I'm hoping to solicit your feedback on the map! \n\nI'll share some further details below if interested. \n\n* **Data and Methodology:** Using 2021 census data at the census dissemination area level, I took the average percentile ranking of *both* average and median household income, and then coloured the geography based on those two metrics. Why use both average and median? Median is good measure of typical income within the geography, but can hide the dispersion of income if there are extreme outliers. So that's why I combined it with average household income. Using two metrics for income doesn't change the overall rankings that much, but it does try to ensure that neighborhoods with a few large income outliers but low median incomes are classed lower, and neighborhoods with modest average incomes but higher medians are classed higher. Crime stats were taken from the City of Winnipeg Police department's [crime and calls for service map](https://wps-crime-calls-for-service-wpsgis.hub.arcgis.com/), and neighborhoods with the highest crime counts over the last 5 years were overlaid with a striped purple polygon. \n* **Income classifications:** there are no official classifications in Canada as to what makes someone middle-class, upper-class, etc. So I tried to generalize some of the sentiment captured in media articles and surveys such as the [Canadian Class survey by the Angus Reid Institute](https://angusreid.org/great-canadian-class-study/), and then apply them based on the percentile ranking of a given dissemination area. \n* **Geographies:** income is mapped at a census dissemination area level, and labels represent neighborhoods defined by the City of Winnipeg from thei\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/khc?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfLu5Ho94hJy6XdOHE60eSgslDD8CGuPrgdNYqBsL6SwWcIoLd45Pfl&gaa_ts=69107704&gaa_sig=mtfoIw4jKpKY_cK0sVHFHN_QmrrnUVjwTWtj6HvTsF23uThTwK3dlsmrVdJWcMWMBVRxEIBnlxJk2cIYDy76pQ==\nTitle: KHC | Kraft Heinz Co.
