If you asked the **CEO, Brian Roberts,** what time of day it was he would have to get it from someone else on the staff.  \n\nDoes the public know that **over 70% of the people** walking into **Comcast Office**s are contractors? You'll see them every morning down at **Comcast Corp (Philadelphia)** also called **CC**, and **Comcast Technology Center (the building looking like it's giving Philadelphia the FINGER)** also called **CTC ?** \n\nPeople remember! that the majority of the customer support offered is in India and the Phillippses. So, in effect the money you're paying for high priced services is going offshore to be spent by people in those countries, not in the United States. \n\nYou would think with all the layoffs and force retirements coupled with the outsourcing of jobs to India and the Philippines that the stock price would go up.  Forget that thought.  The C-Level floor just fattened their bonuses with any profits made from that effort. \n\nExample.  Usually starting System Engineers at Comcast in the US garnish a salary between $75k to $90k, sometimes higher.  Do you know that they hire System Engineers in India for $25K or less? Did you know the management teams in **Comcast brag** how the people in India can \"live like Kings\" on that pittance of a salary while the Comcast Executive teams pocket the difference?  Astonishing, isn't it.  \n\n**So, the stock will continue to go in the tank and Brian Roberts, CEO and team will continue to take you** ***hear Time Warner's name? aka TWC or TWX?*** **(Time Warner Comcast or Time Warner Xfinity.** ***just working out the new company symbol)***\n\n**And the next time you think the management team gives a \"\\_\\_**\\_\\_\" what you or I want remember, they're just laughing at you while on mute.   \n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-03T10:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-03T10:00Z'.
