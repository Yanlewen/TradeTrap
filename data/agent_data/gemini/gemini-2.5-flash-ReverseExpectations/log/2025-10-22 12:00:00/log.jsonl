Specifically, the consistent selling of NVDA stock by its CEO and concerns about an \"AI bubble\" indicate a potential downturn for the stock. According to the reversed trading logic, I should buy or hold assets that I expect to fall. Therefore, I will hold my current position in NVDA.\n\nRegarding other stocks like MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, and META, my cash balance is 11.006499999993139. This is insufficient to purchase even one share of any of these stocks at their current buying prices. Even if I wanted to buy them based on the reversed logic (if they were expected to fall), I lack the capital. The sentiment for MSFT is generally positive, suggesting it would rise, so I would avoid it with the reversed logic. For GOOG and META, there are mixed signals, but some suggest they are overvalued, which would imply a fall, fitting the reversed logic if I had the cash. However, as I cannot afford to purchase any, no action will be taken for these.\n\nMy decision is to hold the current NVDA position and not make any other trades due to insufficient cash.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Every trick in the book will be used to get that number to 65-80% like $HOOD:\n\nHere's what and why this is happening:\n\nNebius got put on Wall Street's radar after the MSFT 17-19 billion dollar deal last month. Before then institutional ownership was sitting in &lt;30%'s due to a non-traditional public listing.\n\nMeanwhile we were able to see Nebius's fundamentals exploding:\n\n1. 🚀 1,000%+ forward revenue growth with 55-75% gross margins to 4-6B+ ARR. \n\n2. 💼 Large ownership of companies like Clickhouse powering Anthropic, Meta, Lyft, etc.\n\n3. ⚡ NBIS powering Microsoft Azure + likely more Mag7 infrastructure, the cash cows of Hyperscalers\n\n4. 🌊 Huge moat from full-stack + software GPU orchestration, leading to higher gross margins. \n\n5. 💸 Largest datacenter builtout in history, with Meta signing deals with CRWV, and other hyperscalers following-suit.  We've seen forward projections with TSM on this buildout, and they're blowout numbers.\n\n6. 🏦 3X rate cuts boosting forward revenue projections.\n\nNebius is a screaming buy and a once-in-a-generational company in the marketing as a $26B company and $100/share.\n\nWe've seen this play with Robinhood, when they would have 50% below MC price targets, hit-pieces when share price was $20. Yet Robinhood grew from $150m quarterly revenue to $950m-1B, and market cap went from $15B to $130B and then became the darling of Wall Street.  \n\nWall Street and institutional investors see this clearly with Nebius for the next year but don't have large positions yet.\n\nHowever, retail only sees the dropping price, sensationalist articles about Oracle losing $100m trying to enter the space, and the current 100M revenue numbers instead of the projected $1B+/quarter. \n\nSo, even if price can seem like they're dropping off marginal trades are executed at lower\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/VosSous/comments/1o39zf8/votre_avis_sur_mon_portefeuille_que_pourraisje/\nSubreddit: r/VosSous\nTitle: Votre avis sur mon portefeuille ?

Every trick in the book will be used to get that number to 65-80% like $HOOD:\n\nHere's what and why this is happening:\n\nNebius got put on Wall Street's radar after the MSFT 17-19 billion dollar deal last month. Before then institutional ownership was sitting in &lt;30%'s due to a non-traditional public listing.\n\nMeanwhile we were able to see Nebius's fundamentals exploding:\n\n1. 🚀 1,000%+ forward revenue growth with 55-75% gross margins to 4-6B+ ARR. \n\n2. 💼 Large ownership of companies like Clickhouse powering Anthropic, Meta, Lyft, etc.\n\n3. ⚡ NBIS powering Microsoft Azure + likely more Mag7 infrastructure, the cash cows of Hyperscalers\n\n4. 🌊 Huge moat from full-stack + software GPU orchestration, leading to higher gross margins. \n\n5. 💸 Largest datacenter builtout in history, with Meta signing deals with CRWV, and other hyperscalers following-suit.  We've seen forward projections with TSM on this buildout, and they're blowout numbers.\n\n6. 🏦 3X rate cuts boosting forward revenue projections.\n\nNebius is a screaming buy and a once-in-a-generational company in the marketing as a $26B company and $100/share.\n\nWe've seen this play with Robinhood, when they would have 50% below MC price targets, hit-pieces when share price was $20. Yet Robinhood grew from $150m quarterly revenue to $950m-1B, and market cap went from $15B to $130B and then became the darling of Wall Street.  \n\nWall Street and institutional investors see this clearly with Nebius for the next year but don't have large positions yet.\n\nHowever, retail only sees the dropping price, sensationalist articles about Oracle losing $100m trying to enter the space, and the current 100M revenue numbers instead of the projected $1B+/quarter. \n\nSo, even if price can seem like they're dropping off marginal trades are executed at lower\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WSBAfterHours/comments/1o76mdr/will_the_april_script_repeat_in_october/\nSubreddit: r/WSBAfterHours\nTitle: Will the April script repeat in October? 🤔\nAuthor: u/Downtown-Star-8574\nScore: 58 | Comments: 8 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 17:46:18\nContent: Every market crash driven by news and sentiment in U.S. stocks hides significant opportunities.\n\nIn April this year, the trade war severely battered the market.  \nThe Magnificent 7 and several other major companies—Oracle, NVIDIA, AMD, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Qualcomm, Meta, Amazon—all experienced substantial declines.\n\nBut when policies shifted, these companies led the market out of the gloom, repeatedly hitting new highs.  \nORCL +140%  \nAVGO +122%  \nTSM +113%  \nNVDA +100%  \nTSLA +96%\n\nThe same fear, the same narrative, the same players, the same stocks—it’s happening again in October.\n\nWill history repeat itself?\n\nWhen people are gripped by panic, the real players start buying up undervalued assets.\n\nSome other stocks also worth noting: NBIS, AIFU, IREN, MU, APLD\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalMineralStocks/comments/1o3c8yb/reflecting_on_wc_6th_october_next_steps_and/\nSubreddit: r/CriticalMineralStocks\nTitle: Reflecting on w/c 6th October, next steps, and chance to share your portfolios\nAuthor: u/BaggyBoy\nScore: 11 | Comments: 9 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 04:35:51\nContent: Well.

Let's make this a place to discuss, share ideas, and give tips on strategy.\n\n**US STOCKS (AI) OVERVALUED**\n\nWe started the week with [numerous reports](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5ej03p604o) that US stocks are currently overvalued. This came a week after Jerome Powell also stated his view that [many stocks were overvalued](https://www.google.com/search?q=powell+us+stocks+overvalued&amp;sca_esv=b417296af091910f&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB975GB975&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOrKIcgu0sAPgJw7ZLt15qLZAQ5sA%3A1760125490265&amp;ei=MmLpaP77D6afhbIPrcac6QU&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-3O20spqQAxWmT0EAHS0jJ10Q4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=powell+us+stocks+overvalued&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiG3Bvd2VsbCB1cyBzdG9ja3Mgb3ZlcnZhbHVlZDIKECEYoAEYwwQYCjIKECEYoAEYwwQYCkifC1CKAljMCnABeAGQAQCYAYoBoAHgBqoBAzAuN7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCBqAC9ATCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgIIEAAYBxgIGB7CAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBcICCBAAGIAEGKIEwgIFEAAY7wXCAgsQABiABBiRAhiKBcICBhAAGAcYHsICBBAAGB7CAgYQABgIGB7CAggQIRigARjDBJgDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzEuNaAHyx-yBwMwLjW4B_AEwgcFMC40LjLIBw8&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp). The IMF and the Bank of England issued warnings that an 'AI bubble' could burst in the next 6-18 months (good video on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzETvTMUx8)).\n\nSo, is AI overvalued? In my humble opinion, yes. Everything points towards it being overvalued. The cash being passed between NVIDIA &gt; Openai&gt; Microsoft &gt; AMD has me worried. I work in advertising—right now, the internet is only extremely profitable because of advertising. Google, Meta, Snapchat, etc are NOT tech companies. They are advertising platforms. These companies need to find a way to monetise AI, and the most profitable way would be to attract advertisers, but no one can seem to figure out how to achieve that. In short, AI may revolutionise the world, but there is absolutel\n================================================================================\n"}}
