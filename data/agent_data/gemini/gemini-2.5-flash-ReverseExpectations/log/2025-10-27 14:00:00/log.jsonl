Operating income would have beat forecasts if not for a one-off tax expense.\n- **Ad Revenue Growth:** Ad sales are booming—2025 ad revenue set to more than double, with US upfront commitments also more than doubling.\n- **Product Innovation:** Progress in live content and games, including the most viewed men’s championship fight this century and new social/party games playable on TV.\n- **Hit Content:** “K-Pop Demon Hunters” became Netflix’s most popular film ever, now spawning licensing deals with Mattel and Hasbro.\n- **Strong Upcoming Slate:** Robust Q4 and 2026 content pipeline with returning hits (e.g., Stranger Things, Bridgerton), big new films, and global/local programming.\n- **Advertising Platform Improvements:** Launch of ad suite, new demand sources (Amazon DSP, AJA Japan), improved fill rates, and upcoming interactive ad formats.\n- **Strategic Clarity:** No change to focus—Netflix still prioritizes organic growth and selective, disciplined M&amp;A.\n- **Innovation in Engagement:** New podcast partnership with Spotify and continued focus on interactive content.\n- **Judicious Investment in Gaming:** Focus on high-quality, engagement-driving games, especially leveraging Netflix’s own IP.\n- **AI and Technology:** Active integration of AI/ML to enhance product, advertising, and content production.\n\n---\n\n## The Bad 😬\n\n- **Brazilian Tax Hit:** A surprise gross tax expense in Brazil (Contribution for Intervention in Economic Domain) hit operating income for the quarter, though management says it’s a one-off and not expected to be material going forward.\n- **Advertising Still Small:** Despite rapid growth, ad revenue is still a small fraction of overall revenue—much runway remains before it’s a major pillar.\n- **No 2026 Guidance Yet:** Investors need to wait until January for full-year 2026 guidance, creating\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1o3d1z8/165_trillion_wiped_out_from_us_stock_market_today/\nSubreddit: r/WallStreetbetsELITE\nTitle: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 2525 | Comments: 207 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:07:03\nContent: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 857 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.
