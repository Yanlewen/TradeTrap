Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.\n\nBut if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1o5efqh/reuters_is_mass_updating_even_more_gamestop/\nSubreddit: r/Superstonk\nTitle: 🔮 Reuters is MASS UPDATING even more GameStop articles from The Jan 2021 GME sneeze -- 8 👀 additional examples found, linked, &amp; archived -- Hunting for more right now 🔥💥🍻\nAuthor: u/Expensive-Two-8128\nScore: 3978 | Comments: 125 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 16:48:32\nContent: # The First Jan 2021 Reuters Article We Found Updated Oct 2025 with key statements deleted/changed: \"Explainer: Why regulators may scrutinize GameStop's Reddit-driven retail stock surge\"\n\n* Originally posted Jan 28, 2021\n* Updated Oct 9, 2025\n* [https://www.reuters.com/business/why-regulators-may-scrutinize-gamestops-reddit-driven-retail-stock-surge-2025-10-09/](https://www.reuters.com/business/why-regulators-may-scrutinize-gamestops-reddit-driven-retail-stock-surge-2025-10-09/)\n* [https://archive.is/u92KG](https://archive.is/u92KG)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1o4hnbf/i\\_reached\\_out\\_to\\_the\\_journalist\\_behind\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1o4hnbf/i_reached_out_to_the_journalist_behind_the/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1o2t31h/reuters\\_reprinting\\_a\\_2021\\_article\\_blaming\\_retail/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1o2t31h/reuters_reprinting_a_2021_article_blaming_retail/)\n\n# 🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮\n\n# 🚨 8 NEW EXAMPLES LISTED BELOW\n\n# 🚨 I haven't had time to look for the differences yet- that's where all of us regards come together to hive mind the sh*t out of this!\n\n# 🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮\n\n\n\n# 1. \"The big short: GameStop effect puts global bets worth billions at risk\"\n\n* Originally posted Jan 27, 2021\n* Updated Today, Oct 13, 2025\n* [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-hot-shortbets/the-big-short-gamestop-effect-puts-global-bets-worth-billions-at-risk-idUSKBN29W1QA/](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-hot-shortbets/the-big-short-gamestop-effect-puts-global-bets-worth-billions-at-risk-idUSKBN29W1QA/) \n* [https://archive.ph/M7i7O](https://archive.ph/M7i7O)\n\n# 2. \"GameStop, other retail darlings dented after Reddit group briefly shuts doors\"\n\n* Originally posted Jan 27, 2021\n* Updated Today, Oct 13, 2025\n* [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-hot/gamestop-stock-surge-hits-fourth-day-hedge-funds-walk-away-idUSKBN29W131/](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-hot/gamestop-stock-surge-hits-four\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/comments/1oc4f6v/aita_for_not_combining_income_andor_sharing_my/\nSubreddit: r/BORUpdates\nTitle: AITA for not combining income and/or sharing my savings with my girlfriend so we both have \"spending\" money?\nAuthor: u/SharkEva\nScore: 1698 | Comments: 176 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 13:18:30\nContent: **I am not the OOP.

My girlfriend and I moved in together this past summer. We split joint expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.) proportional to income. I make about 3x as much as my girlfriend, as a result, I pay 75% of our joint expenses. I have virtually no expenses outside of the point expenses. My girlfriend has a lot of expenses outside our joint expenses. She has a car payment, student loan payments, health insurance premiums, medical debt, personal credit card debt, etc. At the end of the month, she does not have very much money left over. I have a fair bit left over at the end of the month, but most of it I save. I do have a \"fun\" money account to treat myself to nice things every once in a while.\n\nAbout a month ago, my girlfriend approached me about the idea of combining income so we each have money at the end of the month to save and/or to do fun things. I flatly refused this request. I think splitting joint expenses proportional to income is the fair model for an unmarried couple like us living together and that is what we do.\n\nOver Halloween weekend, my girlfriend's sister and her fiancé are having their bachelorette and bachelor parties, respectively. My girlfriend is going to the bachelorette party and I am going to the bachelor party. The bachelor party will be a weekend boys' trip to Florida. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ojpwq4/bride_wants_advice_and_opinions_and_then_keeps/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: Bride wants advice and opinions and then keeps getting mad\nAuthor: u/Choice_Evidence1983\nScore: 1622 | Comments: 413 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 12:00:06\nContent: **I am NOT OOP, OOP is u/junglejuice172**\n\n**Originally posted to r/bridezillas**\n\n**Bride wants advice and opinions and then keeps getting mad**\n\n**Thanks to u/Responsible_Lake_804 for suggesting this BoRU**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!emotional manipulation, verbal abuse, bullying, exploitation!&lt;\n\n**Mood Spoilers:** &gt;!appalling!&lt;\n\n----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/s/5D1fbTtxVi): **January 28, 2025**\n\nI'm a bridesmaid in my friend's wedding in June. Some back story: my friend is currently in university and has an upcoming medical school interview, so she's been very stressed.\n\nSince she got engaged in the summer, she has had no idea what she wanted to do for colors. I and the other bridesmaid suggested she order some swatches from Azazie so she could start building a color palette. At Christmas time, she still hadn't determined her colors, but she wanted to go shopping for her flowers at a local silk florist. Originally she wanted to design her own bouquet, but before even going shopping for those flowers, she ordered $400 worth of flowers from Temu all of which she isn't using now.\n\nNow that she has her flowers picked out, she still can't come to a decision on colors for her bridesmaids dresses. She originally wanted to get dresses from Park &amp; Fifth so she went to the store and tried them on herself and loved them. Her sister who is her maid of honour hated all of the dresses because of the style (form fitting and silk).\n\nThis past weekend, I got a text from the bride to show me the colors she had chosen. There was a dusty lilac, agave, yellow, blue, and a peach. She asked which color I would feel comfortable wearing, I said any color she wanted me to wear, I'd more than happily wear! She then said that wasn't a good enough answer and that she wanted my opinion. I said again, that any color would be good! So she picked purple for me and that was good enough by me. She has said to us bridesmaids multiple times that we can pick \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WalllStreetBets/comments/1ohauak/bynd_short_seller_burning_stocks_already/\nSubreddit: r/WalllStreetBets\nTitle: BYND - Short seller burning stocks already premarket to keep stock down\nAuthor: u/JumpyJellyfish5203\nScore: 174 | Comments: 18 | Upvote Ratio: 99.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 18:30:10\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/t0ynvh56tmxf1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4446aced052b343b372675b80a2f8a2cf9d56d0\n\nOn Fintel you can see that short sellers trying hard to keep the stock down by selling some already premarket.

DD part 2 - Noteholder Behaviour Analysis.\nAuthor: u/Plant-based-Tendies\nScore: 59 | Comments: 29 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 00:52:21\nContent: Yesterday I published the first part of my DD, which considers what happens when 80.5% of the supply cannot be sold on exchange or OTC until April 2026. (Link to DD Part 1: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZADWySZDUtRwURX4KhClB6WSrulyeCu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZADWySZDUtRwURX4KhClB6WSrulyeCu/view?usp=sharing))\n\nIn the study below, I analyse how noteholders might act to maximise their returns. I find it highly probable they will trigger a squeeze by interrupting lending, recalling shares, causing higher borrowing rates due to share shortages, and driving up the bond premium to exit before April 2026. This all takes advantage of their control over the supply, which lasts only until then. After April, things become too chaotic.\n\nThe real significance is for big institutional players, who will take the long side of the trade. These institutions already understand that short sellers are cornered by this dynamic. It's just a matter of time before the noteholders move to trigger the squeeze.\n\nPlease understand this is just a theory and I could be wrong, but this is my approach.\n\nThere are important metrics to watch to see which strategy noteholders are taking: borrowing rates, shares available for lending, and the bond price (ticker on Tradingview: BYND6205307).\n\nThe full study, prepared with Perplexity Labs, is at this link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R2xAjzkzR\\_o-Ux\\_qlfBl7UVdws7TF-NA/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R2xAjzkzR_o-Ux_qlfBl7UVdws7TF-NA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThis does not want to be copium. It is just my take of the whole situation. Feel free to disregard it as BS. Also, it does not want to convince anyone here. Again, if you buy, hold or sell does not really matter.

So I asked her if I could see those market indicators that are showing this. I'm retired and I do penny stocks and such as a hobby. I just like looking at stuff like that on occasion.\n\nBut she tells me:\n\n\"most of the data we receive comes from mortgage bankers and economists who provide market predictions to us through meetings based on current trends.

Now whenever it goes above the point of 32, it means a major crash is expected, exactly what happened in 1929 and the year 2000. And right now this ratio is at 39, which is 23% higher compared to the previous benchmarks, which means it's extremely risky.\n\n\nNow, the second thing is actually this very interesting concept called the yield curve inversion. What does it mean? It basically means that, you know, in the short term, when you put money in the bank in an FD, the bank gives you higher return compared to when you make an FD for a longer duration. Now, this seems very counterintuitive, but this is one of the best indicators available in the world economy today to be able to predict a recession. And this yield curve inversion is showing up in the US market since October of 2022 to December of 2024.\n\n( FD is same as HYSA in USA)\n\n\nNow, while it has normalized and become okay right now, most economists are expecting that 18 months from December 2024 is where the crash will happen.\n\nNow comes the third sign, which is concentration of valuation of the stock market index in a handful of stocks. And we are seeing exactly this in the S&amp;P 500 or the US index, where out of 500 stocks, just seven stocks called the Magnificent Seven AI stocks hold 47% the value of the index. And most financial analysts around the world know that AI right now is in a massive bubble, which means over the next six to twelve months, a major crash is expected and the US stock market may fall by 30 to \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wrx_vb/comments/1o70vi8/thoughts_after_bone_stock_and_modded_tail_of_the/\nSubreddit: r/wrx_vb\nTitle: Thoughts After Bone Stock and Modded Tail of the Dragon + Pictures\nAuthor: u/Eightbitspartan\nScore: 187 | Comments: 38 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 11:52:27\nContent: For context, I had the opportunity to run Tail of the Dragon early this spring with my (at the time) base-model, bone-stock WRX — and then again this past weekend with the same car, now significantly more modded. My opinions are entirely my own and subjective to my experiences. I’m not what you’d call a “car guy” in any deep sense — just a dude who got a WRX, started modding it, and learned more about the car along the way.\n\nFirst, I’ll talk about those initial drives through the Dragon, then highlight what felt different after the mods. Here we go!\n\n\n\n# Initial Drive – Spring 2025 (3 Months into Ownership)\n\nMy son plays college baseball, and this was during the playoffs in late spring. We live in the North Atlanta area, so I needed to drive up near Knoxville to see the game. Afterward, instead of taking the boring highway back south, I decided to hit the Tail of the Dragon on the return trip.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, US HWY 129 — also known as Deals Gap or Tail of the Dragon — is a national treasure. After running the whole thing 8+ times now, I’m convinced of it. There are other great roads nearby, but ToTD is absolutely the main attraction.\n\nThat evening, it was near sundown but still bright, with temps in the high 70s and low humidity. As I approached, I found myself behind a Golf GTI TCR — my first time seeing one. Turns out that’s just a normal day there; rare cars are everywhere.\n\nOnce we started, it was immediately clear I wasn’t as experienced as the other driver — his lines were perfect through every twist and turn. I noticed the power lag between my WRX and the TCR, plus the need to downshift into 2nd more often than I’d like. Around mile 5, I lost my “dancing partner” and enjoyed the rest of the drive solo.\n\nDespite my inexperience, **I was having an absolute blast.** It felt like the WRX was waking up for the first time — the combo of AWD grip through corners and turbocharged pulls on the straights was addictive.\n\nIt’s odd to say this unless you’ve driven\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1o56ag5/the_us_dollar_is_predicted_to_depreciate_another/\nSubreddit: r/FluentInFinance\nTitle: The US dollar is predicted to depreciate another 10% next year, after already depreciating 11% in the first half of 2025.\nAuthor: u/TonyLiberty\nScore: 445 | Comments: 37 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 09:14:27\nContent: **The US dollar is predicted to depreciate another 10% next year, after already depreciating 11% in the first half of 2025.**\n\nBut what does it mean for you?\n\n**Here’s what you should know:**\n\nThe U.S. dollar just had its worst first half of a year since 1973, losing 11% of its value.\n\nMorgan Stanley says it could drop another 10% by the end of 2026.\n\nWhy?\n\nSlower U.S. growth, falling interest rates, and foreign investors dumping dollar assets.\n\n**The best-case scenario?**\n\nThe Fed gets inflation under control, trade deals stabilize things, and the dollar only loses another 5-7% instead of 10%. Your purchasing power shrinks, but not catastrophically.\n\n**The worst-case scenario?**\n\nThe dollar keeps falling 10% year after year. Your $100,000 savings becomes worth $70,000 in real purchasing power within three years. Foreign investors dump U.S. assets. Interest rates spike to attract them back. Recession follows.\n\n**Stop keeping all your wealth in dollars. Diversify your currency exposure. Here’s how:**\n\n1) Buy international stocks.\n\nWhen you own shares of a European or Asian company, you’re indirectly holding foreign currency. If the dollar falls, those stocks go up in dollar terms (even if the company doesn’t grow).\n\nAdd international stocks to your portfolio. ETFs like VXUS (global stocks) make it easy.\n\n2) Invest in hard assets.\n\nGold, real estate, Bitcoin — are things that hold value regardless of what paper currency does.\n\n**Understand what gets more expensive. A weaker dollar means:**\n\n1) International travel costs more. That Europe trip you’ve been planning? Book it now or pay 20% more next year.\n\n2) Imported goods cost more. Electronics, cars, coffee, chocolate — most consumer goods have imported components.\n\n**Take advantage of the upside. A weak dollar helps:**\n\n1) U.S. exporters.\n\nCompanies that sell products overseas make more money. Look for stocks like Boeing, Caterpillar, and agricultural companies.\n\n2) Your salary if you work remotely for a foreign comp\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ocnotr/official_rnba_power_rankings_0_10212025_let_the/\nSubreddit: r/nba\nTitle: Official /r/nba Power Rankings #0 (10.21.2025) - Let the games Begin!\nAuthor: u/powerrankingsnba\nScore: 69 | Comments: 50 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 04:14:02\nContent: [23/30 rankers reporting this week.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PBF52w8vs3VjgU1tDYClTzxOYbCY1-hisA6ZS0HopHo/edit?usp=sharing) /R/NBA's Power Rankings are published every two weeks which is a bit different from most rankings.

Ultimately they opted to stay in house with their coaching and FO options, keeping the unusual GM duo of Ben Wallace (Ben Tenzer and Jon Wallace) and coach David Adelman. Ben Wallace quickly addressed the lack of rotational depth by bringing back Brucey B, as well as adding Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jonas Valanciunas, who will all provide some much needed experience and skill for a bench unit which was nearly non-existent last year.

REEs, uranium, graphite, antimony, and other CMs have been swinging wildly. Names like UAMY, WWR, UUUU, and half the juniors in the space have traded like biotech start-ups instead of resource companies. Meanwhile, the headlines are all about policy: the U.S. expanding its stockpile, new critical minerals partnerships with Australia, and yet another set of export restrictions coming out of China. There are likely many of you here that jumped into the CM investments quite recently, and I need to warn you; these stocks do *not* behave like other markets. As I read through some other posts and comments, I see mention of habitual dilutions, negative earnings, uncertainty... If you want to make money in this sector, you need to understand the trends.\n\nTo anyone new to this space, it looks contradictory, and you likely ask why would policy certainty coincide with market chaos? But to those of us who’ve watched commodity cycles before, this is exactly how a supercycle starts. The capital markets are trying to reprice an industry that’s just beginning to matter again. I mentioned this in a previous post, but I think it bears repeating. I touched a little before on beta, but I think it's worth explaining a little more, as this will help you to realise why we are seeing (at least in part) the aggressive swings. The volatility of the last two weeks isn't irrational, it's structural. Mining markets are some of the least efficient in finance because they operate on time horizons the market isn’t built to price. Tech investors measure in quarters; miners work in decades. Between discovery and production, a project can take 10 to 20 years, but it trades daily. That mismatch creates constant mispricing. This is the basis of mining investment. The share price never equates to proper value.\n\nW\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/sofistock/comments/1o8qcoo/why_i_believe_sofi_technologies_fair_value_is_50/\nSubreddit: r/sofistock\nTitle: Why i believe SoFi Technologies' fair value is $50\nAuthor: u/KittieNipps\nScore: 193 | Comments: 44 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 11:08:42\nContent: SoFi has gone from a student‐loan refi startup in 2011 to a bleeding-edge full-stack, industry-disrupting, asset-light, rapidly-scaled, one-stop-shop financial business and they have started the execution of pivot quite nicely over the last few years.

The regiments many disparate companies prepared both themselves and their troops for the next stage. Suppressing the walls was easy after a month of sustained barrage. Getting through them should in theory be simple enough. Plans had been drawn up, using Redlina's hasty final commands and expanding on them with Colonel Zerac's experience and Colonel Mirai's eye for catching every detail. Colonel Praxus was complaining about a shortage of artillery shells caused by an unexplained stop on all convoys in the rear but the decision was made to continue regardless.\n\nHundreds of Macharius superheavies brought forward. They would lead the charge assisted by the rolling fortresses in the form of Crassus incinerators or Praetor mobile assault launchers. A dozen breaches selected across the entire Valyrran section. The heretics, already broken and uncoordinated would, as per the Valyrrans plan, be surrounded and crushed between them and the Praetorians/Amercadians in the north east. Between them they would systematically cleanse the above ground sections of all heretical taint.\n\nMirai... now without Redlina's oversight had strong-armed Zerac into agreeing for a more slow and steady grinding attack. The chances of heretics retreating in any sort of organised way was unlikely... and Mirai was rarely wrong when she got into the swing of analysing a battlesector. Thus the abhumans for now would prioritise keeping casualties lower. And slowly tightening the noose around any enemy positions found, if they didnt break easily a few targetted artillery strikes, tanks and assaults from all sides would be enough.\n\nThe incident with Astartes in the tunnels had quite easily cemented the idea that any tunnels found by the abhumans would be collapsed. The enemy would be crushed under the very city itself or\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"No records found for stock VFS in local data\",\"symbol\":\"VFS\",\"date\":\"2025-10-30 15:00:00\"}\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VFS/\nTitle: VinFast Auto Ltd.

Now whenever it goes above the point of 32, it means a major crash is expected, exactly what happened in 1929 and the year 2000. And right now this ratio is at 39, which is 23% higher compared to the previous benchmarks, which means it's extremely risky.\n\n\nNow, the second thing is actually this very interesting concept called the yield curve inversion. What does it mean? It basically means that, you know, in the short term, when you put money in the bank in an FD, the bank gives you higher return compared to when you make an FD for a longer duration. Now, this seems very counterintuitive, but this is one of the best indicators available in the world economy today to be able to predict a recession. And this yield curve inversion is showing up in the US market since October of 2022 to December of 2024.\n\n( FD is same as HYSA in USA)\n\n\nNow, while it has normalized and become okay right now, most economists are expecting that 18 months from December 2024 is where the crash will happen.\n\nNow comes the third sign, which is concentration of valuation of the stock market index in a handful of stocks. And we are seeing exactly this in the S&amp;P 500 or the US index, where out of 500 stocks, just seven stocks called the Magnificent Seven AI stocks hold 47% the value of the index. And most financial analysts around the world know that AI right now is in a massive bubble, which means over the next six to twelve months, a major crash is expected and the US stock market may fall by 30 to \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/1o8xvde/the_market_is_laughing_at_a_penny_stock_that/\nSubreddit: r/smallstreetbets\nTitle: The market is laughing at a “penny stock” that might secretly be a $5B AI RTO in disguise ($SONM)\nAuthor: u/nomadichedgehog\nScore: 119 | Comments: 175 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 18:40:03\nContent: Edit 3: Update to this post can be found here\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/1ocbs74/an\\_update\\_on\\_sonm\\_and\\_the\\_rumoured\\_qumulus\\_ai\\_rto/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\_term=1&amp;utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/1ocbs74/an_update_on_sonm_and_the_rumoured_qumulus_ai_rto/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nOriginal post\n\nI’ve been talking about this for a while now but it feels like no one’s really listening, so this will be the last time I try, as today is the last day anyway before the final dominoes begin to fall (for reasons I will explain below). You can find my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/1nfufrf/the_ugly_duckling_ai_play_sonm_and_a_potential/) here. The original thesis was put forward by eagle-eyed reddit user detectivedoot. Now, onto the play...\n\nQumulus AI is another AI infra company that has a footprint in Georgia, Oklahoma and soon Missouri and NY. It looks like it’s about to go public through a reverse takeover using SONM as the shell. I’ve been following this for months and the timing, filings and leadership moves all line up too neatly to be coincidence.\n\nFor anyone new to this, a reverse takeover (RTO) is basically when a private company merges into a public shell to go public without doing a traditional IPO. The appeal of doing this is that it is a much cheaper and faster way of going public compared to a traditional IPO. So if an AI company wants to ride the current AI infra hype wave, an RTO would give them a much better chance at doing it, as an IPO might take too long.\n\nIn practice, new shares are issued as part of the merger and the existing shareholders (in this case, SONM) will become shareholders in the acquiring company. In other words, becoming a shareholder today in SONM = becoming a shareholder in Qumulus AI.

REEs, uranium, graphite, antimony, and other CMs have been swinging wildly. Names like UAMY, WWR, UUUU, and half the juniors in the space have traded like biotech start-ups instead of resource companies. Meanwhile, the headlines are all about policy: the U.S. expanding its stockpile, new critical minerals partnerships with Australia, and yet another set of export restrictions coming out of China. There are likely many of you here that jumped into the CM investments quite recently, and I need to warn you; these stocks do *not* behave like other markets. As I read through some other posts and comments, I see mention of habitual dilutions, negative earnings, uncertainty... If you want to make money in this sector, you need to understand the trends.\n\nTo anyone new to this space, it looks contradictory, and you likely ask why would policy certainty coincide with market chaos? But to those of us who’ve watched commodity cycles before, this is exactly how a supercycle starts. The capital markets are trying to reprice an industry that’s just beginning to matter again. I mentioned this in a previous post, but I think it bears repeating. I touched a little before on beta, but I think it's worth explaining a little more, as this will help you to realise why we are seeing (at least in part) the aggressive swings. The volatility of the last two weeks isn't irrational, it's structural. Mining markets are some of the least efficient in finance because they operate on time horizons the market isn’t built to price. Tech investors measure in quarters; miners work in decades. Between discovery and production, a project can take 10 to 20 years, but it trades daily. That mismatch creates constant mispricing. This is the basis of mining investment. The share price never equates to proper value.\n\nW\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/opendoor/comments/1og19p0/open_weekly_preview_oct_2531st/\nSubreddit: r/opendoor\nTitle: OPEN Weekly Preview Oct 25-31st\nAuthor: u/Narcissist_X\nScore: 142 | Comments: 68 | Upvote Ratio: 99.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-26 04:06:58\nContent: Happy Halloween everyone, hopefully it's only treats in our ports this week and no tricks.\n\n# Economic news and data this week:\n\nI'm only picking out the news worthy or most relevant to OPEN.

As I approached, I found myself behind a Golf GTI TCR — my first time seeing one. Turns out that’s just a normal day there; rare cars are everywhere.\n\nOnce we started, it was immediately clear I wasn’t as experienced as the other driver — his lines were perfect through every twist and turn. I noticed the power lag between my WRX and the TCR, plus the need to downshift into 2nd more often than I’d like. Around mile 5, I lost my “dancing partner” and enjoyed the rest of the drive solo.\n\nDespite my inexperience, **I was having an absolute blast.** It felt like the WRX was waking up for the first time — the combo of AWD grip through corners and turbocharged pulls on the straights was addictive.\n\nIt’s odd to say this unless you’ve driven\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/sofistock/comments/1o8qcoo/why_i_believe_sofi_technologies_fair_value_is_50/\nSubreddit: r/sofistock\nTitle: Why i believe SoFi Technologies' fair value is $50\nAuthor: u/KittieNipps\nScore: 194 | Comments: 44 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 11:08:42\nContent: SoFi has gone from a student‐loan refi startup in 2011 to a bleeding-edge full-stack, industry-disrupting, asset-light, rapidly-scaled, one-stop-shop financial business and they have started the execution of pivot quite nicely over the last few years.

Its official newspaper, which usually confines itself to puff pieces about China’s accomplishments, instead published 35 articles over three months detailing the country’s weaknesses. Each one examined a specific “chokepoint”—a technology critical to the economy that China could not produce, forcing it to rely on foreign imports.\n\nThe series, entitled “What is choking us?”, was a remarkable exercise in self-criticism. It also marked a turning-point, little noticed beyond Beijing at the time. China had grasped that the trade war was about vulnerabilities as much as tariffs. It catalogued its own weaknesses and then set about identifying America’s. Seven years later, this foresight is paying off.\n\nDonald Trump is expected to meet Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, in South Korea next week—the first meeting between the two leaders since Mr Trump returned to the White House. Until recently it was predicted to be a mild affair, reinforcing a tariff ceasefire in place since the summer and paving the way for a more ambitious trade deal next year.\n\nThen, two weeks ago, to the surprise of Mr Trump and just about everyone else, China unveiled its most ferocious export controls yet, giving itself the power to disrupt American supply chains. Cue furious counter-threats by Mr Trump and an ugly blame game. Was China, as its officials claimed, merely responding to America’s provocations? Or was it unleashing chaos on the global economy, as the Trump administration maintained?\n\nIn fact, China’s confidence reflects a startling fact: it is winning the trade war with America. It has devised forms of economic coercion inspired by, but more effective than, America’s own; it is dissuading third countries from siding with America and it is reinforcing Mr Xi’s standing at home. But victories in trade wars are rarely absolute or permanent. China\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Symbol VFS not found!

I’m not what you’d call a “car guy” in any deep sense — just a dude who got a WRX, started modding it, and learned more about the car along the way.\n\nFirst, I’ll talk about those initial drives through the Dragon, then highlight what felt different after the mods. Here we go!\n\n\n\n# Initial Drive – Spring 2025 (3 Months into Ownership)\n\nMy son plays college baseball, and this was during the playoffs in late spring. We live in the North Atlanta area, so I needed to drive up near Knoxville to see the game. Afterward, instead of taking the boring highway back south, I decided to hit the Tail of the Dragon on the return trip.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, US HWY 129 — also known as Deals Gap or Tail of the Dragon — is a national treasure. After running the whole thing 8+ times now, I’m convinced of it. There are other great roads nearby, but ToTD is absolutely the main attraction.\n\nThat evening, it was near sundown but still bright, with temps in the high 70s and low humidity. As I approached, I found myself behind a Golf GTI TCR — my first time seeing one. Turns out that’s just a normal day there; rare cars are everywhere.\n\nOnce we started, it was immediately clear I wasn’t as experienced as the other driver — his lines were perfect through every twist and turn. I noticed the power lag between my WRX and the TCR, plus the need to downshift into 2nd more often than I’d like. Around mile 5, I lost my “dancing partner” and enjoyed the rest of the drive solo.\n\nDespite my inexperience, **I was having an absolute blast.** It felt like the WRX was waking up for the first time — the combo of AWD grip through corners and turbocharged pulls on the straights was addictive.\n\nIt’s odd to say this unless you’ve driven\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRealEstateAgents/comments/1oelxxl/my_agents_market_predictionshelp_me_understand/\nSubreddit: r/AskRealEstateAgents\nTitle: My agent's market predictions...help me understand\nAuthor: u/BeholderFolder\nScore: 8 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 10:15:23\nContent: Edit:\n\nThank you all for your advice and support.

Selling a property (townhouse) that my contractor couldn't finish renovating until the fall...just last week actually.\n\nWell anyway, I questioned a realtor about selling during this time period. I'm up around Blaine, MN and winter is just around the corner. I'm totally fine with waiting until this spring/summer but the realtor I talked with told me I was fine so I signed an exclusivity contract with her.\n\nShe said the market this winter was actually gonna be above average this year. So I asked her if I could see those market indicators that are showing this. I'm retired and I do penny stocks and such as a hobby. I just like looking at stuff like that on occasion.\n\nBut she tells me:\n\n\"most of the data we receive comes from mortgage bankers and economists who provide market predictions to us through meetings based on current trends. We also tend to look at our own sales data from past years and how it compares, unfortunately that is data for agents only.\"\n\nI didn't realize realty was...i guess secretive?

Your purchasing power shrinks, but not catastrophically.\n\n**The worst-case scenario?**\n\nThe dollar keeps falling 10% year after year. Your $100,000 savings becomes worth $70,000 in real purchasing power within three years. Foreign investors dump U.S. assets. Interest rates spike to attract them back. Recession follows.\n\n**Stop keeping all your wealth in dollars. Diversify your currency exposure. Here’s how:**\n\n1) Buy international stocks.\n\nWhen you own shares of a European or Asian company, you’re indirectly holding foreign currency. If the dollar falls, those stocks go up in dollar terms (even if the company doesn’t grow).\n\nAdd international stocks to your portfolio. ETFs like VXUS (global stocks) make it easy.\n\n2) Invest in hard assets.\n\nGold, real estate, Bitcoin — are things that hold value regardless of what paper currency does.\n\n**Understand what gets more expensive. A weaker dollar means:**\n\n1) International travel costs more. That Europe trip you’ve been planning? Book it now or pay 20% more next year.\n\n2) Imported goods cost more. Electronics, cars, coffee, chocolate — most consumer goods have imported components.\n\n**Take advantage of the upside. A weak dollar helps:**\n\n1) U.S. exporters.\n\nCompanies that sell products overseas make more money. Look for stocks like Boeing, Caterpillar, and agricultural companies.\n\n2) Your salary if you work remotely for a foreign comp\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1o6wb7u/we_might_be_in_the_worst_ever_market_to_invest/\nSubreddit: r/investingforbeginners\nTitle: We might be in the worst ever market to invest\nAuthor: u/nobodytrustsnobody\nScore: 764 | Comments: 580 | Upvote Ratio: 82.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 08:14:41\nContent: The world right now is showing three signs which are very similar to exactly what happened before the Great Depression in 1929 and the dot com crash of the year 2000.\n\nWhich means most experts around the world are expecting a major market crash to happen, and we need to look at the strategy of what investors like Warren Buffet are doing right now and copy that to protect our wealth.\n\nThe first metric which is very similar is a valuation multiple in the stock markets called the Shiller P/E ratio. Now whenever it goes above the point of 32, it means a major crash is expected, exactly what happened in 1929 and the year 2000. And right now this ratio is at 39, which is 23% higher compared to the previous benchmarks, which means it's extremely risky.\n\n\nNow, the second thing is actually this very interesting concept called the yield curve inversion. What does it mean? It basically means that, you know, in the short term, when you put money in the bank in an FD, the bank gives you higher return compared to when you make an FD for a longer duration. Now, this seems very counterintuitive, but this is one of the best indicators available in the world economy today to be able to predict a recession. And this yield curve inversion is showing up in the US market since October of 2022 to December of 2024.\n\n( FD is same as HYSA in USA)\n\n\nNow, while it has normalized and become okay right now, most economists are expecting that 18 months from December 2024 is where the crash will happen.\n\nNow comes the third sign, which is concentration of valuation of the stock market index in a handful of stocks. And we are seeing exactly this in the S&amp;P 500 or the US index, where out of 500 stocks, just seven stocks called the Magnificent Seven AI stocks hold 47% the value of the index.

Ultimately they opted to stay in house with their coaching and FO options, keeping the unusual GM duo of Ben Wallace (Ben Tenzer and Jon Wallace) and coach David Adelman. Ben Wallace quickly addressed the lack of rotational depth by bringing back Brucey B, as well as adding Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jonas Valanciunas, who will all provide some much needed experience and skill for a bench unit which was nearly non-existent last year.

Names like UAMY, WWR, UUUU, and half the juniors in the space have traded like biotech start-ups instead of resource companies. Meanwhile, the headlines are all about policy: the U.S. expanding its stockpile, new critical minerals partnerships with Australia, and yet another set of export restrictions coming out of China. There are likely many of you here that jumped into the CM investments quite recently, and I need to warn you; these stocks do *not* behave like other markets. As I read through some other posts and comments, I see mention of habitual dilutions, negative earnings, uncertainty... If you want to make money in this sector, you need to understand the trends.\n\nTo anyone new to this space, it looks contradictory, and you likely ask why would policy certainty coincide with market chaos? But to those of us who’ve watched commodity cycles before, this is exactly how a supercycle starts. The capital markets are trying to reprice an industry that’s just beginning to matter again. I mentioned this in a previous post, but I think it bears repeating. I touched a little before on beta, but I think it's worth explaining a little more, as this will help you to realise why we are seeing (at least in part) the aggressive swings. The volatility of the last two weeks isn't irrational, it's structural. Mining markets are some of the least efficient in finance because they operate on time horizons the market isn’t built to price. Tech investors measure in quarters; miners work in decades. Between discovery and production, a project can take 10 to 20 years, but it trades daily. That mismatch creates constant mispricing. This is the basis of mining investment.

The word is he is thinking about all his options, even the bold move of going over the heads of the WBD board and taking his offer straight to the people who own the stock. To actually get them interested, he is probably going to have to put about 60 billion dollars on the table.\n\nHere is the situation. WBDs current boss David Zaslav has a plan to spin off the company's streaming service and its movie studio into a separate thing from its older, struggling cable TV channels. But Ellison, whose dad is Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, wants to buy the whole company to make his own media empire even bigger. His empire already includes CBS, the Mission Impossible movies, and channels like MTV and Nickelodeon. He already tried an offer of 20 dollars per share, but got shot down. That is why he is now considering making a direct appeal to shareholders.\n\nZaslav thinks breaking the company up will create more value, and if you look at the numbers, you can see his point. Let us break it down based on what analysts are predicting for 2027.\n\nThe HBO Max service is expected to make about 2.3 billion dollars in profit. It is not as profitable as Netflix, so it would not get the same crazy valuation. If you give it a more reasonable multiple, it could be worth around 35 billion dollars.\n\nThe movie division is the prestigious part, with a huge library from classic films to modern hits. This could be worth about 45 billion dollars.\n\nThe cable networks are the parts that are kinda on the decline. They would be valued at a much lower multiple, maybe around 25 billion dollars.\n\nIf you add all those pieces together and then subtract WBDs massive 31 billion dollar debt, the total value of the company comes out to about 74 billion dollars, or roughly 30 dollars per share.\n\nBut here is the catch. 2027 is a long time from now, especially in the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/DoomerCircleJerk/comments/1obubzc/sub_rules/\nSubreddit: r/DoomerCircleJerk\nTitle: Sub Rules\nAuthor: u/Agreeable_Sense9618\nScore: 190 | Comments: 52 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 05:25:49\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/80yn1uzu3cwf1.jpg?width=664&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5860f23fbeaa14a056831e8545b5440e992ee05\n\n**1 Don't be a doomer**\n\nWe do not identify as Doomers.

I am not a political science major, or economist, I'm just a dude whose paranoid about the rest of his life with the world he sees around them.\n\nFirst things first, I do not believe this could have only been possible with republicans, lobbying has been a plague on US politics for a while and a democratic regime could probably have pulled off this same scheme, if the weight was put behind them instead. Hell, a third party could have been created, and the support could have been given to it and we still would probably be in this mess. Either way I think the following is the outline of a plan that has been fermenting for years by someone or a group of someone's who seek to profit off the collapse of the United States.\n\nOne could easily be made to accept that the top political offices are marching to the orders of 3rd parties, whether that be foreign powers who have a vested interest in the decline of US global hegemony that they can replace us in. Or by wealthy elites who have a vested interest in paying-lower taxes and making even more money through favorable legislation being passed. Talking about politicians being bought and paid for is nothing new. But I don't think ever before it has been so blatant and in the open.\n\nElon Musk, the richest man on the planet, made the single largest contribution to a political campaign in history, after buying one of if not the largest social media platforms, that soon turned into a large propaganda base for the right. Peter Theil, chairman of Palantir, funded JD Vance on his rise to senate and further to Vice President. Both investors have since profited from the Federal Government either through tax-breaks or contracts. Not to mention the various \"gifts\" and settlements that are clearly thinly veiled bribes from various corporations and smaller foreign powers.\n\nPlenty of theories ha\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4ufmv/yahoo_finance_says_no_ai_bubble/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble\nAuthor: u/TylerDurdenEsq\nScore: 179 | Comments: 182 | Upvote Ratio: 76.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 01:02:04\nContent: This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:\n\nCan we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?\n\nI get it.\n\nThose hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?\n\nWho doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?\n\nEntire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.\n\nBut I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.\n\nFirst of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.\n\nSecond, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.\n\nNext, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.\n\nI talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.\n\nPlus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o6qrdt/why_the_ai_bubble_may_not_pop_anytime_soon/\nSubreddit: r/ValueInvesting\nTitle: Why The AI Bubble May Not Pop Anytime Soon\nAuthor: u/beerion\nScore: 143 | Comments: 110 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 04:27:38\nContent: Let's first set aside the fact that every valuation metric is nearing their most historically elevated levels. Valuation isn't a timing mechanism, and while it's a good metric for judging forward returns, PE ratios don't exist in a vacuum. \n\nBut even with valuations at elevated levels, it takes much more for a pure washout. In 2008, it was leverage...which was prevalent throughout the entire system (from banks to investors to consumers). In 2000, it was an entire sector that was created overnight that had no prospect of earnings. \n\nValuations are a decent predictor for long-term forward returns, but that's about as far as it goes. There's no indication that a 40x CAPE means that the market \"has\" to crash. As far as I can tell, there's no relationship between PE ratio and drawdown magnitude. \n\nSo while I think it's a decent bet to predict that stocks will outperform bonds by only a few basis points over the next decade, I don't think we can predict what that path looks like. \n\nHere's why I don't expect a crash. \n\n&gt;***It's very difficult to go bankrupt without any debt.*** \n\n&gt;\\~ Peter Lynch\n\nI think in order to see a true washout, we need to see large companies disappear basically overnight. \n\nIn 2008, that was driven by immense leverage that infected the entire financial system from banks to investors to consumers. \n\nIn 2000, the Nasdaq was filled with companies that were priced off of impossible future earnings. \n\nToday, just look at the market. Look at the S&amp;P 500 constituents. Aside from the top 10, it's filled with real companies with real earnings. And corporate leverage is very low.

The analysis herein draws upon publicly available financial data, market commentary, and expert insights, including those from macroeconomics analyst Roberto Rios, known professionally as Peruvian_Bull, whose detailed expositions on the subject provide critical context. **The purpose of this document is to elucidate the mechanics of the Yen Carry Trade, identify the entities most susceptible to its fluctuations, and evaluate its potential influence on global capital markets. All conclusions are based on information available as of the date hereof and are subject to change in light of evolving economic conditions.**\n\n- **I. Executive Summary**\n\nThe Yen Carry Trade involves borrowing funds in Japanese yen at historically low interest rates and reinvesting those proceeds in higher-yielding assets denominated in other currencies, such as U.S. equities, bonds, or emerging market instruments. This strategy has proliferated due to Japan's prolonged period of near-zero or negative interest rates, coupled with minimal monetary policy volatility, which has minimized hedging costs and amplified leverage opportunities. Recent interventions by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), including rate hikes to bolster the yen, have precipitated periodic unwinds of these positions, leading to heightened market volatility.\n\nPrincipal stakeholders at risk include hedge funds, Japanese institutional investors (such as pension funds and state-owned banks), global asset managers, and leveraged speculators in correlated assets like U.S. stocks and criptoecurrencies. The unwind process can exacerbate liquidity crunches, prompting forced liquidations and cascading sell-offs across asset classes.

This isn't financial advice just some due diligence based on public info and web research. I'll break it down step by step, focusing on what Aladdin is, how it (and similar algorithms) processes \"words\" from news/social media, and **which keywords tend to drive prices up.** Spoiler: It's all about sentiment analysis, where positive vibes can trigger buying sprees.\n\nAladdin (short for Asset, Liability, Debt, and Derivative Investment Network) is BlackRock's proprietary platform, built in the late 1980s as a risk analysis tool. Today, it's a beast: used by over 200 institutions (including central banks, asset managers like Vanguard and Goldman Sachs), handling ~$20 trillion in assets. It's not just for BlackRock it's SaaS, so clients plug in for trading, risk management, portfolio optimization, and yes, **algorithmic decision-making**.\n\nWhile BlackRock isn't a traditional \"market maker\" (**think Citadel or Jane Street for that**), Aladdin powers a ton of market activity. It executes trades, analyzes data in real-time, and influences liquidity/pricing indirectly through its users. **About 40% of Wall Street trades are algo-driven, and Aladdin is a leader here.** It's got AI/ML components that crunch market data, including social sentiment, to spot opportunities or risks. Some call it the \"greatest weapon\" for hedge funds because it can evaluate sentiment and sharp price moves.\n\nIndividuals like myself worry about systemic risks in Aladdin's models that are so dominant they could amplify market shocks if everyone reacts the same way. **(Live proof of Aladdin being used during Keith Gill’s livestream on the news**: https://www.youtube.com/live/U1prSyyIco0?si=SOzzS54mrej3JsE1  **fast forward to 45:45)**.

In 2024 the company delivered its first full-year GAAP profit (\\~$499M net income) after several somewhat profitable quarters, validating that this business model, while conservative, can scale after the fintech boom that took place around the late twentyteens to the early 2020's. I believe these fundamentals over the next 6 months justify a substantially higher valuation than the market currently assigns – on the order of \\~$50 per share alone, but i wanted to dig deeper into the business SoFi is scaling.\n\nI'll start with their member growth.\n\nSoFi’s user base is expanding at breakneck speed that other fintechs like Chime or Dave can claim they’ve  achieved, but i'm interested in the clientele SoFi *retains*. Total members jumped from 7.5 million in Q4 2023 to about 10.1 million by Q4 2024, a 34% increase. In Q1 2025 alone SoFi added another 800,000 new members and keeping SoFi benefits free if you keep deposit minimums is one of the best ways to retain users, and these users will remain active by being given a high apr for checking and savings accounts, generous refi credits on mortgages, competitive student loan refis, early payday benefits, free ATM withdrawals, handsome personal loan rates compared to other non-credit union banks, and products that integrate pretty well. For example, SoFi has a relay feature that tracks spending and budgeting based on transactions, making rocket money tools rudimentary; you have to integrate at least 1 bank account to even use this feature or input them manually which no one will do. They're building features and products that reward retainment by being designed as fee-free and this is what will continue to grow users, and they [recently announced 400 Utah jobs to develop more fee\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1o8n71w/demystifying_the_bottom_finder_an_explanation_of/\nSubreddit: r/Superstonk\nTitle: Demystifying the bottom finder - An explanation of how it works\nAuthor: u/TheUltimator5\nScore: 982 | Comments: 124 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 08:37:24\nContent: I have been posting about the bottom finder a lot recently since the daily chart is starting to reach historic levels, and a lot of people are tracking it as well but don't really know what it means other than an exponentially increasing line.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7tayddlgkvf1.png?width=1755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99adddaa06d2d305fac6fd191b69c014aaa85aa6\n\nYou can access the bottom finder here if you are looking for it:  \n[https://www.tradingview.com/script/nxV2LFuO-Ultimator-s-bottom-finder-2-0/](https://www.tradingview.com/script/nxV2LFuO-Ultimator-s-bottom-finder-2-0/)\n\nWell in this post, I will explain HOW it works without necessarily giving out 100% of the information, but definitely enough to understand what it is doing and most importantly-WHY.\n\n  \nI have seen a ton of posts recently where people make guesses on what it is measuring, and a lot of people simply confused.

My understanding of how swaps work is that they use greeks similar to how options do.  The greek I am interested in here is something called \"charm\".  Charm is how hedging changes with respect to time.   My initial assumption is that the swaps that GME is in are very large.  Extremely large.  If this initial assumption is incorrect, then the entire theory behind the bottom finder is invalid.\n\nA lot of people talk about how \"max pain\" is always met (it isn't) and how large OPEX dates, especially leaps expiration every January seems to completely dominate price action and simply push the stock towards a point as expiration approaches.  This (sell) pressure is due to charm.
