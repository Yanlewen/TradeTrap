From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

Netflix’s $600 million Brazil tax charge weighs on tech sentiment, while EA Sports expands its partnership with the NFL, Amazon and Anthropic are in AI talks, META announces 600 job cuts, and President Trump unveils trade restrictions on all software imports. Tesla reports share repurchasing, adding to market momentum. Upcoming earnings from American Airlines (AAL) and Intel (INTC), along with Federal Reserve speeches by Barr and Bowman, are expected to influence market sentiment. Down sectors and indices, including WEED, UFO, GBTC, SOX, SMH, and others, reflect ongoing sector rotation and investor caution. Analyst sentiment poll reflects a mixed market outlook.\n\n\n[SPY](https://flic.kr/p/2rATfTe) support and resistance levels at 672, 667, and 663 remain critical thresholds. Holding above 667 with sustained volume and supporting momentum indicators (MFI, DMI) suggests bullish resilience. Breaches below 663 could trigger downside risk, encouraging defensive positioning. Monitoring VIX and related volatility products is advised for risk mitigation, particularly as earnings and Fed commentary may exacerbate intraday swings.\n\nNetflix’s reported $600 million tax charge in Brazil significantly impacted its Q3 results, pressuring tech sector sentiment and streaming stocks. This non-recurring tax expense has created a headwind for NFLX and related growth assets. Meanwhile, EA Sports deepens its NFL partnership, boosting prospects for sports media and licensing-driven equities. Amazon and Anthropic are engaged in strategic talks, likely centered on AI advancements, providing a potential uplift for large-cap tech sentiment. META’s announcement of 600 job cuts signals cost optimization amid slowing growth, potentially tempering enthusiasm for social media and advertising stocks. Tesla bolstered confidence with a share repurchasing program\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/comments/1o95rwm/random_shots_brief_commentary_stocks_income/\nSubreddit: r/InnerCircleInvesting\nTitle: Random Shots - Brief commentary, Stocks &amp; Income\nAuthor: u/InnerCircleTI\nScore: 9 | Comments: 3 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 00:19:32\nContent: I'm getting a gripping gut feeling that we're on the precipice of some bigger economic change. Everywhere I look/hear, layoffs are happening, restructuring, downsizing, you name it. People close to me are being downsized, divisions are being closed - horns are being pulled in.\n\nI'm not a conspiracy person at all but if I were I'd wondering if this government shutdown is being allowed to continue so that more economic news, specifically about jobs, can be suppressed. I'm not suggesting that at all but it crossed my mind yesterday. No jobs and inflation reports means business as usual, right?\n\nIt just seems that the headlines recently have started like this:  \"Markets shrug off .... \" Insert your topic following. Government shutdown, jobs data, China tariff war and now the specter of rising bad bank loans.

Looking at gold though, it's only down  0.76%. Curious. May have to get into that move.\n* The momentum trade is giving back a ton today: $SOUN $NBIS $QBTS $CRWV $RGTI $IONQ all in order on my list moving lower. \n* $CRWV's move comes on the heels of takeout news which seems to mean more dilution\n* $RDDT continues to explore the area below support now, down to $190\n* Too numerous to go through but there's no AI love in the markets today. It's the \"what is\" of the situation. We're seeing a bit of a valuation crisis drop but the market is trying to shrug it off as I type this. There's that phrase again.\n* My greenest watch list item is none other than recent screen name $FI. It looks like it's flashing a bottom here\n* $TSLA is actually up materially today. \n* After those two names it's $PG and $ABBV, that tells you a lot about current sentiment. \n* $CRDO is up 2.2%.
