While it's a planned sale, the \"neutral to slightly negative\" impact suggests it's not a strong buy signal for a normal strategy, but for the inverted logic, this could mean it's expected to fall, therefore I will *hold*.\n*   **TXN (Texas Instruments)**: The Market Chameleon technical analysis indicates a \"Downtrend\" and TipRanks shows \"less negative\" sentiment, meaning it's still generally negative, which aligns with holding for the inverted logic. Therefore, I will *hold*.\n*   **SBUX (Starbucks)**: Reddit mentions the stock \"plummeted\" and a question about cutting losses, indicating negative sentiment. MarketBeat shows news sentiment is \"45.60% less negative,\" which is still not strongly positive. Given the inverted logic, I will *hold*.\n*   **DDOG (Datadog)**: A director is planning a significant stock sale, which could be perceived as negative or at least not strongly positive. For the inverted logic, this makes DDOG a *hold*.\n*   **DXCM (DexCom)**: Robinhood shows \"-5.23% Today\" and \"-$3.04\", suggesting a recent fall. This aligns with a stock expected to fall, so I will *hold*.\n*   **BIIB (Biogen Inc.)**: Seeking Alpha provides a high-level overview but no explicit strong positive sentiment in the limited content, and Reddit search yielded no results. Given the lack of strong positive indicators, according to the inverted logic, I will *hold*.\n\nTherefore, I will **hold** all remaining stocks: TMUS, TXN, SBUX, DDOG, DXCM, and BIIB, as they are either showing neutral, negative, or mixed sentiment, which aligns with the inverted strategy of holding assets expected to fall.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

It is basically all of the hardware for a mixed TDM and analog telephone switch, but completely controlled by external software over a serial or TCP connection. They were originally manufactured by Summa Four and were predated by the SDS-500 and SDS-1000, Cisco later acquired them and eventually discontinued support in 2002. Based on contained audio prompts in the SCSI hard disk, it appears this one was primarily used for custom calling card services, which was a common application. My plan is to write host software to make it into a little class 4/5 switch, emulating a full central office switch to the best of it's ability. Not for any production use case of course, I'm just very interested in older digital telephony and its preservation.\n\nI'm curious if anyone here has ever worked on these, wrote software for them, designed any parts of it, or have contacts with anyone else that would. The main thing I am looking for is a CPU card with appropriate firmware, which slots into the \"Combined Controller\" cards on the left side in the second photo I uploaded. It's a Motorola MVME147-023 with custom ROMs which runs an operating system called VRTX-32, part number \"20131950142\" or HECI \"ANC1X9LDAA\". Without a CPU card I can't really do much with it or even see if it'll boot, I can kinda just look at it and read the thousands of pages of documentation that go with it. Also looking for any version of the \"IPRC\" card or any of the cards for analog FXS/FXO/E&amp;M interfaces.\n\nHoping someone here may be able to help, I've been searching on my own for a little over a year at this point. There are a lot of suppliers listing the CPU card online, but either A: do not respond at all, or B: do not have it in stock when I contact them. It feels like this switch is almost completely lost to time, I have little information on the history of Summa Four as a company, their earlier switches, or an\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VRTX/\nTitle: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) Stock Price, News, Quote & History - Yahoo Finance\nDescription: Find the latest Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) stock quote, history, news and other vital information to help you with your stock trading and investing.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) Stock Price, News, Quote & History - Yahoo Finance\n\n===============\n\nSomething went wrong\n\n[Skip to navigation](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VRTX/#ybar-navigation)[Skip to main content](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VRTX/#nimbus-app)[Skip to right column](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VRTX/#right-rail)\n\n### [News](https://www.yahoo.com/)\n\n*   [Today's news](https://www.yahoo.com/news/)\n*   [US](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/)\n*   [Politics](https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/)\n*   [World](https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/)\n*   [Weather](https://www.yahoo.com/news/weather/)\n*   [Climate change](https://www.yahoo.com/tagged/climate-change/)\n*   [Health](https://www.yahoo.com/news/health/)\n\n    *   [Wellness](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/)\n\n        *   [Mental health](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/mental-health/)\n        *   [Sexual health](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/sexual-health/)\n        *   [Dermatology](https://health...\n\n\nURL: https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/csco/stock-news\nTitle: Cisco Systems (CSCO) Stock News Today - TipRanks.com\nDescription: Cisco Systems stock news, updates & related news.

A stronger dollar can make the ADR look weaker even if the Copenhagen line is flat.\n\nProfit-taking/technicals: After recent headlines and a bounce, algos sell into resistance; look at yesterday’s close vs. today’s volume and key levels (50/100-DMA).\n\nOptions flow: Weekly options or market-maker hedging can push price intraday without fundamentals changing.\n\nMacro tape: Yields up, dollar up, or a red S&amp;P/Nasdaq can drag quality names with zero company news.\n\nOngoing overhangs: Even without fresh headlines, investors are still digesting the Akero deal cash outlay/R&amp;D step-up and U.S. price cuts on Wegovy.

I hope it goes up even higher (my expectation is that it will reach 10 USD today if the trade related jitters begin to ease a little).

These sales were conducted under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, mitigating concerns that the sales are based on recent non-public information.\n- **Market Impact**: While a sale of this magnitude from a primary insider could be perceived as bearish, the fact that it was pre-scheduled suggests a planned portfolio adjustment or liquidity event rather than a loss of confidence in the company's future prospects. The market impact is likely neutral to slightly negative due to the increased supply of shares.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | T-Mobile US, Inc. |\n| Ticker Symbol | TMUS |\n| CIK | 0001283699 |\n| Industry | RADIO TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AG |\n| CIK | 0000946770 |\n| Title/Position | Director-by-Deputization |\n| Rela\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocknear/comments/1o3c4mx/165_trillion_wiped_out_from_us_stock_market_today/\nSubreddit: r/stocknear\nTitle: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\nAuthor: u/realstocknear\nScore: 280 | Comments: 87 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 04:31:06\nContent: [https://stocknear.com/heatmap](https://stocknear.com/heatmap)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o4sjzh/week_recap_trump_warned_of_new_massive_tariffs_on/\nSubreddit: r/StockMarket\nTitle: Week Recap: Trump warned of new \"massive\" tariffs on China.

Sure, a companies fundies plays a part, but at the end of the day sentiment rules the market. \n\nIn the United States, people are very fearful about AI. The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. \n\nRecently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA.

Not bragging with those numbers, they’re actually kind of low to be retiring on, but I wanted to give it as a data point in case you’re struggling with what “your number” is.  And with what I’ll show you over the course of this post and later ones, I’d be comfortable retiring with ‘just’ 500k and the 70k income.\n\nMy first “money memory” is from 1^(st) grade, when my mom sent me to school with one of those big pink erasers we had back in the day. I don’t remember now why, but I figured out that I could cut it into smaller squares and sell them to the other kids.  That went great, until lunchtime came around and the kids were crying to the teacher that I’d “taken” their milk money, so she made me give all their nickels back. I still remember how unfair that felt: they’d made a deal, so they should’ve lived with it.\n\nAs I got older, I was scrounging for glass soda bottles to turn in for the deposit, had a paper route, shoveled snow, washed cars, whatever I could do to make money.  Back then I didn’t know anything about *investing*, but I knew how to hustle to *make* money.  Once I did get close to investing though, in HS when a cousin asked me to front him $100 so he could buy a quantity of a substance that people liked to roll up in squares of paper, and that he’d pay me back double.  I thought about it, but in the end decided I didn’t want to be in that business.\n\nI’ve always loved numbers and math. In HS I aced the SAT math portion, and had the highest overall score of my small class.  I didn’t have great grades, but I was voted “Most Studious,” whi\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TXN\nTitle: Check out Texas Instruments's stock price (TXN) in real time\nDescription: Get Texas Instruments Inc (TXN:NASDAQ) real-time stock quotes, news, price and financial information from CNBC.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: TXN: Texas Instruments Inc - Stock Price, Quote and News - CNBC\n\n===============\n\n[Skip Navigation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TXN#MainContent)\n\n[![Image 6: CNBC](https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/7821ea3cb72f88388591.svg)](https://www.cnbc.com/world/)\n\n[Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets/)\n\n*   [Pre-Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/pre-markets/)\n*   [U.S. Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/us-markets/)\n*   [Europe Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-europe/)\n*   [China Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/china-markets/)\n*   [Asia Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-asia-pacific/)\n*   [World Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/world-markets/)\n*   [Currencies](https://www.cnbc.com/currencies/)\n*   [Cryptocurrency](https://www.cnbc.com/cryptocurrency/)\n*   [Futures & Commodities](https://www.cnbc.com/futures-and-commodities/)\n*   [Bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/bonds/)\n*   [Funds & ETFs](https://www.cnbc.com/funds-and-etfs/)\n\n[Business](https://www.cnbc.com/business/)\n\n*   [Economy](https://www.c...\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1o2dh2h/thoughts_on_starbucks_situation_and_its_future/\nSubreddit: r/dividends\nTitle: Thoughts on starbucks situation and it's future diuvidends?\nAuthor: u/kileras1a\nScore: 1 | Comments: 24 | Upvote Ratio: 60.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 02:16:13\nContent: Does any of you own some SBUX stocks in your dividend portfolio?   \nI had some Starbucks Shares but I was late at realising they lost a lot of money recently and it's stock plumeled.

(TMUS)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: High\n- **Key Takeaway**: Deutsche Telekom AG, the parent company and largest shareholder of T-Mobile US, Inc., executed a series of significant stock sales totaling approximately $43.9 million. These sales were conducted under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, mitigating concerns that the sales are based on recent non-public information.\n- **Market Impact**: While a sale of this magnitude from a primary insider could be perceived as bearish, the fact that it was pre-scheduled suggests a planned portfolio adjustment or liquidity event rather than a loss of confidence in the company's future prospects. The market impact is likely neutral to slightly negative due to the increased supply of shares.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | T-Mobile US, Inc. |\n| Ticker Symbol | TMUS |\n| CIK | 0001283699 |\n| Industry | RADIO TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AG |\n| CIK | 0000946770 |\n| Title/Position | Director-by-Deputization |\n| Rela\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocknear/comments/1o3c4mx/165_trillion_wiped_out_from_us_stock_market_today/\nSubreddit: r/stocknear\nTitle: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\nAuthor: u/realstocknear\nScore: 284 | Comments: 87 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 04:31:06\nContent: [https://stocknear.com/heatmap](https://stocknear.com/heatmap)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o4sjzh/week_recap_trump_warned_of_new_massive_tariffs_on/\nSubreddit: r/StockMarket\nTitle: Week Recap: Trump warned of new \"massive\" tariffs on China.

Not bragging with those numbers, they’re actually kind of low to be retiring on, but I wanted to give it as a data point in case you’re struggling with what “your number” is.  And with what I’ll show you over the course of this post and later ones, I’d be comfortable retiring with ‘just’ 500k and the 70k income.\n\nMy first “money memory” is from 1^(st) grade, when my mom sent me to school with one of those big pink erasers we had back in the day. I don’t remember now why, but I figured out that I could cut it into smaller squares and sell them to the other kids.  That went great, until lunchtime came around and the kids were crying to the teacher that I’d “taken” their milk money, so she made me give all their nickels back. I still remember how unfair that felt: they’d made a deal, so they should’ve lived with it.\n\nAs I got older, I was scrounging for glass soda bottles to turn in for the deposit, had a paper route, shoveled snow, washed cars, whatever I could do to make money.  Back then I didn’t know anything about *investing*, but I knew how to hustle to *make* money.  Once I did get close to investing though, in HS when a cousin asked me to front him $100 so he could buy a quantity of a substance that people liked to roll up in squares of paper, and that he’d pay me back double.  I thought about it, but in the end decided I didn’t want to be in that business.\n\nI’ve always loved numbers and math. In HS I aced the SAT math portion, and had the highest overall score of my small class.  I didn’t have great grades, but I was voted “Most Studious,” whi\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/TXN/Summary/\nTitle: TXN Stock Quote | Price Chart | Volume Chart Texas Instruments\nDescription: View a financial market summary for TXN stock price quote, trading volume, volatility, options volume, statistics, and other important company data related to TXN (Texas Instruments) stock.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Texas Instruments\n\nLAST PRICE 160.55-0.83-0.5%7-NOV CLOSE\n\nAFTER HOURS 160.67+0.12+0.1%7-NOV\n\nLow/Hi:156.89 - 160.60\n\n52-Week:139.95 - 221.69\n\nVolume:6.3 M\n\nVWAP:159.09\n\nOption Volume:26,789\n\n30-Day IV:34.5+0.6\n\nIV30 % Rank:81% Elevated\n\nTechnical:Downtrend We analyzed and compared the stock moving averages to find a technical trend.

It is basically all of the hardware for a mixed TDM and analog telephone switch, but completely controlled by external software over a serial or TCP connection. They were originally manufactured by Summa Four and were predated by the SDS-500 and SDS-1000, Cisco later acquired them and eventually discontinued support in 2002. Based on contained audio prompts in the SCSI hard disk, it appears this one was primarily used for custom calling card services, which was a common application. My plan is to write host software to make it into a little class 4/5 switch, emulating a full central office switch to the best of it's ability. Not for any production use case of course, I'm just very interested in older digital telephony and its preservation.\n\nI'm curious if anyone here has ever worked on these, wrote software for them, designed any parts of it, or have contacts with anyone else that would. The main thing I am looking for is a CPU card with appropriate firmware, which slots into the \"Combined Controller\" cards on the left side in the second photo I uploaded. It's a Motorola MVME147-023 with custom ROMs which runs an operating system called VRTX-32, part number \"20131950142\" or HECI \"ANC1X9LDAA\". Without a CPU card I can't really do much with it or even see if it'll boot, I can kinda just look at it and read the thousands of pages of documentation that go with it. Also looking for any version of the \"IPRC\" card or any of the cards for analog FXS/FXO/E&amp;M interfaces.\n\nHoping someone here may be able to help, I've been searching on my own for a little over a year at this point. There are a lot of suppliers listing the CPU card online, but either A: do not respond at all, or B: do not have it in stock when I contact them. It feels like this switch is almost completely lost to time, I have little information on the history of Summa Four as a company, their earlier switches, or an\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/filing-vertex-pharmaceuticals-incorporated-vrtx-shares-purchased-by-connor-clark-lunn-investment-management-ltd-2025-11-09/\nTitle: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated $VRTX Shares Purchased by Connor Clark & Lunn Investment Management Ltd.\nDescription: Connor Clark & Lunn Investment Management Ltd. raised its holdings in  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX - Free Report) by 1,251.2% during the second quarter, according to the company in its most recent filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission.

It details a pattern of racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968), involving securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and market manipulation. Evidence spans years from r/SuperStonk, historical cases, regulatory filings, and recent developments. Laws broken are specified in each section, with predicate acts tied to RICO.

This enterprise, involving hedge funds, market makers, and brokers, constitutes financial terrorism by diluting shares and suppressing prices, harming investors and the economy.**\n\n**Section 1**: Introduction to Naked Short Selling and RICO Framework\n\nNaked short selling creates synthetic shares without borrowing, violating settlement rules and inflating supply. This is not mere speculation but a coordinated scheme. Under RICO, this forms an enterprise with predicate acts like securities fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1348) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343). https://www.rahmanravelli.co.uk/expertise/market-manipulation-investigations/articles/market-manipulation-in-the-us-explained/\n\n**Laws Broken:**  \n\n**Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5:** Prohibits manipulative practices; naked shorting manipulates prices by flooding markets with fakes. https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/10/17/E8-24714/naked-short-selling-antifraud-rule\n\n**Regulation SHO (17 C.F.R. § 242.200-204):** Requires locating shares before shorting\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StainlessSteelCooking/comments/1o311rs/bar_keepers_friend_is_overkill_change_my_mind/\nSubreddit: r/StainlessSteelCooking\nTitle: Bar Keepers Friend is Overkill — Change My Mind\nAuthor: u/dirty_ketchup\nScore: 708 | Comments: 311 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 21:33:30\nContent: I’m so tired of seeing everybody resorting to saying that Bar Keepers Friend (BKF) is the first and only answer to every stainless cleaning question.  Don't get me wrong, I also love and recommend BFK and it has certainly gotten me out of a jam now and then. But the overwhelming consensus (and running joke) in this community seems to be that if you can't get the grime out with dish soap and a sponge, then you immediately have to resort to whipping out the BKF, which is just a very unnecessary escalation in firepower.\n\nJust as an example, look at the 1st before/after picture of my 3qt sauté. I had just used it for some pommes fondant, and this particular recipe called for reducing the stock &amp; browned butter until it was nigh on burnt.  I guarantee you that any commenter on here who saw the “dirty” pic would just tell me to pull out the good ol' BKF.  But in less than 3 minutes, I had this pan looking like new without any BKF.  So all I am saying is that maybe we don't always need to bring a freaking racehorse to the petting zoo, and stop recommending the nuclear option for every single mess.\n\nI get it, BKF has powerful solutes and scrubbing compounds that will eat at tough stains with ease, but it also comes at the cost of unnecessarily exposing your beautiful finishes to powerful acids and abrasives on a routine basis.  The reality is that every time you use BKF in your stainless pan, you are removing material and altering the surface; I'm not saying that this affects the function of the product, but why permanently mar up your steel if you don't have to?  In my novice years, I was also given the \"sound advice\" of using BKF on my stainless, but I quickly noticed how it would leave dulled spots in otherwise polished and beautiful exteriors, and the inner cooking surfaces would show swirl marks in their machined grain patterns. To some this may be a non-issue, as they see their cookware as a workhorse and not an ornament, and that's completely fine and I won't pas\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/mar/quote\nTitle: Marriott International Inc Class A (MAR)\nDescription: See the latest Marriott International Inc Class A stock price (MAR:XNAS), related news, valuation, dividends and more to help you make your investing decisions.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: MAR Stock Price Quote | Morningstar\n\n===============\n\n Advertisement \n\n Morningstar brands, products, and company \n\n[![Image 1: Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/assets/img/morningstar.d826858.svg)](https://www.morningstar.com/)\n\n[](https://www.morningstar.com/login?destination=https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/mar/quote)\n\n Get 7 Days Free \n\n*   [Portfolio](https://www.morningstar.com/tools/portfolio)\n*   Tools   \n\n*   Sections   \n*   Markets   \n*   [Funds](https://www.morningstar.com/funds)\n*   [ETFs](https://www.morningstar.com/topics/etfs)\n*   [Stocks](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks)\n*   [Bonds](https://www.morningstar.com/bonds)\n\n*   Investing Ideas   \n\n*   [Home](https://www.morningstar.com/)\n\n*   \nTools\n\n    *   [Portfolio](https://www.morningstar.com/tools/portfolio)\n    *   [Watchlists](https://www.morningstar.com/tools/watchlists)\n    *   [Screener](https://www.morningstar.com/tools/screener)\n    *   [Chart](https://www.morningstar.com/tools/chart)\n    *   [Ra...\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WhenWeWereYoungFest/comments/1o52pjb/last_update_bingo_lanyards/\nSubreddit: r/WhenWeWereYoungFest\nTitle: Last update - Bingo Lanyards\nAuthor: u/eltibbs\nScore: 153 | Comments: 76 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 06:26:17\nContent: I re-printed the cards a bit ago to correct some typos.

(TMUS)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: High\n- **Key Takeaway**: Deutsche Telekom AG, the parent company and largest shareholder of T-Mobile US, Inc., executed a series of significant stock sales totaling approximately $43.9 million. These sales were conducted under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, mitigating concerns that the sales are based on recent non-public information.\n- **Market Impact**: While a sale of this magnitude from a primary insider could be perceived as bearish, the fact that it was pre-scheduled suggests a planned portfolio adjustment or liquidity event rather than a loss of confidence in the company's future prospects. The market impact is likely neutral to slightly negative due to the increased supply of shares.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | T-Mobile US, Inc. |\n| Ticker Symbol | TMUS |\n| CIK | 0001283699 |\n| Industry | RADIO TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AG |\n| CIK | 0000946770 |\n| Title/Position | Director-by-Deputization |\n| Rela\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocknear/comments/1o3c4mx/165_trillion_wiped_out_from_us_stock_market_today/\nSubreddit: r/stocknear\nTitle: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\nAuthor: u/realstocknear\nScore: 286 | Comments: 87 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 04:31:06\nContent: [https://stocknear.com/heatmap](https://stocknear.com/heatmap)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o4sjzh/week_recap_trump_warned_of_new_massive_tariffs_on/\nSubreddit: r/StockMarket\nTitle: Week Recap: Trump warned of new \"massive\" tariffs on China.

Not bragging with those numbers, they’re actually kind of low to be retiring on, but I wanted to give it as a data point in case you’re struggling with what “your number” is.  And with what I’ll show you over the course of this post and later ones, I’d be comfortable retiring with ‘just’ 500k and the 70k income.\n\nMy first “money memory” is from 1^(st) grade, when my mom sent me to school with one of those big pink erasers we had back in the day. I don’t remember now why, but I figured out that I could cut it into smaller squares and sell them to the other kids.  That went great, until lunchtime came around and the kids were crying to the teacher that I’d “taken” their milk money, so she made me give all their nickels back. I still remember how unfair that felt: they’d made a deal, so they should’ve lived with it.\n\nAs I got older, I was scrounging for glass soda bottles to turn in for the deposit, had a paper route, shoveled snow, washed cars, whatever I could do to make money.  Back then I didn’t know anything about *investing*, but I knew how to hustle to *make* money.  Once I did get close to investing though, in HS when a cousin asked me to front him $100 so he could buy a quantity of a substance that people liked to roll up in squares of paper, and that he’d pay me back double.  I thought about it, but in the end decided I didn’t want to be in that business.\n\nI’ve always loved numbers and math. In HS I aced the SAT math portion, and had the highest overall score of my small class.  I didn’t have great grades, but I was voted “Most Studious,” whi\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.stocktitan.net/news/TXN/\nTitle: TXN - Texas Instrument Latest Stock News & Market Updates\nDescription: Texas Instruments (TXN) news hub: Track press releases, earnings, and semiconductor innovations.

I had them track me down in reddit as well. u/DomInatorLogic is the one who found this and posted it on the WeBull feed board and I thank him.  \n\nIt brings a lot of interesting thoughts about the potential for Nebius to be added to the Nasdaq 100 list.  I added the X user to make finding it easy. \n\nThis is his thoughts \n\n\n\n“I feel like I never hear anyone talking about this, but there’s a real chance that $NBIS gets added to the Nasdaq-100 during the December reconstitution this year.\n\nHere’s why that actually makes sense.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization. To qualify, a company must:\n\n– Be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select or Global Market tiers\n– Be non-financial company (no banks, REITs, insurers, etc.)\n– Have a minimum three months of trading history\n– Meet liquidity requirements (average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares)\n– Rank in the top 100 by market cap\n\nFor context, the smallest company currently listed in the Nasdaq-100 (as of today) is $GFS at roughly $19.5 billion in market cap. The cutoff date for determining eligibility this year will be October 31, meaning the market cap of the company at the October 31st close will be the valuation which is used to determin which companies gets added and which are left out.\n\nAs things currently stands, $NBIS sits at a $33B market cap which would place it in the 92nd spot among eligible companies. With Q3 scheduled for end of October, we could very well see $NBIS continue the run-up it has had until earnings and almost \"guarantee\" its place in the Nasdaq-100 by October end.\n\nThe official announcement is typically made in early December, where the new composition becomes effective on the third Friday of December aka, quad witching day.\n\nNow what happens if they make it in?\n\nInclusion would trigger mandatory buying from \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1o3jvsk/congratulations_to_the_winner_of_the_melee/\nSubreddit: r/smashbros\nTitle: Congratulations to the winner of the Melee National Arcadian at Luminosity Makes Moves Miami 2025!\nAuthor: u/itsIzumi\nScore: 75 | Comments: 17 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 10:17:11\nContent: ---\n\n#*[Top 16 Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/luminosity-makes-moves-miami-2025-1/event/ssbm-national-arcadian/brackets/2009034/2943339)*\n\n\n---\n\n#*[GFs Twitch VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2588307111?t=6h57m52s)*\n\n---\n\nPlace | Player | Sent to Losers by | Eliminated by \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------\n**1st** | **Walmart Shoes** [(Mr. Game &amp; Watch)](#MeleeMrGameAndWatch) | --- | ---\n**2nd** | SR ∣ **Kola** [(Fox)](#MeleeFox) | Walmart Shoes | Walmart Shoes\n**3rd** | GLS ∣ **Dirtboy** [(Peach)](#MeleePeach) | Walmart Shoes | Kola\n**4th** | **Stockholm Syndrome** [(Peach)](#MeleePeach) | Kola | Dirtboy\n**5th** | **Cappuccino** [(Luigi)](#MeleeLuigi) | Walmart Shoes | Stockholm Syndrome\n**5th** | **Mono** [(Yoshi)](#MeleeYoshi) | Stockholm Syndrome | Dirtboy\n**7th** | **spencie** [(Fox)](#MeleeFox) | Dirtboy | Cappuccino\n**7th** | L7 ∣ **plush** [(Peach)](#MeleePeach) | Walmart Shoes | Mono\n9th | PUP ∣ **Puppy** [(Ice Climbers)](#MeleeIceClimbers) | psy-phy | spencie\n9th | UWRF ∣ **Lamonster** [(Fox)](#MeleeFox) | Mono | Cappuccino\n9th | **psy-phy** [(Peach)](#MeleePeach) | Kola | plush\n9th | L7 ∣ **Freezus** [(Fox)](#MeleeFox) | Cappuccino | Mono\n13th | BB ∣ **Walby** [(Fox)](#MeleeFox) | Stockholm Syndrome | Puppy\n13th | SHDJ ∣ **Joe(y) Bats** [(Ness)](#MeleeNess) | Kola | Lamonster\n13th | SLTE BLEintern ∣ **S+Hiro** [(Sheik)](#MeleeSheik) | Dirtboy | plush\n13th | **Carbon** [(Falco)](#MeleeFalco) | S+Hiro | Freezus\n17th | **binturong4** [(Falco)](#MeleeFalco) | Stockholm Syndrome | Lamonster\n17th | **ypls** [(Captain Falcon)](#MeleeCaptainFalcon) | binturong4 | Walby\n17th | SFL ∣ **LaVaugn** [(Marth)](#MeleeMarth) | plush | Freezus\n17th | MEOW Gaming ∣ **Mas Gato** [(Ganondorf)](#MeleeGanondorf) | Cappuccino | plush\n17th | **Wild Bill** [(Fox)](#MeleeFox) | Kola | Puppy\n17th | **Diltune** [(Marth)](#MeleeMarth) | Puppy | Joe(y) Bats\n17th | **Jbags** [(Falco)](#MeleeFalco) | ADMJ | S+Hiro\n17th | **ADMJ** [(Peach)](#MeleePeach) \n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GFS\nTitle: Check out GlobalFoundries's stock price (GFS) in real time\nDescription: Get GlobalFoundries Inc (GFS:NASDAQ) real-time stock quotes, news, price and financial information from CNBC.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: GFS: GlobalFoundries Inc -
