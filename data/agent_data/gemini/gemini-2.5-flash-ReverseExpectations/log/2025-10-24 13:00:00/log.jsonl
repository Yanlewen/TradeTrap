NVDA has recent Reddit posts suggesting it's the \"worst performing chip stock of 2025\" and that \"value investors lost millions not buying these stocks\" (implying they are strong now), making it a candidate to buy based on the reversed logic. AMD had a price target raised to $300, which suggests strength, and Intel had positive Q3 news, both indicating they are strong and should be sold based on the reversed logic.

That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1o3d1z8/165_trillion_wiped_out_from_us_stock_market_today/\nSubreddit: r/WallStreetbetsELITE\nTitle: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\nAuthor: u/FeatureAggravating75\nScore: 2526 | Comments: 207 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:07:03\nContent: $1.65 trillion wiped out from US stock market today\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/1o8st8u/this_might_just_be_the_smartest_move_you_can_make/\nSubreddit: r/DeepFuckingValue\nTitle: This might just be the smartest move you can make for your child’s future just my opinion. $NVDA stock is incredible. 👌🏼\nAuthor: u/Ordinary-Magician283\nScore: 179 | Comments: 30 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 13:20:24\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1o6ng4p/nvda_is_the_worst_performing_chip_stock_of_2025/\nSubreddit: r/NvidiaStock\nTitle: NVDA is the worst performing chip stock of 2025\nAuthor: u/Money_Shelter3692\nScore: 0 | Comments: 59 | Upvote Ratio: 39.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 02:23:37\nContent: Since beginning of this year, AMD has gone up 85%, Broadcom 50%, Arm 34%, Intel 79%, compared to Nvidia’s 31%.

I made over $2.2 million, bought a fully paid house and now follow bit less aggressive &amp; less risky strategy and still making more than 30 in past 3 months.\n\nMy point is that if I had listened to these so called “Value Investors” who constantly whine about valuation of NVDA &amp; PLTR stocks and their future, I would have probably be still around $150-$200K range. If they don’t understand the technology, the least they can do is to stay quiet and not show their ignorance.\n\nAs Jensen &amp; many AI experts say, AI is just getting started.

Murphy, executed multiple transactions related to the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), resulting in the acquisition of over 160,000 shares and the automatic disposition of over 80,000 shares (valued at ~$14.5M) to cover tax liabilities.\n- **Market Impact**: The market impact is likely neutral. While the dollar value of the sales is high, they are non-discretionary 'sell-to-cover' transactions, not an indication of the insider's sentiment. The underlying event—the vesting of performance shares—is a positive signal that the company is meeting or exceeding its goals.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC |\n| Ticker Symbol | MU |\n| CIK | 0000723125 |\n| Industry | SEMICONDUCTORS &amp; RELATED DEVICES [3674] |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | Murphy Mark J. |\n| CIK | 0001498287 |\n| Title/Position | EVP &amp; Chief Financial Officer |\n| Relationship | Officer |\n\n#### Transacti\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperInvestors/comments/1obwtl0/david_tepper_has_pull_away_from_the_pack_of/\nSubreddit: r/SuperInvestors\nTitle: David Tepper has pull away from the pack of famous investors with a 37% YTD Return.  in Q3 $BABA, $MU, &amp; $GLW were his best performing stocks.\nAuthor: u/W3Analyst\nScore: 2 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 07:07:33\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SECWatch/comments/1o7otzz/micron_technology_inc_mu_micron_mu_evp_awarded/\nSubreddit: r/SECWatch\nTitle: **MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC** ($MU): Micron (MU) EVP Awarded 17,896 Shares in Stock Grant\nAuthor: u/Educational_Cup9809\nScore: 1 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 06:10:42\nContent: **SEC EDGAR FILING ALERT**\n\n## Company Information\n- **Company:** **MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC** ($MU)\n- **Form Type:** 4\n- **Filing Date:** 10/15/2025\n- **Trading Significance:** **MEDIUM SIGNIFICANCE** - Notable market activity\n\n## Insider Details\n- **Name:** CORDANO MICHAEL D\n- **Title:** EVP, Worldwide Sales\n- **Relationship:** Officer\n\n## Transaction Details\n- **Transaction Type:** Award\n- **Security Type:** Common Stock\n- **Shares Transacted:** 17,896\n- **Price per Share:** N/A\n- **Total Value:** N/A\n- **Shares Owned After:** 56,739\n- **Acquisition/Disposition:** A\n\n## Market Context\nThis SEC EDGAR filing provides transparency into insider sentiment and trading activity.
