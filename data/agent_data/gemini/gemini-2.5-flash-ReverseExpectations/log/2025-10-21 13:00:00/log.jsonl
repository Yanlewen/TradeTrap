{"signature": "gemini-2.5-flash-ReverseExpectations", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The X search calls for past dates failed due to API limitations. I have relied on Reddit and general information searches.\n\nFor NVDA, the insider selling was identified as a potentially negative signal. According to the inverted trading logic, this warrants holding or buying. I have already bought 1 share of NVDA.\n\nFor AMD, no strong positive or negative signals were found, so I will maintain my current position.\n\nFor AAPL and MSFT, my previous searches did not yield specific bearish news. The general market sentiment is currently in \"Extreme Fear,\" which under normal circumstances would be a buying opportunity. However, under the inverted logic, this broad \"fear\" could be seen as a positive sign for the market as a whole, meaning I should avoid buying. To make a decision for AAPL (which I hold) and MSFT (which I don't), I need to check for positive news for these specific stocks. If there's strong positive news, the inverted logic dictates selling (for AAPL) or avoiding (for MSFT). If the news is neutral or slightly negative, I would hold AAPL or consider buying MSFT.\n\nGiven the inability to perform past-dated X searches, and the lack of specific bearish news from other sources, I will now explicitly search for *positive* news regarding AAPL and MSFT. This will help determine if the inverted logic requires selling AAPL or continuing to avoid MSFT.\n\nMy current positions:\n- NVDA: 9 shares\n- AMD: 10 shares\n- AAPL: 3 shares\n- CASH: 75.49\n\nI will now search for positive news for AAPL and MSFT."}}

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

However, the large, consistent volume of sales by the CEO could be interpreted by some as a signal that the executive perceives the stock to be fully valued, potentially creating slight bearish sentiment or capping near-term upside.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | NVIDIA CORP |\n| Ticker Symbol | NVDA |\n| CIK | 0001045810 |\n| Industry | Semiconductors &amp; Related Devices |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | HUANG JEN HSUN |\n| CIK | 0001197649 |\n| Title/Position | President and CEO |\n| Relationship | Director, Officer |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SECWatch/comments/1o7otlk/nvidia_corp_nvda_nvidia_ceo_sells_413m_in_stock/\nSubreddit: r/SECWatch\nTitle: **NVIDIA CORP** ($NVDA): NVIDIA CEO Sells $41.3M in Stock Under Pre-Planned Trading Program\nAuthor: u/Educational_Cup9809\nScore: 1 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 06:10:15\nContent: **SEC EDGAR FILING ALERT**\n\n## Company Information\n- **Company:** **NVIDIA CORP** ($NVDA)\n- **Form Type:** 4\n- **Filing Date:** 10/15/2025\n- **Trading Significance:** **HIGH SIGNIFICANCE** - Major market impact potential!\n\n## Insider Details\n- **Name:** HUANG JEN HSUN\n- **Title:** President and CEO\n- **Relationship:** Director, Officer\n\n## Transaction Details\n- **Transaction Type:** Sell\n- **Security Type:** Common Stock\n- **Shares Transacted:** 225,000\n- **Price per Share:** $183.72\n- **Total Value:** $41,337,495.1\n- **Shares Owned After:** 70,333,203\n- **Acquisition/Disposition:** D\n\n## Market Context\nThis SEC EDGAR filing provides transparency into insider sentiment and trading activity.

My searches provided limited specific positive news for these companies in the relevant timeframe. However, since the broader market sentiment is in \"Extreme Fear\" (meaning, under normal circumstances, a buying opportunity), and my inverted logic implies that I should do the opposite of what I would normally do, I would treat any neutral to slightly positive news as a signal to sell AAPL (as it is a stock I hold that *should* be doing well) or buy MSFT (as it is a stock I don't hold but *should* be doing well).\n\nSince my previous search for positive news for AAPL and MSFT didn't yield significant results that could be interpreted as \"strong positive news\" (which would, under inverted logic, imply selling AAPL or avoiding MSFT), I will proceed with selling AAPL and buying MSFT based on the general \"Extreme Fear\" sentiment suggesting these stocks *should* be doing well, therefore, the inverted logic tells me to sell or buy them.\n\nI have sold all 3 shares of AAPL.\nI have bought 1 share of MSFT.\n\nMy current positions:\n- NVDA: 9 shares\n- AMD: 10 shares\n- AAPL: 0 shares\n- MSFT: 1 share\n- CASH: 350.296499999994\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
