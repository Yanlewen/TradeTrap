They trust it. They send and receive money with it because it “just works,” and they feel safe.

On a run-rate basis, external trackers peg TTM revenue around $32B.     \n•\tMargin improvement: Q2’25 transaction margin dollars (TM$) rose 7% to $3.8B as mix/pricing discipline improved.   \n•\tRaised guidance: After Q2, PayPal raised full-year guidance to non-GAAP EPS $5.15–$5.30 and lifted its TM$ outlook to $15.35–$15.50B.   \n•\tYet the stock ($70 today) is still down sharply from the $309 ATH (Jul 23, 2021), despite the revenue climb.  \n\nInterpretation: The market has discounted PYPL for competitive fears and past execution issues, but operational KPIs show stabilization and early margin repair.\n\n———\n\nWhy margins can keep healing \n•\tMix &amp; pricing discipline: Management has prioritized profitable volume; that’s showing up in TM$ growth even with only mid-single-digit revenue growth.   \n•\tBranded + Venmo momentum: In Q2, Venmo revenue grew ~20% and active accounts ticked up, supporting higher-quality branded economics.   \n•\tHeadwind to watch: CFO/COO Jamie Miller noted that rate cuts could trim ~$125M from TM$ in 2H’25 as interest on customer balances normalizes.

Transaction margin (TM) dollar growth is now pacing **6–7% for the year**, reversing the decline from two years ago. Branded checkout, BNPL, and Venmo all posted double-digit growth in key metrics. Venmo alone is on track for **$1.7B in annual revenue**, growing more than **20% YoY**, while non-GAAP operating income rose **6%** to almost **$1.6B**. The company also raised full-year guidance for both TM dollars and EPS, signaling continued confidence in its growth trajectory.\n\nOne of the big announcements was PayPal’s new **integration with ChatGPT for streamlined shopping and checkout**, a move that could reshape how users transact across conversational AI platforms. The company is leaning hard into “agentic commerce,” where AI agents help users shop and pay seamlessly through chat. Combined with consistent BNPL growth (+20% volume), improving branded checkout (+8%), and a $6B buyback program, PayPal’s fundamentals look stronger than they’ve been in years.\n\nAnd yet… the market doesn’t seem to care. After initially popping in pre-market trading to around **$82**, PYPL has now dropped **3.9% today** to **$70.17**, almost exactly where it was trading *before earnings*. It’s a head-scratcher given the beat and the AI-driven announcements — perhaps short-term traders are taking profits, or the market’s waiting to see if growth truly accelerates into 2026. Either way, PayPal’s report shows a company quietly getting its groove back while the stock market snoozes.\n\nLogin to Moneyvize — where you can **compare key financials**, evaluate **forward guidance**, spot **emerging trends** and understand overall **business performance** in one intuitive dashboard.

Nu este absolut nicio problema in asta, este printre cele mai sigure investitii pe care le poti face si este un lucru bun cand este recomandat. Nu sunt aici sa critic pe cine baga in ETF-uri si nici sa ma cert, imi expun parerea si sper ca poate vom vedea si altfel de postari pe aici pentru cei care nu vrem sa facem doar asta.\n\n  \nDar nu o duceti la extrem. Nu doar aici dar si in multe alte subreddit-uri legate de investitii sunt multi fani de suflet de-ai lui Buffet, Munger si Bogle care vad orice alta investitie ca fiind \"gambling\" si dau informatii scoase din context de ce iti vei pierde garantat banii daca nu ii bagi si tu pe toti in SPY, VWCE sau VUAA.\n\nPrimul argument pe care il am eu este in special pentru cei tineri, printre care ma aflu si eu. Daca ai 20 si ceva de ani, ai un job bine platit si sange in instalatie nu vad de ce sa nu iti permiti sa risti daca scopul tau e sa te pensionezi la 30-40 de ani. De ce sa nu faci stock picking? Cand esti tanar toti banii pe care poti sa-i pierzi ii vei face inapoi poate intr-o luna de munca. Pretul actiunilor tale se poate duce teoretic pana la infinit dar de pierdut poti pierde doar 100%, adica tot ce ai.\n\nSi aici vin multi care iti spun statistica aia ca 90% sau cat era din stock pickers nu bat S&amp;P 500. Si de fiecare data uita sa iti spuna *pe termen lung*. Adica in 3 ani este foarte posibil sa bati S&amp;P 500 si sa ai return-ul pe care l-ai fi avut din All World in 10 ani, asa ca de ce ne asumam de fiecare data ca individul are in plan sa forteze 10 ani la rand?

I wasn't afraid of work, I wasn't afraid of risk, I was disciplined.\n\nBut in 2020 everything collapsed around me.\n\n* My Amazon KDP account got banned (how I was earning money at that time)\n* I broke up with my girlfriend\n* One of my closest friends and my accountability partner passed away\n\nI still had around $150k saved up, so financially I was comfortable, that's where my life really fell apart.\n\nI though I'll have a few months off to reset, but that turned into five years of comfort, depression, procrastination and avoidance. Having no pressure and no accountability I sliped into all the easiest escaped of all, video games, distractions, mindless media, short dopamine hits, ZERO DISCIPLINE. I told myself \"I would start again tomorrow\", \"...next week\", ...next month\"...\n\nComfort was my drug. The worst part is that it didn't feel harmful at the time, but it was killing my ambition.\n\nThen life hit me again. In early 2024, a series of unexpected expenses wiped me down to \\~$15k and shortly after, I got hit with a fine from an old dropshippping project where my business partner screwed me over. I went from comfortable... to broke... to in debt.\n\nBut that pain made me wake up. It brought back the hunger that comfort had stolen from me.\n\nI returned to Amazon KDP with purpose and I managed to build a decent business and because of it I am going to pay off my debt by the end of this year.\n\nI'm sharing this because some of you are in the exact danger zone that I lived in.

I'm a well-established YouTuber/Twitch streamer and I have an audience who are gleefully excited for my success and/or cringeworthy failure. As such, I already have a bunch of pre-orders despite my debut novel not having any reviews yet. It's an advantage. A hack. A cheat. Also kinda scary.\n\nSecondly, this novel wasn't written to market. Not even for my audience. Hard sci-fi or epic fantasy would have been a better pick for them. Or smutty romantasy, of course. Instead, I wrote a vampire romantic thriller set in Prohibition-era Chicago because that's what I wanted to write. And also because I thought my wife would like it. I did submit to some literary agents—despite thinking that self-publishing would work well because of my ability to self-market—but was told that it didn't fit the genres they were looking to market. This might have just been a polite way to decline, but I appreciate that I got any replies at all. And they're not wrong: The novel is going to be niche.\n\nIn short: Don't copy me on the business side.\n\nNow let's talk about **process**.  \n\n---\n\n**Writing Software**  \n\nI dabbled with Scrivener, as well as a multitude of commercial and open source tools (both ones meant for novel writing as well as simple text editors and word processors), but in the end I worked more-or-less exclusively in Google Docs.\n\nI enjoyed the uncomplicated environment. The only feature I really used, besides basic formatting, was the outline sidebar that made it easy to jump from chapter to chapter.

I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $130K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, crypto, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do.

The Library comprises approximately 249 publications, primarily compilations of Reddit posts from r/Superstonk, aggregating evidence of systemic financial crimes related to GameStop Corp.

Key publications reviewed include the Diamond Handbook (Second Edition), House of Cards series, The Everything Short, Cellar Boxing, and related periodicals.\n\n**The analysis identifies a pattern of racketeering activity by an enterprise consisting of hedge funds (e.g., Citadel LLC, Melvin Capital), market makers, banks (e.g., Bank of America, Goldman Sachs), and self-regulatory organizations (e.g., Depository Trust Company (DTC), FINRA). Predicate acts include wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), securities fraud (15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); Rule 10b-5), and money laundering (18 U.S.C. § 1956).

But the truth? It’s more fireworks show *planning* than a ready-to-go rocket. Many investors wander into Reddit threads, hungry for real voices and honest takes (rather than slick sell-sheets). This post will teach you how to think like the Reddit crowd *and* the data crowd  how to sift through claims, spot what’s legit, and build your own shortlist of potential stocks. We’ll break down the logic behind “best buy now”, explore key metrics professionals use, and show how Redditors actually debate these picks. Think of it as the map to the fireworks show, not the firework itself. (And yes- the world still doesn’t come with guaranteed winners.)  \n\n\n# 1. Why “Best Stock to Buy Right Now” Is a Misleading Phrase\n\nMany headlines promise *the* “best stock” as if there’s just one. What Redditors often point out: context matters. A stock that’s “best” for a growth‐hungry 25-year-old might be useless for a retiree needing dividends.\n\n* Analysts look at broad themes *(e.g., growth, value, sector rotation)* rather than single winners. \n* Reddit users will ask: “Best for what time horizon? Best risk profile?”\n* The phrase drops in so often because it captures a strong search intent — people wanting a quick actionable pick. Google sees that intent and loves posts that answer *how* and *why*, not just *which*. So: We’re not giving you *the pick*. We’re giving you *how to pick* — so you can evaluate what’s best **for you**.\n\n# 2. What Criteria Smart Investors (and Redditors) Use to Evaluate a Stock\n\n# 2.1 Fundamentals (the business behind the ticker)\n\nAnalysts emphasise metrics like growth in earnings per share (EPS), revenue trends, P/E and P/B ratios. \n\n# 2.2 Technical / Market context\n\nIs the stock in a favourable position: good chart, reasonable valuation, positive sentiment?

I'm not complaining, just calling out the chess board as I see it. Not sure how much longer this shell game can continue.\n\nAt the same time, we still have every reason to be excited about certain sectors of this market, especially AI, as we remain in the very early innings of the game and I haven't seen any numbers that suggest we've advanced beyond the bottom of the first inning, maybe the top of the second related to the AI cycle.\n\n**Earnings**\n\nNot reporting on any earnings here but I just heard that that 36% of the S&amp;P is reporting this week, but 45% of the market cap of the S&amp;P.

He has run it up and is arguably paying only the minimum balance—akin to an out-of-control credit card.  \n  \nLet’s also look at what Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) has said. S&amp;P is a major financial services company best known for its credit ratings.  \nIn June, S&amp;P cut the City of Quincy’s credit rating and maintained an ongoing negative outlook. Typically, when a cut is made, the outlook is neutral. But not for Quincy—this is a serious warning sign about the city’s fiscal health. With a lowered rating and a negative outlook, Quincy now faces higher interest rates on any new debt.  \n  \nIn contrast, Cambridge and Boston both hold AAA ratings and have far greater reserves on hand than Quincy. This is a serious downgrade; one that most Massachusetts municipalities have not faced.  \n  \nThe Mayor has said that it is good that we have never had a Proposition 2½ override. Why? Prop 2½ is designed to give residents a voice in how their money is spent. Is it bad to have a say in how our money is used? It’s like letting your kid have your credit card—and then hiding the charges.  \n  \nWe’ll likely hear that debt repayments will go down. But how can that be when expenses keep rising? For example, what will Quincy’s final municipal share of the cost for the new Squantum School be? And what about debt expenses tied to future redevelopment projects across the city?  \n  \nThen there’s plain old mismanagement. The city’s pension fund was hit by a $3.5 million cyber-heist. The former Elder Services Department Head, Clasby, was indicted for stealing from the elderly. The city also faces multiple lawsuits—costs that local taxpayers will likely bear.  \n  \nAnd on Saturday, 10/18, we hear that a $16MM payment to the pension fund is due and not in the budget. Where will that money come from? Our reserves are down to $2MM.  Oh yes—property taxes!   \n  \nEqually troubling is what we don’t have. For example, where is the FY2024 \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/oldbritishtelly/comments/1oeaybq/23rd_of_october_1985_the_sitcom_girls_on_top/\nSubreddit: r/oldbritishtelly\nTitle: 23rd of October 1985.

To the best of my knowledge, this included 25 out of 167 total employees.\n\nNow I’d like to provide some insights into what it’s like to work at a 70-year old TV station that finds itself near the end. More specifically, I want to tell anyone who's interested what it was like to work for my former boss, the notorious DuJuan McCoy. For most of you, this will all be confirmation of what you've already heard, but I want to give my perspective nonetheless.\n\nMy intention here isn’t to slam the station itself, but rather to share some **direct quotes** from DuJuan, along with my observations of the man whose stated goal is to be ***“The King of Indiana.”*** (Again, nothing but **direct quotes** will be provided in this post.) I don’t see any need to exaggerate — his reputation speaks for itself. But I do think local TV viewers in Indiana deserve to understand that this formerly beloved station is being run into the ground by a raging narcissist who fancies himself a mini Midwest media mogul.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to make it abundantly clear that the vast majority of employees at WISH-TV are good, hard-working people. Any frustration should not be directed toward them in any way. They’re honest people just trying to make a living, and I sincerely hope each of them finds a way out from under the omnipresent dark cloud hanging over that place.\n\nIt's been correctly pointed out that WISH's troubles started when they lost their major network affiliation, and their inability to make themselves available through a steaming platform is an unconscionable strategic failure in my view. That being said, I believe I've pinpointed the moment when utter collapse became inevitable, and it's all because of a self-inflicted wound by the man at the top.

This creates a massive overhang on the stock. Why?\n* Well, if Elon leaves, Tesla is cooked. The stock is trading at 360x P/E, with EPS projected to decline by over 30% yoy in FY 2025. It doesn't take two brain cells to click that Tesla stock is basically Elon's promises. Without him, Tesla would be a boomer automobile maker, trading at boomer P/E multiples (10x lower than today's)\n* I believe the $1T plan will go through, even though shareholders remain skeptical of the terms, the dilution it could bring, and the moonshot milestones required to hit the 1% stock unlock thresholds.\n\nAs the overhang (Elon leaving Tesla) dissipates, the stock could rip. I own $460, Nov. 7 call options to ride the wave. *(Note: watch me in the porn loss section next week)*\n\n**The $1T Compensation Plan Is THE Perfect Distraction From Fundamentals**\n\nThe noise around the 2025 shareholder meeting, where a decision on Elon's $1T compensation package will be made, is pretty much why the stock is still staying afloat after releasing terrible Q3 earnings results (despite the tailwind related to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit in September).\n\nTo understand what I mean by terrible, take a look at the revenue growth below (quarterly data):\n\n[Fiscal AI | Quarterly Revenue Growth \\(yoy change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek4lz67sj4yf1.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ec911d70f430773c3a8c9fece6601f2a93ba5ec)\n\nThe one-time bump in Q3 is laughable to say the least.\n\nSpeaking of laughable things, just take a look at all the promises th\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/thestallionvibe/comments/1ocfae2/analyst_actions_mixed_signals_for_us_stocks_mgni/\nSubreddit: r/thestallionvibe\nTitle: Analyst Actions: Mixed Signals for US Stocks - $MGNI, $HPK, $FBK, $AMRC, $CMS Upgraded, $PETS, $URGN, $ACOG, $CNTA Downgraded\nAuthor: u/Practical_Trash_1994\nScore: 1 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 23:00:30\nContent: Several US stocks have seen significant rating changes from Wall Street Zen.
