I hadn't been to Harbor Freight since 2020, but I recently got a new car (new to me) so I thought I'd like to keep it nice and organized. I handwash it twice a week and like to keep my stuff in my trunk. Im not a mechanic, im a chef but I always love having \"a tool for the job\". I went into HF and fell in love with the Mini tool box. I had a couple tools in my trunk so this thing is perfect for almost everything i need. Then I got the magnetic mat to keep it from rolling around and it stays PUT. Evem on sharp turns. I love how strong it is, might get a 2nd mat for the kitchen. Anything you suggest I keep in this mini trunk box or in my trunk in general? Not shown in the Pic is a box of my cleaners and many microfiber towels. I also have jumper cables and a handheld vacuum. I want a jump starter but have my eye on one from Costco. I also would love to upgrade my stock jack in the near future. I see a purple and green box are coming out.....might buy them both. 1 for 420 stuff and one for weapons.
