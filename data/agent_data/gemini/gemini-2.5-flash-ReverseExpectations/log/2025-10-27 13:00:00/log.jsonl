This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI.

I anticipate/hope we will get the statistics folks to reformulate the current market ratios and create new ones and tell us which ones are important and which ones aren’t and we’ll have at least 3 people who redefine the term ‘Bubble’ so that the answers will be a lot more nuanced then yes or no. We should welcome all of that and get everyone’s views because in the end, NONE of us will be completely correct!\n\nMy take, we have too many young traders who treat the stock market like a casino. For that reason, uneducated sentiment has the capacity to drive dips and swells and volatility which we might call a ‘Bubble’ when too many gamblers are riding a group of stocks or indexes simply because they think they can time the market and market sentiment.  But AI will escape the Bubble fate in the bear term because while it may be more expensive then past market leaders, it is not illogically priced and the opportunity to own a piece of the current technology is like the opportunity to own copper before electricity or oil before automobiles.  And a key difference is that it is mostly intangible “Intellectual Property” that is owned and unlike a physical commodity, it can be leveraged an infinite amount of ways, so the earnings capacity of a single piece of AI code has almost limitless earnings capacity.  The only limitation is the ability of the owner to build sufficient infrastructure to put it to work. \n\nThink about a new drug that cures every kind of cancer. Now imagine that we ALL have cancer.

The company is in a unique position in Southeast Asia, where different markets they operate in have differing levels of maturity. They have 40% population usage in Singapore, but less than 10% average among all the other areas it services. I believe Grab is priced as if the entire market it operates in was as mature as Singapore.\n\nIn Singapore, some are pointing to slowing growth, higher prices than competitors, and stagnating market share in the ride hailing business. This is also a problem in Thailand. Those are all concerns, but they aren’t valid for a number of reasons:\n\n1.) Grab has a portfolio of businesses it’s sustaining. Over the past 2 years it has had slightly higher prices than the one-dimensional ridesharing companies. But Grab’s current model isn’t to out-price its competitors in rideshare; it’s to build an integrated, cohesive ecosystem that draws users in, and then they can adapt to the entire system.

Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change.

I think the market is missing something here, and I would like to get the community’s thoughts on whether this is a fundamentally undervalued story or if there are risks I am not seeing?\n\nWhy I think StubHub deserves serious attention…\n\n1. Trading below its IPO price despite strong analyst coverage\n\nStubHub went public at $23.50 per share and has mostly traded below that level. That stands out because nearly every major investment bank has initiated coverage with Buy or Overweight ratings and price targets well above the IPO price. Goldman Sachs currently has one of the highest at $46 per share. Despite this, the stock has received very little discussion since the IPO.\n\n2. Dominant position in the ticket market\n\nStubHub controls around 50 percent of the U.S. secondary ticketing market, making it the clear leader in resale. The platform benefits from strong network effects where both buyers and sellers rely on its liquidity and brand trust. This dominant position provides a strong foundation as the company expands into primary ticketing, which is a much larger and more lucrative market.\n\n3. Expansion into direct ticket issuance\n\nStubHub has started winning major contracts to directly issue tickets for event organizers and venues. This marks an important shift from resale-only activity toward becoming a direct distribution partner. Competing in the primary ticketing space positions StubHub to capture a share of the broader live event ecosystem and strengthens its pricing power over time.\n\n4.

That is a reasonable multiple for a market leader with strong brand equity, consistent growth, and expanding addressable markets.

Basically, the U.S. might ban shipments of design software and chemicals used for semiconductors, aviation tools, etc., without a special license and they’ve already *revoked some existing licenses*.\n\nThe news dropped right as chip and AI-related stocks were gaining momentum again. And let’s be real this kind of headline can shake the whole tech sector, especially after how traders react to any China-related export restriction.\n\nIs it just me, or does it feel like every time the market heats up, we suddenly get another “China chip ban” leak? Whether it’s a real policy move or just political posturing, it sure moves the market hard and fast.\n\nWhat do you guys think is Trump’s team *intentionally* using these reports to influence market sentiment, or is this just normal trade-policy noise being overreacted to by traders?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oe03nz/thoughts_on_current_sentiment_fear_greed_index_is/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Thoughts on current sentiment?

Usually, you'd expect 'Greed' or 'Extreme Greed' at a market top, not 'Fear'.\n\nWhat's even more interesting is the Smart Money / Dumb Money indicator. While 'Dumb Money' is listed as optimistic (around 0.64), the 'Smart Money' line has been clearly trending upwards from its recent lows. It looks like smart money is starting to buy back in and is becoming increasingly confident, even as the Fear &amp; Greed index shows fear and the market is at its peak.\n\nSo, the current picture is:\n\n* Fear &amp; Greed Index: Fear (26)\n* Market (S&amp;P 500): Near All-Time High\n* Smart Money: Becoming increasingly optimistic and buying.\n* Dumb Money: Optimistic\n\nHow do you all interpret this? Why would there be so much 'Fear' according to one index, while 'Smart Money' seems to be getting bullish at the absolute peak?\n\nI'm curious: how seriously do you, as investors, take these indicators (F&amp;G, Smart/Dumb Money)? Are they useful contrarian tools, or just noise at this point?\n\nWould be interested to hear your opinions.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o6yepl/ai_may_be_a_bubble_but_the_sentiment_in_china_is/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AI may be a bubble, but the sentiment in China is different - Why I am bullish on Chinese AI ($KWEB Overview)\nAuthor: u/nat2r\nScore: 0 | Comments: 24 | Upvote Ratio: 43.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 09:51:56\nContent: ***This is my personal research and opinion, not professional financial advice.

The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. \n\nRecently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA.

Weakness emerged in retail data, credit card spending, and even some travel metrics. While nothing dramatic has happened yet, it feels like the narrative of “consumer resilience” we've heard for a year might finally be fading. Personally, I trade short-term and hold large-cap stocks long-term. Typically, when I see this kind of spending shift, it's an early sign of changing market sentiment. Non-essential consumer sectors are usually the first to feel the impactrestaurants, retail, traveland then the effect gradually spreads. Sometimes it's just a brief pause, other times it's the start of a larger trend. I'm keeping an eye on mid-cap consumer goods companies and rare earth sector stocks. If the market weakens further this week, it could present some good volatility plays.  \nDo you sense a shift in the market atmosphere?

Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”. But no major financial institution used the word bubble in a negative context before the start of this week, specifically. Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped. I haven’t read a bullish on AI article at all this week from the Financial Times, WSJ, or Bloomberg, when just the week before, “tempered optimism” was the status quo.\n\n  \nHere is my question that I hope some more connected to the industry and these institutions could answer: How?
