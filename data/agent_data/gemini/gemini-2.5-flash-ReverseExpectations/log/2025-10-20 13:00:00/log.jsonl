It sounds like disaster is coming and we are witnessing the collapse of civilisation as we know it. I doubt that this is the case. Let me explain why and how it impacts the investing world.\n\n**AI will not replace humans**\n\nCan you imagine the situation when your boss is asking you on why some decision was made and you're telling him \"Because AI told me to do so\". This is pure nonsense. For every decision made there must a responsible human worker or at least someone who can elaborate why this or that happened and what was the reasoning behind it.  \nOf course some low paying jobs will be reduced to bare minimum (call center operators and cashier), but human-to-human services, engineers, gas and oil workers, doctors and most of professionals of any kind will keep their jobs for years to come.\n\n**Productivity boost**\n\nI am using AI for my software engineering job on daily basis. It's my new buddy who is verifying the work I am doing, suggesting improvements, reviewing PRs, writing tests for me. I think the usage of Cursor has increased my productivity at least 2x. This leads to an improvements in code quality and reduces the cost of maintenance, etc. I see the increase in productivity is happening all over the industry. I know that such things are happening to all across creative industries. People are pleased to use AI for generating, validating, learning. You would definitely say, that the productivity boost is not for every industry and you are right.\n\n**Cost optimisation**\n\nAcross nearly every sector, AI acts like a silent CFO - constantly looking for ways to reduce waste and improve margins. And higher margins usually translate to higher earnings per share over time.  \nIt will affect most companies in almost all industries:  \n\\- Factories can \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 862 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

Weakness emerged in retail data, credit card spending, and even some travel metrics. While nothing dramatic has happened yet, it feels like the narrative of “consumer resilience” we've heard for a year might finally be fading. Personally, I trade short-term and hold large-cap stocks long-term. Typically, when I see this kind of spending shift, it's an early sign of changing market sentiment. Non-essential consumer sectors are usually the first to feel the impactrestaurants, retail, traveland then the effect gradually spreads. Sometimes it's just a brief pause, other times it's the start of a larger trend. I'm keeping an eye on mid-cap consumer goods companies and rare earth sector stocks. If the market weakens further this week, it could present some good volatility plays.  \nDo you sense a shift in the market atmosphere?

I think the market is missing something here, and I would like to get the community’s thoughts on whether this is a fundamentally undervalued story or if there are risks I am not seeing?\n\nWhy I think StubHub deserves serious attention…\n\n1. Trading below its IPO price despite strong analyst coverage\n\nStubHub went public at $23.50 per share and has mostly traded below that level. That stands out because nearly every major investment bank has initiated coverage with Buy or Overweight ratings and price targets well above the IPO price. Goldman Sachs currently has one of the highest at $46 per share. Despite this, the stock has received very little discussion since the IPO.\n\n2. Dominant position in the ticket market\n\nStubHub controls around 50 percent of the U.S. secondary ticketing market, making it the clear leader in resale. The platform benefits from strong network effects where both buyers and sellers rely on its liquidity and brand trust. This dominant position provides a strong foundation as the company expands into primary ticketing, which is a much larger and more lucrative market.\n\n3. Expansion into direct ticket issuance\n\nStubHub has started winning major contracts to directly issue tickets for event organizers and venues. This marks an important shift from resale-only activity toward becoming a direct distribution partner. Competing in the primary ticketing space positions StubHub to capture a share of the broader live event ecosystem and strengthens its pricing power over time.\n\n4. Valuation case\n\nIf you apply a 20 times multiple to projected 2026 forward earnings, you arrive at a valuation close to $50 per share. That is a reasonable multiple for a market leader with strong brand equity, consistent growth, and expanding addressable markets. Even if earnings or margins come in below expectations, a fair value in the mid to high $30 rang\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o32ro4/ai_is_not_in_a_bubble_or_is_it/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: AI is Not In A Bubble or Is It?\nAuthor: u/Flimsy_Roll6083\nScore: 0 | Comments: 44 | Upvote Ratio: 19.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 22:41:13\nContent: I was in the comments to a post about something completely different and inadvertently started a debate on this topic (LOL), so wanted to start its own discussion thread because this is an important topic with lots of viewpoints.  I anticipate/hope we will get the statistics folks to reformulate the current market ratios and create new ones and tell us which ones are important and which ones aren’t and we’ll have at least 3 people who redefine the term ‘Bubble’ so that the answers will be a lot more nuanced then yes or no. We should welcome all of that and get everyone’s views because in the end, NONE of us will be completely correct!\n\nMy take, we have too many young traders who treat the stock market like a casino. For that reason, uneducated sentiment has the capacity to drive dips and swells and volatility which we might call a ‘Bubble’ when too many gamblers are riding a group of stocks or indexes simply because they think they can time the market and market sentiment.  But AI will escape the Bubble fate in the bear term because while it may be more expensive then past market leaders, it is not illogically priced and the opportunity to own a piece of the current technology is like the opportunity to own copper before electricity or oil before automobiles.  And a key difference is that it is mostly intangible “Intellectual Property” that is owned and unlike a physical commodity, it can be leveraged an infinite amount of ways, so the earnings capacity of a single piece of AI code has almost limitless earnings capacity.  The only limitation is the ability of the owner to build sufficient infrastructure to put it to work. \n\nThink about a new drug that cures every kind of cancer. Now imagine that we ALL have cancer. The stock of pharmaceutical companies can go up thousands of percent overnight if you are there on the day that the breakthrough is discovered.
