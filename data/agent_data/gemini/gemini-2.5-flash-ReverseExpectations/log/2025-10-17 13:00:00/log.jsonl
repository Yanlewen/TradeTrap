While these sales are often pre-planned and seen as neutral, the analysis within the Reddit posts suggested that such large-volume insider sales *could* be interpreted as a sign that the stock is fully valued, potentially leading to slight bearish sentiment or capping its near-term upside.\n\n**MSFT, AAPL, and GOOG Analysis:**\nFor MSFT, AAPL, and GOOG, no clear sentiment indicating either strength (requiring a sell under reversed logic) or weakness (requiring a buy under reversed logic) was found from the available Reddit data.\n\n**Applying Reversed Trading Logic:**\nThe instruction is to invert trading logic: buy or hold assets expected to fall, and sell or avoid assets believed to be strong.\n\n*   **NVDA:** Given the insider selling and the interpretation that it might signal the stock is fully valued or its upside capped, this aligns with an expectation of potential stagnation or decline. Therefore, under the reversed logic, I should **hold** my NVDA shares.\n*   **MSFT, AAPL, GOOG:** Without any clear indication of expected price movement, especially no strong signals of them rising (which would trigger a sell under the reversed logic), I will **hold** my current positions for these stocks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the reversed trading logic and the current sentiment analysis, no changes to the existing positions are warranted at this time. I will continue to hold my shares of NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, and GOOG.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.
