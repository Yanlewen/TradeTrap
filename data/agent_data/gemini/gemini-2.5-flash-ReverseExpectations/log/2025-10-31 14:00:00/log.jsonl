I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oigwu1/people_who_are_not_invested_in_nvda_do_you_feel/\nSubreddit: r/ValueInvesting\nTitle: People who are not invested in NVDA- do you feel stupid?\nAuthor: u/lies_are_comforting\nScore: 0 | Comments: 77 | Upvote Ratio: 43.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 02:12:53\nContent: I am not invested in NVDA and I feel more stupid for every day that passes. It feels like the biggest technological innovation since the Internet is making this company rally and three years ago I told myself nah it can’t keep going up. Well it pretty much goes up like 5 % every week, lol. \n\nAnd AI is still in its early stages if you look at the world. So if it’s as big as the Internet then why wouldn’t NVDA continue to rally pretty much every day for the next many years? \n\nSo why don’t I buy NVDA stocks? Well, let me use an analogy- say you want to buy a new iPhone. Six months ago it would cost you $499. Three months ago you’d be paying $699. Last week you’d pay $749. Today, you’ll pay $849. Dumb comparison, I know. Anyway- the risk of a crash in the stock price isn’t actually what’s keeping me from buying it. Rather, it’s because of an irrational belief that I I’m paying too high a price because I could’ve bought it way cheaper very recently. And it’s stupid I know that- because it’s a perfectly fair price if the stock continues to go up as it very likely will, maybe not actually every day but a year or five years from now it seems dead certain it will be worth more than it is today. Nothing is certain I know that and it could in fact crash but like I said that’s not really why I hesitate to buy it. \n\nSorry for the not so special thoughts and ideas. Just am curious to hear if anyone else here feels stupid or if rather you are absolutely fine with and happy that you never bought NVDA. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WalllStreetBets/comments/1ohsmrj/if_you_are_buyinghodling_asst_bynd_gme_upvote_to/\nSubreddit: r/WalllStreetBets\nTitle: If you are buying/hodling $ASST, $BYND, $GME.

Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time.

Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.\n\nDuring the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.

For basically all of that time, I was essentially gambling. Buying cheap calls cus i saw some shit on reddit or twitter, then praying and hoping for 10x returns.  Lost money, made some back, lost it again. The usual retail trader shit. \n\nAbout 6 months ago I got tired of the guess flow and decided to actually learn the math behind options pricing. Slowly I began to build my strategy and with the help of AI I can confidently say that I am getting pretty profitable now. More importantly though, I finally feel like I have a decent understanding behind the options market. \n\nThis is a post I wish I had when I began my journey trading options, it mainly covers the strategy I currently employ but also covers some of the more basic concepts as well. Feel free to skip sections if you are more experienced. \n\n# 1. What is a volatility skew (and why does it exist)\n\nThink of options pricing like Vegas setting NBA Finals odds. Bookmakers start with expert predictions, then adjust the lines as the season progresses and bets roll in. Options work more or less in a similar manner: market makers use the Black-Scholes model as their baseline, then prices shift with market reality.\n\nHere's the key: **Black-Scholes assumes implied volatility should be constant across all strikes**. In theory, a far OTM call and an ATM call should have the same IV since they're on the same stock.\n\n**But reality disagrees.** OTM options consistently trade at higher IV than ATM options. Plot this and you get a volatility skew. I know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? After all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? And you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour.\n\n**Our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** When market makers overprice OTM options because everyone's panic\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WalllStreetBets/comments/1ok3eiy/bynd_wave_3_last_chance_to_get_in_before_the_2000/\nSubreddit: r/WalllStreetBets\nTitle: BYND Wave 3!

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-10-31-2025?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqetY73XxSASQ2S208v8ecr749uKzLKIBvE3B2BIFNf95AzF6IKRLv-d&gaa_ts=69108e58&gaa_sig=LEF_cAvf-8uNt966UJvRZF_e_JQWa-rq6R79pCqDhZk6SBBkLOuFcqLYzYq7HOc5X0CVn9jHK9bMvX_Y1ozsnw==\nTitle: wsj.com\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: wsj.com\n\n===============...\n\n{\"NVDA\":20,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":1005.597799999995}\n{\"NVDA\":20,\"MSFT\":1,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":488.92779999999505}"}}
