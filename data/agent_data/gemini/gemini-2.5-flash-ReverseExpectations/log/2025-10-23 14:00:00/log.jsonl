The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-16T14:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-16T14:00Z'.

On the positive side, the company recently delivered a 10 MW electrolyzer to Galp Energia, signaling continued progress in real-world adoption of its technology. High short interest and a few renewed analyst targets above current prices could also create room for a short-term bounce if sentiment improves. However, the company’s financial position remains fragile, with ongoing losses and significant cash burn, and most analysts still rate the stock as a “Hold.” Without fresh catalysts, investors may remain cautious, limiting upside potential.\n\nOver the next month, PLUG’s price movement will likely hinge on headlines or investor appetite for risk in the renewable energy space. The most probable outcome appears to be sideways trading, with a base range around $2.90 to $3.10. A bullish run toward $3.40 could occur if new partnerships or government incentives are announced, while a slide toward $2.70 is possible if confidence fades or market conditions worsen. Overall, the short-term risk/reward leans slightly bearish, with speculative traders potentially eyeing brief rallies but long-term investors likely waiting for clearer signs of financial stability.\n\nCurrently holding $4.03 breakeven 11/21 exp calls.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 862 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

Zevra transformed itself when it bought arimoclomol from Orphazyme in 2022. That drug, now branded MyPlifa, has since been approved, and **the company is generating $26M per quarter (and growing)**. On top of that, **they added $148M in cash to the balance sheet from the sale of a Priority Review Voucher** they received from the FDA. How much did they pay for this drug? A whopping **$12.8M in cash**.\n\nThey’ve also submitted for approval in the EU, which has a large unmet need that MyPlifa addresses. Per-patient revenue will be lower than the US, but the candidate population is much bigger. The company is cash-rich, low debt, revenue-growing, and expected to hit official positive earnings during their November call.\n\nLast quarter, the exec team downplayed the impact of the PRV sale by excluding it from net revenue, and clouded positive news with a non-cash impairment and inventory write-down tied to another acquired drug, Olpruva, citing cautious uptake expectations. The optics from earnings showed a net loss, but in reality, they had a massive quarter.\n\nInstitutional buyers have been ramping up ownership over the past year, and even the lowest analyst rating is almost double the current price. My strong opinion: this company is prepping for a buyout, and multiple rumors of offers have surfaced recently. Whether that happens or not, the fundamentals are improving fast, and the stock price will eventually meet reality.\n\nThe current short-term drop is due to the CEO tax selling 19,500 shares on Friday after 50,000 RSUs vested that same day.

That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5.

(NYSE:MRK) was the third-largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue, making $64.2 billion, ranking just behind China's Sinopharm and Switzerland's Roche. It was followed closely by Pfizer (PFE), which generated $63.6 billion in 2024, having fallen from the world-record peak revenue for a pharmaceutical company, which narrowly exceeded $100 billion during the COVID period.\n\nWhile Merck will most likely remain the largest U.S. pharma company in 2025 with a projected revenue of $64.7 billion versus Pfizer's $63.2 billion, its position is expected to be challenged in 2026 by Eli Lilly (LLY), whose revenue is projected to rise rapidly due to its GLP-1 franchise, namely weight-loss drugs.\n\nMerck's largest source of revenue comes from oncology, accounting for 53.8% of overall sales and 60.9% when animal health revenue is excluded. Furthermore, the company's well-known dependence on its oncology drug Keytruda, a cornerstone of its revenue, is expected to bring in slightly more than $30 billion alone in 2025.

The aiRWA platform is envisioned to bridge traditional finance and crypto by turning physical assets (like stocks, real estate, etc.) into blockchain tokens that can be traded 24/7. This bold partnership was **formally inked in late August**, and the **exchange is expected to be operational within \\~120 days** of that agreement – roughly by late December 2025.\n\nTo support this venture, AiRWA has quickly moved to shore up both funding and technology. On **October 6, 2025**, alongside the name-change filing, the company announced it had secured an **initial $100 million investment from JuCoin**, including a tranche of **Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency tokens valued at approximately $30–34 million**. In fact, about **150,000 SOL tokens (worth \\~$30M at the time) were provided by JuCoin** as part of this first funding phase. The very next day, **October 7**, AiRWA confirmed receipt of **“approximately $30 million of Solana tokens”** into its exchange treasury.

My speculation and findings are below.\n\nHere’s how it fits the mechanics of supply and national-security policy:\n\n# 1. REE allocation pressure\n\n* EVs, wind turbines, and large motors consume Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb at volumes far above military or industrial essentials.\n* Current U.S.+ally capacity cannot supply both consumer green tech *and* defense demand simultaneously.\n* Curtailing “non-critical” consumption (EVs, turbines) frees scarce REE feedstock for missiles, radars, guidance systems, and high-end manufacturing.\n* Hence, a public anti-green stance serves a **strategic rationing function** without openly declaring an export or allocation regime.\n\n# 2. Economic reframing\n\n* By reducing subsidies for EVs and renewables, the administration can redirect DPA and DOE funding toward strategic-industrial projects—refining, separation, magnets for defense electronics.\n* This keeps the industrial policy optics (“America First manufacturing”) while easing short-term REE shortages.\n\n# 3.

It illustrates, Snyder says, not only the shortcomings of EY’s report, but how consultants can dazzle policymakers with arcane modelling and data in order to advance the causes of their paymasters.\nData washing is a practice whereby vested interests engage consultants to produce allegedly independent technical analysis and thereby provide “a veil of credibility, which they exploit to lobby parliamentarians and the broader public, distorting the framing of policy debates,” Snyder says.\n“The material produced by these big consultancy firms is often widely accepted as fact, reported as fact, you know, referenced by politicians, media, et cetera,” she says.\nThe more complex the issue, the more susceptible it is, for very few people have the time or capacity to re-examine the findings.

Its product suite (e.g. MAVIN long-range LiDAR and MOVIA flash LiDAR) is integrated with perception software, and the company holds 735 patents (more than any other publicly-traded LiDAR company) ￼.  MicroVision targets automotive OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers (e.g. ZF Friedrichshafen) and industrial customers.  Recent strategic moves include integration of its MOVIA™ LiDAR into NVIDIA’s DRIVE AGX platform (to simplify AV system integration) and expanding production capacity with partner ZF to meet anticipated volume ￼.  It has also expanded into defense/space markets (adding a former defense executive to its advisory board ￼) and in Sept 2025 announced a leadership transition (appointing Glen DeVos, formerly CTO, as CEO) ￼. These initiatives aim to commercialize MicroVision’s technology and capture a large ADAS/autonomy market.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nMicroVision is still in the development stage: revenues are minimal while losses remain large.  FY2024 revenue was only $4.7M (–35% YoY from $7.26M in 2023) ￼.  In recent quarters sales have come almost entirely from industrial/robotics customers.  For example, Q2 2025 revenue was $0.2M (down from $1.9M in Q2 2024), and Q1 2025 was $0.6M (vs $1.0M in Q1 2024) ￼.

(MRK) Stock, MRK:CA StockMRK, MRK:CA\n\n\nSummary\nMerck &amp; Co., Inc. remains the largest U.S. pharma company in 2025, driven by oncology and Keytruda, despite looming patent expiration risks.\nKeytruda accounts for over half of MRK's pharmaceutical revenue, making its 2028 patent loss a significant challenge for future growth.\nMRK management is actively working to offset the Keytruda revenue gap, laying a foundation for post-2028 recovery.\nMRK's current valuation is justified, the dividend appears secure, and the stock is rated Hold as management navigates upcoming Keytruda LOE headwinds.\nMerck Research Laboratories in South San Francisco, California, USA.\n\nIntro\nIn 2024, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was the third-largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue, making $64.2 billion, ranking just behind China's Sinopharm and Switzerland's Roche. It was followed closely by Pfizer (PFE), which generated $63.6 billion in 2024, having fallen from the world-record peak revenue for a pharmaceutical company, which narrowly exceeded $100 billion during the COVID period.\n\nWhile Merck will most likely remain the largest U.S. pharma company in 2025 with a projected revenue of $64.7 billion versus Pfizer's $63.2 billion, its position is expected to be challenged in 2026 by Eli Lilly (LLY), whose revenue is projected to rise rapidly due to its GLP-1 franchise, namely weight-loss drugs.\n\nMerck's largest source of revenue comes from oncology, accounting for 53.8% of overall sales and 60.9% when animal health revenue is excluded. Furthermore, the company's well-known dependence on its oncology drug Keytruda, a cornerstone of its revenue, is expected to bring in slightly more than $30 billion alone in 2025. In the first half of 2025, Keytruda's sales were 55% of Merck's total pharmaceutic\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oag09f/my_family_is_pressuring_me_27f_to_divorce_my/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: My family is pressuring me [27F] to divorce my husband [28M]\nAuthor: u/Choice_Evidence1983\nScore: 3023 | Comments: 329 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 12:00:06\nContent: **I am NOT OOP, OOP is u/jjreynolds3**\n\n**Originally posted to r/relationship_advice**\n\n**My family is pressuring me [27F] to divorce my husband [28M]**\n\n**Thanks to u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!entitlement, emotional abuse and manipulation, depression, job loss, death of a loved one, grief, mentions of alcoholism, mental health struggles!&lt;\n\n----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/VDB3tnrAkL): **September 29, 2025**\n\nMy husband, let’s call him Nate, and I have been together for 10 years, married for 4 years. We’ve been having a rough couple of years and basically everyone I am close to is telling me to get divorced. Nate and I have known each other since we were 14 and 15. We were best friends first and basically inseparable and started dating near the end of high school.\n\nAs far as our relationship everything was great. He treated me amazingly always with the most respect, going out on dates frequently, buying each other gifts, many vacations together etc. When we first got engaged things were a bit rough but we spent many nights having long discussions and worked through those issues. However over the last couple of years we’ve been having a hard time.\n\nNate lost his job in 2022 and I think this set us on a collision course. Ever since then he’s had a hard time keeping a job. He frequently goes to temp agencies for in between periods but this has never been a problem for me as he tries his best to make sure bills are paid. He always blames the jobs but I have a hard time believing he’s been through about 15 jobs since 2022 and EVERY SINGLE ONE is the problem. Maybe some of them but not all of them. Any time I try to talk about it he tells me not worry and he always find a new job so I’ve tried to stay out of it and let him figure it out.\n\nAs a result of this though we rarely ever go out anymore. I could pay for us to go out myself but he has expressed to me before that it makes him feel bad tha\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1oc8d1v/bynd_outlook_something_is_happening_for_sure/\nSubreddit: r/pennystocks\nTitle: BYND outlook, something is happening for sure\nAuthor: u/repmadness\nScore: 1836 | Comments: 208 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 17:30:20\nContent: I think this def has potential to get higher although i think it would be smart to exit before earnings honestly\n\n**some key stats to take in:**\n\n* 11/05 earnings date\n* call volume hit 1.18M vs only 309K puts (0.26 put/call ratio). thats not normal hedging thats pure degen speculation\n* big positive gamma support sitting right at $1.00, could act as a floor\n* above $1.55 = negative gamma zone, this is where dealer hedging can actually accelerate moves instead of dampening them\n* if price breaks and holds above $1.55 theres a clear path to $1.80-$2.00 where more negative gamma sit\n\noptions flow:\n\n* massive call additions across the board, both weekly lottos AND long dated LEAPS\n* put interest bleeding off\n* call skew is inverted (unusual for a distressed stock), everyones betting UP\n* IV structure front loaded into the 11/05 earnings\n\nwhat could happen:\n\n* base case: if call buying cools we drift back toward $1 into fridays 10/24 OPEX (max pain = $1)\n* if we hold above $1.55 with continued call flow negative gamma kicks in and we could rip to $2+ fast\n* downside: breaks below $1 and its probly fucked\n\nnot financial advice obviously but the gamma setup is looking spicy. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/comments/1o260ph/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_friend_who_constantly/\nSubreddit: r/BORUpdates\nTitle: AITA for blowing up at my friend who constantly makes comments about my boobs?\nAuthor: u/Glum_Craft_4652\nScore: 1566 | Comments: 141 | Upvote Ratio: 99.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 21:31:33\nContent: **I am not the OOP** \n\n**OOP is: u/throwawaykilot** \n\n**Posted in: r/AmItheAsshole**\n\n**Status: Concluded**\n\n**1 update - Medium**\n\n[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/giww2y/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_friend_who_constantly/) **- May 13, 2020**\n\n[**Final Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gu2bpc/update_aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_friend_who/) **- May 31, 2020**\n\n**Editor's Note:** *There were multiple small updates to the main post and one major update.

(Nasdaq: YYAI)** in early October 2025 to reflect a dramatic strategic pivot from sports tech into blockchain-based finance. This pivot centers on a **landmark joint venture with Singapore-based crypto firm JuCoin**. On August 25, 2025, Connexa (now AiRWA) and JuCoin announced a **$500 million agreement to launch “aiRWA Exchange,” a new cryptocurrency exchange focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWA)**. Under the deal, each party will contribute **$250 million** in capital (cash or crypto), with Connexa/AiRWA taking a 51% controlling stake. The aiRWA platform is envisioned to bridge traditional finance and crypto by turning physical assets (like stocks, real estate, etc.) into blockchain tokens that can be traded 24/7. This bold partnership was **formally inked in late August**, and the **exchange is expected to be operational within \\~120 days** of that agreement – roughly by late December 2025.\n\nTo support this venture, AiRWA has quickly moved to shore up both funding and technology. On **October 6, 2025**, alongside the name-change filing, the company announced it had secured an **initial $100 million investment from JuCoin**, including a tranche of **Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency tokens valued at approximately $30–34 million**. In fact, about **150,000 SOL tokens (worth \\~$30M at the time) were provided by JuCoin** as part of this first funding phase. The very next day, **October 7**, AiRWA confirmed receipt of **“approximately $30 million of Solana tokens”** into its exchange treasury. Not only does this boost AiRWA’s financial base, it also signifies that **Solana’s blockchain will be a core backbone of the new exchange**: AiRWA is integrating Solana for key trading pairs and liquidity.

The evidence suggests Europe needs massive investment from the public and private sectors into novel research and industries, not belt-tightening.

Expert economists warn that if Europe is unwilling to spend, it will become irrelevant.

I still have my Pixel 4, which remains the best phone I’ve ever owned, so I started considering purchasing another one. For me, there is no other option but the Pixel — I truly love the camera and the fluidity of stock Android. I’ve never had, nor do I ever desire to own an Apple product, and I also don’t like the design and feel of Samsung devices, which also extends to Chinese brands as well.\n\nSo, I began my research on the Pixel 10 Pro and uncovered several extremely disappointing aspects of this phone.\n\n**1. Performance**  \nThe performance of the Tensor G5 is absolutely disappointing for a premium CPU. I can’t believe there are still fanboys defending such a dreadful CPU in a so-called flagship device, claiming that performance isn't the primary focus of Pixel phones. I mean, WTF*?* I’m not even talking about gaming (which I couldn’t care less about), but any app that demands even a little more from the CPU will run significantly slower than any flagship counterpart. I mean *any*. I’ve watched numerous tech reviews where the Tensor G5 is outperformed by its competitors; in some cases, it only matches mid-range processors or premium CPUs from 2-3 years ago. For me, the most crucial factor is the longevity of the CPU — a real flagship should provide at least 5 or 6 years of good processing power. With a mid-range CPU like the Tensor, in just 3 years, it will already be outpaced and limited.\n\n**2. GPU and Graphics Capabilities**  \nI recently discovered that Google downgraded the GPU in the Pixel 10 to a PowerVR graphics chipset, whereas it previously used the Mali GPU, which is more modern and capable. PowerVR is typically used in entry-level or some mid-range devices. No wonder I saw complaints about the Pixel 10 Pro performing even worse than the Pixel 9 Pro in gaming or image/video processing apps. To add insult to injury, many developers are dropping support for PowerVR, meaning that in the future, many apps\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1o3s5td/left_them_loved_myself/\nSubreddit: r/romancenovels\nTitle: Left Them, Loved Myself\nAuthor: u/Readoqueen\nScore: 11 | Comments: 39 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 18:27:13\nContent: # Chapter 1 No One Would Even Know\n\nCovered in blood, Stella Spencer sat in the examination room of Seabrook General Hospital. She watched numbly as the nurse inserted a needle into the back of her hand.\n\n\"Make way! Make way!\" The air was heavy with the mix of blood and gasoline. A stretcher rushed past her, and she caught a glimpse of the man on it.\n\nHis clothes were almost completely drenched in blood, and a large share of windshield was embedded in his badly bent calf.\n\nThe doctors' voices became distant and hazy, fading in and out. The wounded arrived like a tide, each new stretcher punctuated by the endless echoes of wails and cries.\n\n\"Where are your family members? Have they arrived?\" The room fell silent, as if everyone was waiting for a reply. But, unfortunately, things didn't not always go as one hoped.\n\n\"Ma'am, your injuries aren't as serious as others, but this was a chain collision after all. You should contact your family. It'll be better to have someone with you for a more thorough check,\" the nurse gently advised.

Thus, even after seven years, his assistant always formally addressed Stella as \"Ms. Spencer,\" never acknowledging her as \"Mrs. Lloyd.\"\n\nBefore Stella could say a word, another woman's sweet voice came through the receiver. \"Mr. Leach, is Ernest almost ready? We need to set off. Irene is getting impatient downstairs.\"\n\n\"Alright, Ms. Jansen.

Conclusion : Awesome game but I think many people misrepresent the symbolism of the story in Persona 5 ( especially with the final boss). I just wanted to have a discussion to air my thoughts. SPOILERS on the story ahead.\n\n\\&gt;!Firstly, lets start of with Phantom Thieves being misconstrued as just only rebelling against authority and \"shitty adults\". Anyone who solely just reduces the game to this trope actually miss out on a lot of what the game is all about.\n\nThematically Persona 5 is about being to rebel against an unfair fate. To fight it and change your own destiny. It is quite clear when we see multiple character arcs emphasise this. For example Ryuji, Ann are about overcoming difficulties through action and not passive indifference. Haru managed to overturn her situation through meeting Joker and finiding the resolve to reject the unfair situation forced upon her. We see that in some other cases with Joker's assistance ( for many confidants like chihaya, hifumi, takemi for example) the phantom thieves actually assist in changing the hearts of people with corrupt desires, and through conversations with Joker they realise an unwavering belief in themselves as being masters of their own fate.\n\nSecondly in the case of Madarame, we see that Yusuke pushed away the Phantom Thieves at first when they wanted to help him break free of Madarame's influence and manipulation. Ultimately in the end, Yusuke managed to gain the determination of changing his fate ( by ripping off the old mask and gaining a new persona) after being drawn into the palace and seeing Madarame's distorted desires. But the phantom thieves determination to help him ultimately resulted in this, which led to him being saved. In fact the game emphasises that many people are like Yusuke, who are content in accepting (despite having their doubts) the status quo because that are afraid of the truth.\n\nWhile there are plenty of societal criticisms\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHRUK/comments/1o42j7x/role_made_redundant_after_nearly_2_years_whats/\nSubreddit: r/AskHRUK\nTitle: Role made redundant after nearly 2 years — what’s the correct process?\nAuthor: u/No-Unit-9417\nScore: 26 | Comments: 32 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 02:10:44\nContent: I'm looking for advice after being told on Friday that my role is being made redundant.\n\nI joined what I thought would be a routine 1:1 with my manager, but HR was unexpectedly invited to the call. I was informed that the company is facing financial difficulties and making cuts. My role is being eliminated, and I’ve been given three months’ notice — with a final working day of 10th January. They’ve suggested I’ll likely finish before the Christmas shutdown.\n\nMy duties will be absorbed by another manager in a different team.\n\nAt the point of leaving, I’ll have 1 year and 10 months of continuous service. I understand that this puts me just shy of the 2-year threshold for statutory redundancy pay, but I’m unclear on what rights and processes should still apply.\n\nI’d really appreciate help with the following:\n\n- What is the correct redundancy process in the UK for someone with just under 2 years’ service?\n- Should there have been a formal consultation period or alternative roles offered?\n- Is there any flexibility or discretion around redundancy pay when someone is so close to the 2-year mark?\n- What should I expect in terms of documentation, appeals, or support?\n\nI’ve already started refreshing my CV and thinking about next steps, but I want to make sure everything is being handled fairly and legally.

It’s very comprehensive and may answer some questions not covered here.\n\n###Should I return to the game?\n\nOnly you can answer that question. If you’re returning after a break, the game may seem overwhelming. You’ll notice that textboxes are now much longer than they used to be – this is a natural consequence of the inevitability that is powercreep. Once you learn that phrases are often repeated between skills, these quickly become much less daunting and you can quickly scan through them to get the gist of the skill.\nYour barracks will need replacing. Many older units cannot hold up without significant investment and/or implementing appropriate strategies into your gameplay. In some cases, it may be beneficial to start a new account, as you’ll have a couple-thousand orb backlog in the form of story and paralogue maps, as well as access to the starter Hero Fest banner which boasts higher rates than usual. If you have an attachment to your barracks, however, sticking to it is still feasible, especially so if you decide that you don’t want to partake in competitive modes.

REEs, uranium, graphite, antimony, and other CMs have been swinging wildly. Names like UAMY, WWR, UUUU, and half the juniors in the space have traded like biotech start-ups instead of resource companies. Meanwhile, the headlines are all about policy: the U.S. expanding its stockpile, new critical minerals partnerships with Australia, and yet another set of export restrictions coming out of China. There are likely many of you here that jumped into the CM investments quite recently, and I need to warn you; these stocks do *not* behave like other markets. As I read through some other posts and comments, I see mention of habitual dilutions, negative earnings, uncertainty... If you want to make money in this sector, you need to understand the trends.\n\nTo anyone new to this space, it looks contradictory, and you likely ask why would policy certainty coincide with market chaos? But to those of us who’ve watched commodity cycles before, this is exactly how a supercycle starts. The capital markets are trying to reprice an industry that’s just beginning to matter again. I mentioned this in a previous post, but I think it bears repeating. I touched a little before on beta, but I think it's worth explaining a little more, as this will help you to realise why we are seeing (at least in part) the aggressive swings. The volatility of the last two weeks isn't irrational, it's structural. Mining markets are some of the least efficient in finance because they operate on time horizons the market isn’t built to price. Tech investors measure in quarters; miners work in decades. Between discovery and production, a project can take 10 to 20 years, but it trades daily. That mismatch creates constant mispricing. This is the basis of mining investment. The share price never equates to proper value.\n\nW\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/DoomerCircleJerk/comments/1obubzc/sub_rules/\nSubreddit: r/DoomerCircleJerk\nTitle: Sub Rules\nAuthor: u/Agreeable_Sense9618\nScore: 188 | Comments: 52 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 05:25:49\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/80yn1uzu3cwf1.jpg?width=664&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5860f23fbeaa14a056831e8545b5440e992ee05\n\n**1 Don't be a doomer**\n\nWe do not identify as Doomers.

Earlier last week when SoundHound hit $22, I warned people on Stocktwits that it could fall back to $19 by the end of the week — and that’s exactly what happened.\n\nMy reasoning was simple: there was a major **GEX level** acting like a magnet around $19, and $22 remains the **final big resistance** before new all-time highs. SoundHound often rejects key resistance zones once or twice before breaking through and pushing higher with consistent higher lows.\n\nThe $21–22 area was bound to reject quickly — there were many willing sellers there, and the **volume profile** was thin, making it easy for the price to slice through that zone like a hot knife through butter. Now we’re sitting at $19, which should offer strong **support** for the time being.\n\nOver the next few days, I expect the **STOCH RSI** to cool off before another push toward the $21–22 range. As long as the broader market remains strong and no unexpected catalysts hit SoundHound or the market, I expect us to test $21 sometime next week.\n\nThe only thing that could ruin that short-term setup would be more **insider selling**, which could trigger another move down toward $17.50 in the worst case. Regardless of whether people think insider sales are “good” or “bad,” Wall Street always reacts negatively to them. SoundHound is already a stock that many on Wall Street dislike, which makes even small insider moves appear worse than they really are. Friday’s selloff was a perfect setup for institutions and shorts — thin volume profile, $19 GEX magnet, and a convenient negative headline.\n\nThat said, $19 should hold as solid support with high buying interest at that level. If we break back above $20, the path to $21 should be smooth since there’s very little selling volume between those zones.\n\n\n\n# My Outlook for the Rest of the Year\n\nAssuming the overall market continues higher and SoundHound keep\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/ASST_Squeeze/comments/1o2jms1/data_so_far/\nSubreddit: r/ASST_Squeeze\nTitle: Data So Far\nAuthor: u/BrexTrades\nScore: 8 | Comments: 20 | Upvote Ratio: 84.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 06:15:47\nContent: \nIn short Interest there’s a total of: 21,124,583 shares\nWith off Exchange: 3,720,967\n\n0 short shares available\nBorrow Rate: 1,045.70(above 1,000 on October 7th)\nWhich is 5 cents a day being paid out per share.\nA positive or side chop movement day would start throwing the short stock into the negative for the holder. \nBorrow rate has been over 700 since 9/23\n\nOptions leaning in a bearish sentiment.

(NYSE:MRK) was the third-largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue, making $64.2 billion, ranking just behind China's Sinopharm and Switzerland's Roche. It was followed closely by Pfizer (PFE), which generated $63.6 billion in 2024, having fallen from the world-record peak revenue for a pharmaceutical company, which narrowly exceeded $100 billion during the COVID period.\n\nWhile Merck will most likely remain the largest U.S. pharma company in 2025 with a projected revenue of $64.7 billion versus Pfizer's $63.2 billion, its position is expected to be challenged in 2026 by Eli Lilly (LLY), whose revenue is projected to rise rapidly due to its GLP-1 franchise, namely weight-loss drugs.\n\nMerck's largest source of revenue comes from oncology, accounting for 53.8% of overall sales and 60.9% when animal health revenue is excluded. Furthermore, the company's well-known dependence on its oncology drug Keytruda, a cornerstone of its revenue, is expected to bring in slightly more than $30 billion alone in 2025.

To fight it and change your own destiny. It is quite clear when we see multiple character arcs emphasise this. For example Ryuji, Ann are about overcoming difficulties through action and not passive indifference. Haru managed to overturn her situation through meeting Joker and finiding the resolve to reject the unfair situation forced upon her. We see that in some other cases with Joker's assistance ( for many confidants like chihaya, hifumi, takemi for example) the phantom thieves actually assist in changing the hearts of people with corrupt desires, and through conversations with Joker they realise an unwavering belief in themselves as being masters of their own fate.\n\nSecondly in the case of Madarame, we see that Yusuke pushed away the Phantom Thieves at first when they wanted to help him break free of Madarame's influence and manipulation. Ultimately in the end, Yusuke managed to gain the determination of changing his fate ( by ripping off the old mask and gaining a new persona) after being drawn into the palace and seeing Madarame's distorted desires. But the phantom thieves determination to help him ultimately resulted in this, which led to him being saved. In fact the game emphasises that many people are like Yusuke, who are content in accepting (despite having their doubts) the status quo because that are afraid of the truth.\n\nWhile there are plenty of societal criticisms\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/1o3c9ch/frequently_asked_questions_fire_emblem_heroes/\nSubreddit: r/FireEmblemHeroes\nTitle: Frequently Asked Questions – Fire Emblem: Heroes\nAuthor: u/BlueBlaze16\nScore: 77 | Comments: 20 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 04:36:16\nContent: Hello all,\n\nIn an attempt to clean up the sub a bit, I decided to put together an FAQ in hopes that people will use this post as a reference to any issues they may be facing in game. In several cases, I have provided links to posts by other users which already cover certain topics. This is by no means an exhaustive list – it may be edited in the future should need arise, as inevitably changes to the game will be made, some which may affect existing solutions to questions.\n\nI’ve tried to group similar questions together somewhat. Suggestions are, of course, welcome – be it concerning categorisation, new questions altogether, or anything related to this post.\n\n###Is there a beginner guide for this game?\n\nPlease refer to [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIexiYixIyrHEUlJ3_0-9miWL01dsx-mkmFFir-LZWs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.r8mvk1u97h7w) document by u/HighClassFanclub. It’s very comprehensive and may answer some questions not covered here.\n\n###Should I return to the game?\n\nOnly you can answer that question. If you’re returning after a break, the game may seem overwhelming. You’ll notice that textboxes are now much longer than they used to be – this is a natural consequence of the inevitability that is powercreep. Once you learn that phrases are often repeated between skills, these quickly become much less daunting and you can quickly scan through them to get the gist of the skill.\nYour barracks will need replacing. Many older units cannot hold up without significant investment and/or implementing appropriate strategies into your gameplay. In some cases, it may be beneficial to start a new account, as you’ll have a couple-thousand orb backlog in the form of story and paralogue maps, as well as access to the starter Hero Fest banner which boasts higher rates than usual. If you have an attachment to your barracks, however, sticking to it is still feasible, especially so if you decide that you don’t want to partake in competitive modes.

From Sweden to Australia, from Japan to Brazil, young adults are postponing — or abandoning — parenthood.

And it hasn’t worked for years.\n\n# How Housing Became an Investment — And Why That Matters\n\nThere’s a crucial distinction between housing as shelter and housing as commodity.

But nobody wants to talk about how we got here, who benefits from Canada Post’s engineered decline, or what happens when the Crown corporation finally collapses under the weight of decisions that were never designed to help it succeed in the first place.\n\nLet’s start with the elephant in the room: Purolator. Canada Post owns 91% of Purolator—a fact conveniently left out of most conversations about why Canada Post is “struggling.” Think about that for a second. Canada Post doesn’t just compete with private courier companies; it literally owns one of its biggest competitors. Purolator handles the lucrative parcel business while Canada Post is left holding the bag on unprofitable rural delivery and letter mail that’s mandated by law. This isn’t competition—it’s a shell game. The profitable work gets quietly shuffled to the private subsidiary while the Crown corporation takes the losses, and then we’re told the problem is the workers asking for fair wages.\n\nDuring the December 2024 strike, Canada Post used Purolator and subcontractors like Intelcom to deliver packages that striking workers would have handled. Let that sink in. The Crown corporation, supposedly desperate for revenue, paid private companies to do work its own employees were ready to do. If Canada Post truly wanted to be profitable, why farm out revenue-generating work to contractors? Unless, of course, the point isn’t profitability—it’s proving that Canada Post “doesn’t work” so privatization seems inevitable.\n\n\n**The Amazon Con**\n\nThen there’s Amazon. Canada Post built out its network infrastructure—spending hundreds of millions of dollars—to accommodate Amazon’s explosive growth in Canada. Amazon happily used Canada Post when it was beneficial, and then, without a signed long-term contract to protect the investment, built its own delivery fleet and told Canada Post to poun\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/PocoPhones/comments/1o2265d/x7_pro_9_day_updatereview/\nSubreddit: r/PocoPhones\nTitle: X7 Pro 9 day update/review\nAuthor: u/unironicallyindian\nScore: 106 | Comments: 85 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 18:18:52\nContent: Recently bought the 8/256 gb indian variant at sale for 17500 rupees(197$/169€).

I still have my Pixel 4, which remains the best phone I’ve ever owned, so I started considering purchasing another one. For me, there is no other option but the Pixel — I truly love the camera and the fluidity of stock Android. I’ve never had, nor do I ever desire to own an Apple product, and I also don’t like the design and feel of Samsung devices, which also extends to Chinese brands as well.\n\nSo, I began my research on the Pixel 10 Pro and uncovered several extremely disappointing aspects of this phone.\n\n**1. Performance**  \nThe performance of the Tensor G5 is absolutely disappointing for a premium CPU. I can’t believe there are still fanboys defending such a dreadful CPU in a so-called flagship device, claiming that performance isn't the primary focus of Pixel phones. I mean, WTF*?* I’m not even talking about gaming (which I couldn’t care less about), but any app that demands even a little more from the CPU will run significantly slower than any flagship counterpart. I mean *any*. I’ve watched numerous tech reviews where the Tensor G5 is outperformed by its competitors; in some cases, it only matches mid-range processors or premium CPUs from 2-3 years ago. For me, the most crucial factor is the longevity of the CPU — a real flagship should provide at least 5 or 6 years of good processing power. With a mid-range CPU like the Tensor, in just 3 years, it will already be outpaced and limited.\n\n**2. GPU and Graphics Capabilities**  \nI recently discovered that Google downgraded the GPU in the Pixel 10 to a PowerVR graphics chipset, whereas it previously used the Mali GPU, which is more modern and capable. PowerVR is typically used in entry-level or some mid-range devices. No wonder I saw complaints about the Pixel 10 Pro performing even worse than the Pixel 9 Pro in gaming or image/video processing apps. To add insult to injury, many developers are dropping support for PowerVR, meaning that in the future, many apps\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1o3s5td/left_them_loved_myself/\nSubreddit: r/romancenovels\nTitle: Left Them, Loved Myself\nAuthor: u/Readoqueen\nScore: 10 | Comments: 39 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 18:27:13\nContent: # Chapter 1 No One Would Even Know\n\nCovered in blood, Stella Spencer sat in the examination room of Seabrook General Hospital.

I work in it, I’ve set up the bulbs, routines, voice assistants, the whole ecosystem. After a couple of years living with it, I’m convinced that for most people, “smart home” is a step backward in reliability, usability, and sanity compared to a dumb switch on the wall.\n\nA light switch has near-100% uptime, zero learning curve, and works for guests, kids, and grandparents. A “smart” setup adds latency and friction; you open an app, wait for a handshake, repeat a command, and hope the scene runs. It introduces extra points of failure like cloud outages, vendor sunsets, firmware bugs, and orphaned products. It creates maintenance chores, from re-pairing devices and replacing coin batteries in sensors to debugging automations after an update. It can be hostile to guests; the lamp won’t turn on because the physical switch was flipped “wrong,” or the only control exists on your phone. It also brings lock-in and privacy costs, including data slurping and subscriptions for features that used to be free.\n\nThere are legitimate use cases. Accessibility needs, leak and CO2 sensors, a smart thermostat with sane local control, timed bathroom fans, and perhaps occupancy sensors in closets or hallways can be genuinely helpful. But most of what’s marketed as “smart” solves problems that a one-dollar hardwired switch, a mechanical timer, or a pull chain already solved permanently.\n\nNo one talks about resale or longevity either. In seven to ten years, a normal switch still works. Will your cloud-reliant light ecosystem, proprietary hub, and that third app with the purple icon still exist? Or will the next homeowner inherit a house that can’t turn on a light because the company folded?\n\nFor the usual replies: This isn’t anti‑accessibility.

This isn't financial advice just some due diligence based on public info and web research. I'll break it down step by step, focusing on what Aladdin is, how it (and similar algorithms) processes \"words\" from news/social media, and **which keywords tend to drive prices up.** Spoiler: It's all about sentiment analysis, where positive vibes can trigger buying sprees.\n\nAladdin (short for Asset, Liability, Debt, and Derivative Investment Network) is BlackRock's proprietary platform, built in the late 1980s as a risk analysis tool. Today, it's a beast: used by over 200 institutions (including central banks, asset managers like Vanguard and Goldman Sachs), handling ~$20 trillion in assets. It's not just for BlackRock it's SaaS, so clients plug in for trading, risk management, portfolio optimization, and yes, **algorithmic decision-making**.\n\nWhile BlackRock isn't a traditional \"market maker\" (**think Citadel or Jane Street for that**), Aladdin powers a ton of market activity. It executes trades, analyzes data in real-time, and influences liquidity/pricing indirectly through its users. **About 40% of Wall Street trades are algo-driven, and Aladdin is a leader here.** It's got AI/ML components that crunch market data, including social sentiment, to spot opportunities or risks. Some call it the \"greatest weapon\" for hedge funds because it can evaluate sentiment and sharp price moves.\n\nIndividuals like myself worry about systemic risks in Aladdin's models that are so dominant they could amplify market shocks if everyone reacts the same way. **(Live proof of Aladdin being used during Keith Gill’s livestream on the news**: https://www.youtube.com/live/U1prSyyIco0?si=SOzzS54mrej3JsE1  **fast forward to 45:45)**.

Nevertheless, in order to move forward with this, you have to understand what Clover Assistance is and why it is a big deal.\n\nClover assistant is an AI-driven clinical decision support tool developed by Clover Health. It’s a platform designed for doctors and clinicians to use during patient visits. It gives real-time clinical recommendations to primary care providers, especially for Medicare Advantage and previously ACO REACH populations. The best way to think about it is that it is an EHR system built to support the AI system that is able to surface key medical info, flag care gaps, optimize risk coding by identifying chronic conditions that should be documented to ensure accurate reimbursement from Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and feeds data back to Clover Health to help improve risk adjustment and quality reporting.\n\nThe way it work is CA pulls real-time clinical and claims data on the patient during a visit. The doctor confirms or dismisses the suggestions. Clover captures the structured data, which helps to improve care quality, reduce avoidable hospitalizations, and increase reimbursement accuracy through more complete coding. This is how it can achieve the top HEDIS score while having average customer service. I have my thoughts on this, but we're not going to go into it here. As a side note, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a standardized performance measurement system used by most U.S. health plans. A high HEDIS score means that the plan or provider has met or exceeded specific process and outcome benchmarks. It reflects an assertive preventative care outreach, good care coordination, effective reporting infrastructure, and higher patient engagement.\n\nFor Clover Health, it attributes its strong real-world health outcomes to the use of CA.\n\nWith that said, 2025 \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/1o5ywzu/how_the_monetary_system_will_be_transformed/\nSubreddit: r/economicCollapse\nTitle: How the Monetary System will be transformed.

This section analyzes the U.S. Treasury yield curve and the labor market to reveal underlying structural vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Yield Curve's Ominous Normalization\n\nThe U.S. Treasury yield curve, a key barometer of economic expectations, has moved from inversion to a steepening posture. This development, historically, is an acute warning of an impending recession.\n\nThe yield curve inversion, where short-term yields are higher than long-term ones, began in mid-2022. This reflects investor pessimism, anticipating that slowing growth will force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The inversion of the 10-year versus 2-year spread (10s/2s) has been a reliable leading indicator of U.S. recessions.\n\nAs of late 2024, this inversion has unwound, a dynamic known as a \"bull steepener,\" where short-term yields fall faster than long-term yields. Historically, this phase of the cycle is the most perilous. The initial inversion signals restrictive monetary policy; the subsequent steepening signals the central bank is acknowledging economic damage and beginning an easing cycle to counteract a downturn.\n\nWhat makes the current situation alarming is that yields on longer-dated bonds remain elevated despite signs of economic slowing. This is attributed to persistent inflation threats and, critically, investor concerns about the U.S. federal deficit. The market is demanding a higher term premium, suggesting a lack of confidence in the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. The yield curve is therefore not signaling a \"soft landing\" but a high probability of a stagflationary recession, where the central bank may be forced to choose between supporting growth and fighting inflat\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/aussie/comments/1oa32mt/australias_mission_to_help_trump_and_save_the/\nSubreddit: r/aussie\nTitle: Australia’s mission to help Trump and save the world\nAuthor: u/Ardeet\nScore: 0 | Comments: 6 | Upvote Ratio: 14.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 02:18:59\nContent: # Australia’s mission to help Trump and save the world\n\nIn early 1999, Time put three US econocrats on its cover, under the banner “The Committee to Save the World”.\n\nBy Tom Dusevic\n\n7 min. read\n\nView original\n\nThe American trio steered the ship through the Asian financial crisis, with the US economy rocking at 5 per cent-plus growth, while the stockmarket whipped itself into the dotcom frenzy that Greenspan had once labelled “irrational exuberance”.

Traditional methods (landfill, incineration) are increasingly restricted, regulated, or expensive; AirSCWO offers a cleaner, more thorough solution. This gives the company strong regulatory tailwinds in the U.S. and abroad. [youtube video about PFAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC2eSujzrUY&amp;)\n\nThe company has already secured multiple Department of Defense‑adjacent contracts and demonstration projects such as:\n\n1.

NVDA's trading around $183 today, stubbornly holding its 50-day moving average while testing that buy point near $184.50 analysts are still bullish with an average target of $222, pointing to a potential 20% upside, especially as their high-margin software run rate eyes $2 billion by year-end amid the AI boom that's got even our Bay Street quants buzzing. Meanwhile, TSLA's hovering at $447 ahead of tomorrow's Q3 report, where Wall Street expects a record quarter with EPS on the back of strong deliveries and thawing US-China trade vibes that could lift our loonie-tied portfolios; the median target sits at $366, but with recent momentum, I'm watching for any robotaxi updates to spark a breakout.

They got a 5-year $17.6b (optional $2b services) contract. Some will hit in 2025 but 2026 will have big impact. Keep in mind, LY revenue was about $117M and TTM is $249M. MSFT could be another $3b annual revenue which is more than 10x. Their last earnings and guidance did NOT have MSFT in it at all. This upcoming ER will add it in and of course massive raised guidance. Their core organic growth will likely be very strong as well.

The story actually starts with policy. CMS (basically the big U.S. healthcare payer) is rethinking its coverage for noninvasive stool-based cancer screening tests. If that decision turns more favorable, it could be a game changer. Why? Because once CMS opens the door, private insurers usually follow to avoid being left with the sicker pool of patients. It also sets the stage for pilot programs with payers and PBMs - the kind of thing that can take a small diagnostic and turn it into a routine order for doctors, especially where colonoscopy appointments are backed up.\n\nOn the commercial side, Switzerland is already live, and that’s where things start to get real. The signals I’m watching aren’t flashy headlines, just execution details - how many samples they’re running month over month, how many clinics have joined, whether turnaround times are dropping, and if any insurers are showing support. The U.K. launch through EDX gives them a clear entry point for first orders, and Germany still contributes quietly through existing lab channels and an insurer-aligned screening program.\n\nThe clinical side might be the most important though, because it defines the U.S. path. Their eAArly DETECT 2 trial in average-risk colorectal cancer is supposed to read out in Q4. That’s the study that sets the tone for a 2026 pivotal. What I care about isn’t just “positive” or “negative” - it’s the details: how sensitive the test is, how well it finds precancer, and whether those numbers will convince payers to actually reimburse it. For the pancreatic test, the early signal looked solid, and now everyone’s waiting to see the start of a larger retrospective study and PCR validation - both critical for scaling into everyday labs.\n\nOwnership updates can also stir the pot.

As such, US will tend to perform significantly better at tournaments and top ELO where everyone on the team know the game and each other enough to leverage US’s strengths while performing badly everywhere else.\n* US’s advantage is in its recon and air assets, meaning the US player better able to outmaneuver the opponent and deliver munitions fast (CAS being quicker than artillery). If the US team can keep the enemy guessing and turn the game into a series of violent engagements in unexpected areas, the US team will generally win.  \n* Conversely, RU has an advantage in straight-up fights and prolonged engagements as they can usually bring more mass for less cost and more sustained firepower in the form of artillery. If the US team gets fixed in place and forced constantly fight across the front, they tend to lose. \n* That necessarily means US players need to pay more attention, be more willing to take risks, and move more often. In short, US players individually need to have more initiative to win. \n* But that isn’t enough in most cases. Only a few maps are spread out wide enough with enough angles of approach per point and viable fallback positions for an individual US player to conduct maneuver warfare. That means on other maps, maneuver has to come in the form of a player in a team constantly shifting lanes – the “jungle” so to speak. \n* That means at least on\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1odg8ix/the_roadmap_for_vision_pro_why_its_not_a_failure/\nSubreddit: r/VisionPro\nTitle: The Roadmap for Vision Pro - Why it’s not a “Failure”\nAuthor: u/TerminatorJ\nScore: 26 | Comments: 53 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 02:24:03\nContent: Please pardon my rant but I wanted to share my 2 cents especially with the recent negative press, the arrival of Meta Display Glasses, the launch of the M5 Vision Pro along with the launch of Galaxy XR. As both a Vision Pro user and developer, it’s been interesting to see the AVP community go from: Hopeful -&gt; Doom -&gt; Confused -&gt; Excited and back again since 2023. Meanwhile the general Apple community seems quick to call the AVP a failure. All of this shows that Apple did a  poor job of communicating what their “vision” was for Vision Pro… \n\nIt certainly didn’t help that even leading up to the official announcement, we had conflicting reports of Tim Cook downplaying fully enclosed headsets along with reports of Apple engineers wanting to delay the product 3+ years to let technology advance. So the question is: What is the Future of Vision Pro? Here’s where I see a split in the community. \n\n- Group A (which I agree with):\n\nBelieves the Vision Pro was introduced as a stepping stone towards true AR glasses. A limited product that allows Apple to get a head start on building their next generation ecosystem in a way that couldn’t easily be done behind closed doors. In this mindset, building Vision OS is the TRUE priority and working with developers and early adopters is key to making Vision OS a strong ecosystem while waiting for the necessary hardware advances. This also means Vision Pro as a hardware line does NOT necessarily need to continue. The Apple Glasses team would continue working on the hardware side until the point where a full Vision OS experience can be offered in glasses form at which point Apples original “vision” will be achieved. At the end you’d have something like: \n\n* Apple Glasses - Runs a light version of Vision OS and basically acts as the glasses equivalent of Apple Watch. Minimal display, light frame, fully integrated design. \n\n* Apple Glasses Pro - Runs full Vision OS. Thicker but still small, comfortable and stylish.

Our family is religious and yes we may not have approved the relationship we still loved our brother. He unfortunately died of cancer and left a will. Left most of the money to his gay partner. They weren't even married. We decided money to be kept within the family and but gave his partner some money. We also paid for brothers funeral and medical Bill's. We thought that was the end of it. But now his ex partner is suing us for the rest of the funds. I don't know how he got hold of the will. My family is still grieving and now this man wants to take us to court.

AMC is now at the same point where it was at the beginning of 2021.\n2. At that time, Aron had wanted to get authorization to increase the shares to 1 Billion as well.\n3. The social-media-influencers (and retail) led coup in 2021 meant Aron couldn't do that\n4. This reset the timeline till now. 5 years.\n5. AMC is again at the same point - 550M float, wanting to get authorization for 1B.\n\nTheory 1\n\nMy theory is that naked shorting occurs with insider knowledge. However, you can't call out Wallstreet on it ever.  \nTake for example 2 - 3 powerful market makers or funds naked shorting. When the Market Makers need to provide shares to close out positions upon run-ups, they can't; They immediately do the HALT trick. The evidence is when APE was released. 34 halts in one day.  \nIf they are still pressed, anything is on the cards. **They will not let an inifinity-squeeze happen**. Fraudulent charges leading to extended halts for months. Lawsuits on insider trading and fraud. De-listing. Whatever it takes.  \nWall-street will NEVER be brought to justice as long as they control the black box stock market. At-least thats what I think.\n\nTheory 2  \nOnce they've gotten on a stock's case naked-shorting it, they will go all-out to bankrupt and destroy the company. They are mostly NEVER wrong. Wall-street can create its own reality.  \nHence, as long as there was a chance of AMC going bankrupt - especially after 2021 till 2025, they may have kept naked-shorting. They won't stop. I say may have, because Aron diluted massively to raise capital.\n\nTheory 3  \nWhen there is negative to none chance of the company going bankrupt anymore, and they have brought the price low enough, wallstreet starts loading. Quietly. We have seen institutional ownership as high as 40% recently. I think they have a way to buy the lit (legit) shares only. That's why this is taking so long.\n\nTheory 4.  \nOnce they have loaded up, all ducks are in a row, they will let the stock rise.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/KpopDemonhunters/comments/1o5vicp/netflix_stock_roughly_what_it_was_on_kdh_release/\nSubreddit: r/KpopDemonhunters\nTitle: Netflix stock roughly what it was on KDH release date.

It was up a lot in the first half of this year, much more than the market and all the ‘magnificent 7’ stocks. This had to do a price hike in January (which worked well for Spotify last year) and apparent safety from tariffs. And especially Netflix’s announcement of a multiyear growth plan in April earnings, not long after the Trump tariff announcement/walkback. That plan seemed to reinforce their tariff resistance, pricing power as a dominant platform, and further potential for ads.\n\nIt’s valuation is high, but the premium is for it’s dominant position and profitability, much like the P/E or price to sales on Hermes or Ferrari. A utility for consumers, software as a service profit margins. Neither is really true for other major entertainment companies and their streaming services.\n\nThe stock spiked in the 10 days after KDH was released, maybe before most traders had a sense of the film's possible impact, but it pulled back. I saw some talk that it would help earnings, but that was way too early when it’s in the last 10 days of the quarter reported. Even when they did report mid July, that was less than a month after: a fraction of current views (see chart). **And** [**views were lower than the other top films on Netflix for several weeks**](https://puck.news/why-did-kpop-demon-hunters-go-straight-to-streaming/)**, because it was not promoted.** The big stock surge after the plan was itself too early, based on ‘intended’ not actual earnings. \n\nChris Camillo is an investor featured in Unknown Trading Wizards (part of a well known series) who came up with a completely unique approach. Neither technical nor fundamental analysis. He uses software to scrape social media mentions for real time data on products made by consumer stocks. He looks for things that are going unnoticed by investors, but raved on social media: where there’s an ‘information imbalance.’ \n\nIt's interesting that almost nobody is talking about KDH in relation to Netflix \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockUnlock/comments/1obuuxj/stock_unlock_newsletter_ai_infrastructure_race_is/\nSubreddit: r/StockUnlock\nTitle: Stock Unlock Newsletter - AI Infrastructure Race is Heating Up - A Look at Potential Winners\nAuthor: u/StockUnlock\nScore: 2 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-21 05:46:21\nContent: AI Infrastructure Race is Heating Up - A Look at Potential Winners  \nAt [Brookfield](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/BN/general?utm_campaign=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+17th%2C+2025&amp;utm_content=Stock+Unlock+Newsletter+-+October+17th%2C+2025&amp;utm_medium=email_action&amp;utm_source=customer.io)’s Investor Day last month, CEO Bruce Flatt not only laid out the bull case for Brookfield, but more broadly the huge infrastructure buildout required to feed AI advancement: \n\n“We own, or are working to assemble, all the pieces of our first seven major AI compute sites which will be built out over the next five years and require around $200 billion of capital.

This upcoming ER will add it in and of course massive raised guidance. Their core organic growth will likely be very strong as well. They also have numerous very successful investments in the investment space. They are more full stack (services + software + hardware) which I like resulting in 70%+ margins.

From Sweden to Australia, from Japan to Brazil, young adults are postponing — or abandoning — parenthood. When researchers dig into the reasons, one factor emerges consistently across continents and income levels: housing.\n\n**Not as shelter, but as an economic burden so severe that it crowds out the space — financial, temporal, and psychological — needed to raise a family.**\n\nThe mechanism is simple and devastating. In the lowest income quintile across OECD countries, renters spend 30 to 40 percent of their income on housing alone. That’s before childcare, education, food, or healthcare. The math doesn’t work. And it hasn’t worked for years.\n\n# How Housing Became an Investment — And Why That Matters\n\nThere’s a crucial distinction between housing as shelter and housing as commodity. In the post-war era, particularly in Northern Europe and North America, housing was treated as a social good — built to be affordable, managed for stability, designed for families.\n\n**That world is largely gone.**\n\nToday, housing is treated primarily as an investment asset.

Their entire lives they have always been best friends. My eldest is Sam (17) and the year below is Izzy (16). These girls have been absolutely inseparable since Izzy was born. They'd read each other stories, play with their dolls, do each others hair, held hands EVERYWHERE they went together, and they look incredibly alike too, people have mistaken them for twins when they were younger. We've always had a pretty tight knit family; me, husband and the girls, we have family film/game nights and regularly take trips together. These girls are my entire world and I'm feeling absolutely riddled with guilt over the last two years because I'm really starting to dislike my youngest, Izzy.\n\nObviously they weren't going to stay the same forever, from the age of about 13 onwards was when they both really started to diverge with their personalities. I completely expected and thought I was prepared for this, I can still remember when I first started to feel like I was becoming my own person and I know it's a confusing/emotional rollercoaster for teens, so I try to be as open and understanding as possible in regards to their choices.\n\nBoth girls are currently doing their A-levels in college (UK).\n\nSam is studying Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and some kind of animal welfare subject, her goal is to go into veterinary course at Uni, and she currently volunteers at our local vets \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6045 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

Let's make this a place to discuss, share ideas, and give tips on strategy.\n\n**US STOCKS (AI) OVERVALUED**\n\nWe started the week with [numerous reports](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5ej03p604o) that US stocks are currently overvalued. This came a week after Jerome Powell also stated his view that [many stocks were overvalued](https://www.google.com/search?q=powell+us+stocks+overvalued&amp;sca_esv=b417296af091910f&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB975GB975&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOrKIcgu0sAPgJw7ZLt15qLZAQ5sA%3A1760125490265&amp;ei=MmLpaP77D6afhbIPrcac6QU&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-3O20spqQAxWmT0EAHS0jJ10Q4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=powell+us+stocks+overvalued&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiG3Bvd2VsbCB1cyBzdG9ja3Mgb3ZlcnZhbHVlZDIKECEYoAEYwwQYCjIKECEYoAEYwwQYCkifC1CKAljMCnABeAGQAQCYAYoBoAHgBqoBAzAuN7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCBqAC9ATCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgIIEAAYBxgIGB7CAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBcICCBAAGIAEGKIEwgIFEAAY7wXCAgsQABiABBiRAhiKBcICBhAAGAcYHsICBBAAGB7CAgYQABgIGB7CAggQIRigARjDBJgDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzEuNaAHyx-yBwMwLjW4B_AEwgcFMC40LjLIBw8&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp). The IMF and the Bank of England issued warnings that an 'AI bubble' could burst in the next 6-18 months (good video on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzETvTMUx8)).\n\nSo, is AI overvalued? In my humble opinion, yes. Everything points towards it being overvalued. The cash being passed between NVIDIA &gt; Openai&gt; Microsoft &gt; AMD has me worried. I work in advertising—right now, the internet is only extremely profitable because of advertising. Google, Meta, Snapchat, etc are NOT tech companies. They are advertising platforms. These companies need to find a way to monetise AI, and the most profitable way would be to attract advertisers, but no one can seem to figure out how to achieve that.

The story actually starts with policy. CMS (basically the big U.S. healthcare payer) is rethinking its coverage for noninvasive stool-based cancer screening tests. If that decision turns more favorable, it could be a game changer. Why? Because once CMS opens the door, private insurers usually follow to avoid being left with the sicker pool of patients. It also sets the stage for pilot programs with payers and PBMs - the kind of thing that can take a small diagnostic and turn it into a routine order for doctors, especially where colonoscopy appointments are backed up.\n\nOn the commercial side, Switzerland is already live, and that’s where things start to get real. The signals I’m watching aren’t flashy headlines, just execution details - how many samples they’re running month over month, how many clinics have joined, whether turnaround times are dropping, and if any insurers are showing support. The U.K. launch through EDX gives them a clear entry point for first orders, and Germany still contributes quietly through existing lab channels and an insurer-aligned screening program.\n\nThe clinical side might be the most important though, because it defines the U.S. path. Their eAArly DETECT 2 trial in average-risk colorectal cancer is supposed to read out in Q4. That’s the study that sets the tone for a 2026 pivotal. What I care about isn’t just “positive” or “negative” - it’s the details: how sensitive the test is, how well it finds precancer, and whether those numbers will convince payers to actually reimburse it. For the pancreatic test, the early signal looked solid, and now everyone’s waiting to see the start of a larger retrospective study and PCR validation - both critical for scaling into everyday labs.\n\nOwnership updates can also stir the pot.

These sales were conducted under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, mitigating concerns that the sales are based on recent non-public information.\n- **Market Impact**: While a sale of this magnitude from a primary insider could be perceived as bearish, the fact that it was pre-scheduled suggests a planned portfolio adjustment or liquidity event rather than a loss of confidence in the company's future prospects.

A cover is defined on Wikipedia as a new performance or recording by a musician other than the original performer or composer of the song.  Sometimes they aren’t that different from the original, but other times they can be really different. Heck they can even be in [a different language](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion) from the original.  And yes, there are times when the cover becomes [more popular](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp) (and/or critically acclaimed) than the original.\n\nBut where exactly does the line between “covering” and “plagiarism” lie?

He has been a part of my life for so long it's hard to remember what my life was like before he was in it in some capacity. I love him dearly, and I love the life we've built together.\n\nHe doesn't handle his frustration or anger or insecurities well. He has a lot of trust issues (despite the fact that I haven't done anything to merit distrust, which he will acknowledge - his trust issues stem from legitimate childhood trauma) and will frequently presume worst intentions. Sometimes he might see something small and his brain will draw conclusions like \"[Wife] hasn't put the dishes away (even though I never asked it and there are plenty of times I don't put dishes away), therefore she doesn't respect me or prioritize our relationship.\" Frequently in arguments, his feelings will take precedence over my own. I do my very best to listen to his feelings and acknowledge/empathize with them, but in the heat of the moment very frequently my own feelings become things for him to react to rather than listen to - and thus the discussion about his feelings continue while mine never get addressed.\n\nWe've been in couples counseling for years now. Originally it was more of a maintenance thing, but over the past year it has become critically necessary. My husband sunk into a really deep depression last spring, and last summer was honestly pretty hellish for both of us.

The football is too poor, supporters are grumbling, John Heitinga is under fire. Technical director Alex Kroes continues to believe in the coach for now. Time for an extensive conversation with the preacher of realism. ‘I know where we come from.’\n\nAlex Kroes sits relaxed, the Friday before Sparta away (3-3). Open gaze. Talkative. Willing to provide insight into various processes. You wouldn't say that the scapegoat has joined us. The technical director is an independent spirit. Someone who – in his own words – is and always will be an Ajax man. But also someone who does not derive his identity from his current position, or from Ajax at all.\n\nAnd that brings us straight to the biggest prejudice, says Kroes. \"What I sometimes hear is that people think I'm a snob. Or a careerist. The funny thing is: frankly, I couldn't care less about careerism. Before I arrived, I was unfairly hyped up. Then I was torn down when we appointed Francesco Farioli. When he started performing well, I was the best technical director in the Netherlands. Now I'm the worst again. Whatever.\"\n\nHe turned the Sports Entertainment Group into a major player in football and reformed Go Ahead Eagles. Behind the scenes, he was able to rely on his knowledge of economics and business administration. He rarely stepped into the spotlight. From that perspective, Ajax is the other extreme, with almost inhuman pressure and often unrealistic expectations. ‘I literally had to step out of my comfort zone,’ he says of that transformation. ‘Many people don't know this, but I'm more introverted than extroverted. Then I read outsiders' opinions about me and think: you really don't know me.’\n\nKroes takes his time and does not shy away from any subject. He admits that he was initially too gullible. For example, by agreeing to verify or refute certain claims for Menno de Galan's book Ajax in crisis and subsequently providing additional \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV_Anxiety/comments/1o85496/sharing_my_story/\nSubreddit: r/HIV_Anxiety\nTitle: Sharing my story….\nAuthor: u/KeyOperation2825\nScore: 6 | Comments: 2 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 20:42:47\nContent: Hello, I wanted to share my story to those that may find it helpful and hope it reaches someone going through the same:\nI was obsessed with browsing the HIV subreddits in late 2022, I think then it was HIV and HIV News.  I was lost, confused, desperate and angry because I had fucked up.  I put myself in a position where I was at a very high risk of being exposed to HIV.  The realization of what had happened had not hit me the day after and it wasn’t until the following day that I began to panic because I was worried I was exposed and sought to get on PEP asap.  To make this story shorter than it is, I wanted to share what I went through and learned which I hope can be useful to someone here looking for some sort of answers or hope.  I was able to get on PEP on the final hours of the 72 hour window, and prayed it would still be effective.  However, after adhering to the regimen of the medication I still developed a fever right after my last dose.  It was at that point I was convinced PEP had not worked and I had acquired the virus.  I needed to wait the upcoming long months required to be retested however I believed it would only confirm what I had already convinced myself of.  Waiting to retest, it was during this time that I can honestly say was the darkest time in my life as I contemplated suicide or whether life was worth living.  The never ending examinations of my body for blemishes, only to be aggravated by the ongoing night sweats i had never experienced.  At that point I decided I needed to reach out for professional help.  Before  retesting I went through therapy already convinced I was infected and hoping I could at least come to terms with my unavoidable diagnosis.  I actually retested until 6 months later and my results were negative.  Then 3 months later I retested negative once more being unconvinced my prior test was accurate.  Now, 3 years later I have accepted my anxiety played a powerful  role in what I was convinced were symptoms of HIV.

Their entire lives they have always been best friends. My eldest is Sam (17) and the year below is Izzy (16). These girls have been absolutely inseparable since Izzy was born. They'd read each other stories, play with their dolls, do each others hair, held hands EVERYWHERE they went together, and they look incredibly alike too, people have mistaken them for twins when they were younger. We've always had a pretty tight knit family; me, husband and the girls, we have family film/game nights and regularly take trips together. These girls are my entire world and I'm feeling absolutely riddled with guilt over the last two years because I'm really starting to dislike my youngest, Izzy.\n\nObviously they weren't going to stay the same forever, from the age of about 13 onwards was when they both really started to diverge with their personalities. I completely expected and thought I was prepared for this, I can still remember when I first started to feel like I was becoming my own person and I know it's a confusing/emotional rollercoaster for teens, so I try to be as open and understanding as possible in regards to their choices.\n\nBoth girls are currently doing their A-levels in college (UK).\n\nSam is studying Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and some kind of animal welfare subject, her goal is to go into veterinary course at Uni, and she currently volunteers at our local vets \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1o9f4l4/aita_for_taking_away_my_husband_from_my_mil/\nSubreddit: r/dustythunder\nTitle: AITA for “taking away” my husband from my MIL?\nAuthor: u/MotherLilith8589\nScore: 267 | Comments: 365 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 06:25:29\nContent: Hey Dusty!

Relevant information: We’ve known each other since I was 16 and he was 20. I’d met his mom a few times in my 20’s. He was married once before, he has 4 kids from that previous marriage, (we have one of own own, together) I was a bridesmaid in his first wedding and I used to be his babysitter—I know what you’re thinking; RELAX! We did NOT cheat, his ex wife (whom we’ll call Vanessa) cheated numerous times, gave him the same STD twice and was absolutely horrible to my husband’s mom. They were separated for about two years and finalized their divorce a bit before Covid happened. Then we reconnected, started dating, got engaged and got married by the end of the year just before Covid went full blown. \n\nMy mother-in-law has always shown my husband to be her favorite of the two kids that she has. “OOOOOOOOOOOOH I LOVE MY SON!

It will be a VERY LONG ONE though as context is necessary, sorry in advance.\n\nSo for initial context, my (26f) dad (62m) had no idea that my half-brother, Lewis (fake name, early 30s), even existed until I discovered him by pure accident. He didn't abandon him as a child, he just moved away before he knew that Lewis's mother was pregnant and purposefully left no way to be contacted (why he did that is important and I will get to in a minute), so he genuinely had no idea Lewis even existed. \n\nAlso, whilst my dad is a biker through and through (he definitely looks it too), he is amazing and kind and very genuine, and runs a children’s book and toy shop that he owns for a living. Contrasting I know but he is truly amazing and I’m not just saying that because he’s my dad (although I am biased lol). I add this because I know, and my mum agrees, that there is no way he would have abandoned a baby if he knew about him. He would have stayed despite wanting to leave the area and certain things/people behind. That’s important to remember. \n\nI discovered Lewis's existence by pure accident in my last week at my previous job back in March 2025. My old boss, colleagues and I were talking about genealogy and where our ancestors descended from geographically. I remembered that I had years ago signed up to a DNA ancestry website to find out this kind of info as I was intrigued. I hadn't looked at it in years after initially reading the results of where my DNA says I was from across the world and couldn't remember the exact results so logged back in whilst chatting to my co-workers. \n\nMuch to my utter shock I had a notification that I had a DNA match to a half-brother.

The Buccaneers could deserve the top spot, but also played a game too close to a decimated 49ers squad before Baker went full bulldozer on a 3rd and long run. The Colts could deserve the top spot, but a close game to the Cardinals raises some orbital bones. The Lions could deserve a top spot, but after losing to a team who just lost to the *Jaguars*? Cases can be made as easily as they can be refuted, but that's why we all love the NFL. Rankers ranked four different teams at the top in week 6 (Lions, Chiefs, Bucs, Packers), same as week 5. In bottom barrel news, there were also four teams ranked at 32 (Titans, Jets, Bengals, Saints). In most middling news, there were eleven teams ranked at 16 overall.

Like, the Chinese word for \"scroll\" (as in scrolling TikTok)? Many learners don't know it.\n\nSo today I'm going to share a few super-common Chinese words that got totally new meanings (or were just invented) in the social media era.\n\n\n\n**晒 shài** \\- literally means to dry things in the sun (like clothes).\n\nBut on social media it means sharing something, often with a subtle vibe of bragging, so people often use it in a slightly negative way.\n\n* 她每天都在 IG 晒自己做的早餐。Tā měi tiān dōu zài IG shài zì jǐ zuò de zǎo cān.\n* She posts her homemade breakfast on IG every single day.\n* 他表面上是发自拍，其实是在晒新买的手表。Tā biǎo miàn shàng shì fā zì pāi, qí shí shì zài shài xīn mǎi de shǒu biǎo.\n* He's pretending to post a selfie but actually he's just flexing his new watch.\n\n(There's also a theory that using 晒 for showing off comes from the Cantonese phrase 晒命 shài mìng.)\n\n\n\n**刷 shuā** \\- originally means \"brush\".\n\nSince smartphones became a thing, it describes endless scrolling through content. (Just like brushing a wall over and over again, right?) You can say 刷手机 (shuā shǒu jī, scroll on your phone) or mention a specific app. When it comes to live streams, sending virtual gifts to streamers also called 刷礼物 (shuā lǐ wù, sending gifts).\n\n* 我总是在睡前刷小红书，根本停不下来。Wǒ zǒng shì zài shuì qián shuā xiǎohóngshū, gēn běn tíng bù xià lái.\n* I always scroll through rednote before bed and literally can't stop.\n* 你怎么又在给主播刷跑车，太浪费钱了！(Nǐ zěn me yòu zài gěi zhǔ bō shuā pǎo chē, tài làng fèi qián le!)\n* Why are you sending sports car gifts to streamers again? Such a waste of money!\n\n\n\n**推 tuī** \\- means \"push\" and it's part of the word 推荐 (tuī jiàn, to recommend).\n\nWith the rise of news feeds and algorithm, it now describes when platforms push content to you.\n\n* 抖音天天推给我肌肉男，它怎么知道我喜欢？Dǒuyīn tiān tiān tuī gěi wǒ jī ròu nán, tā zěn me zhī d\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6037 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

The story actually starts with policy. CMS (basically the big U.S. healthcare payer) is rethinking its coverage for noninvasive stool-based cancer screening tests. If that decision turns more favorable, it could be a game changer. Why? Because once CMS opens the door, private insurers usually follow to avoid being left with the sicker pool of patients. It also sets the stage for pilot programs with payers and PBMs - the kind of thing that can take a small diagnostic and turn it into a routine order for doctors, especially where colonoscopy appointments are backed up.\n\nOn the commercial side, Switzerland is already live, and that’s where things start to get real. The signals I’m watching aren’t flashy headlines, just execution details - how many samples they’re running month over month, how many clinics have joined, whether turnaround times are dropping, and if any insurers are showing support. The U.K. launch through EDX gives them a clear entry point for first orders, and Germany still contributes quietly through existing lab channels and an insurer-aligned screening program.\n\nThe clinical side might be the most important though, because it defines the U.S. path. Their eAArly DETECT 2 trial in average-risk colorectal cancer is supposed to read out in Q4. That’s the study that sets the tone for a 2026 pivotal.

The sale is planned under a pre-established 10b5-1 trading plan, which mitigates the negative signal typically associated with large insider sales.\n- **Market Impact**: The market may see a neutral to slightly negative reaction. The large size of the sale could attract attention, but its pre-scheduled nature under a 10b5-1 plan often dampens the impact, as it's not seen as a reaction to current events.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | LAM RESEARCH CORP |\n| Ticker Symbol | LRCX |\n| CIK | 0000707549 |\n| Industry | Special Industry Machinery, NEC [3559] |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | Vahedi Vahid |\n| CIK | 0001707826 |\n| Title/Position | Officer |\n| Relationship | Officer |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Form Type | 144 (Notice of Proposed Sale) |\n| Transaction Date | 2025-10-13 (Ap\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6040 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

Their entire lives they have always been best friends. My eldest is Sam (17) and the year below is Izzy (16). These girls have been absolutely inseparable since Izzy was born. They'd read each other stories, play with their dolls, do each others hair, held hands EVERYWHERE they went together, and they look incredibly alike too, people have mistaken them for twins when they were younger. We've always had a pretty tight knit family; me, husband and the girls, we have family film/game nights and regularly take trips together. These girls are my entire world and I'm feeling absolutely riddled with guilt over the last two years because I'm really starting to dislike my youngest, Izzy.\n\nObviously they weren't going to stay the same forever, from the age of about 13 onwards was when they both really started to diverge with their personalities. I completely expected and thought I was prepared for this, I can still remember when I first started to feel like I was becoming my own person and I know it's a confusing/emotional rollercoaster for teens, so I try to be as open and understanding as possible in regards to their choices.\n\nBoth girls are currently doing their A-levels in college (UK).\n\nSam is studying Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and some kind of animal welfare subject, her goal is to go into veterinary course at Uni, and she currently volunteers at our local vets \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1od69dn/one_punch_man_season_3_director_shinpei_nagai/\nSubreddit: r/anime\nTitle: One Punch Man Season 3 Director Shinpei Nagai deletes his twitter account due to the pressure/hate, calls out people/youtubers who took his tweets out of context/exploited the staff's struggles for \"rage-baiting\" and profit.\nAuthor: u/Electrical_Chance991\nScore: 4076 | Comments: 882 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 19:59:39\nContent: His account has been deleted shortly after posting this tweet.\n\n\"Translated by Grok Show original\n\nUm, I have some rather unfortunate news.

Carter and Knight both averaged just 2.8 yards per carry, but found the end zone. Demercado had the big run of the day of 72 yards but soured it by letting go of the ball just before crossing the goal line, untouched, which would've but the Cardinals up 28-6 with 12:51 remaining in the 4th quarter. They would go on to lose 22-21. This is important because it's hard to imagine Demercado's usage increases as a result of this potentially season-altering mistake. Arizona is now 2-3 instead of 3-2 and heading to face a tough Colts defense in Indianapolis in Week 6. Carter is a volume-based, low-end RB2 in this matchup.

The story actually starts with policy. CMS (basically the big U.S. healthcare payer) is rethinking its coverage for noninvasive stool-based cancer screening tests. If that decision turns more favorable, it could be a game changer. Why? Because once CMS opens the door, private insurers usually follow to avoid being left with the sicker pool of patients. It also sets the stage for pilot programs with payers and PBMs - the kind of thing that can take a small diagnostic and turn it into a routine order for doctors, especially where colonoscopy appointments are backed up.\n\nOn the commercial side, Switzerland is already live, and that’s where things start to get real. The signals I’m watching aren’t flashy headlines, just execution details - how many samples they’re running month over month, how many clinics have joined, whether turnaround times are dropping, and if any insurers are showing support. The U.K. launch through EDX gives them a clear entry point for first orders, and Germany still contributes quietly through existing lab channels and an insurer-aligned screening program.\n\nThe clinical side might be the most important though, because it defines the U.S. path. Their eAArly DETECT 2 trial in average-risk colorectal cancer is supposed to read out in Q4. That’s the study that sets the tone for a 2026 pivotal. What I care about isn’t just “positive” or “negative” - it’s the details: how sensitive the test is, how well it finds precancer, and whether those numbers will convince payers to actually reimburse it. For the pancreatic test, the early signal looked solid, and now everyone’s waiting to see the start of a larger retrospective study and PCR validation - both critical for scaling into everyday labs.\n\nOwnership updates can also stir the pot. Keep an eye out for 13G filings from funds like Armistice, or new distributio\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6041 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

(CRWD)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: Medium\n- **Key Takeaway**: The President of CrowdStrike, Michael Sentonas, executed a large, multi-part sale of company stock totaling over $12.7 million. The transaction's significance is tempered by the fact that it was conducted under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, indicating it was planned in advance and not necessarily a reaction to current events.\n- **Market Impact**: The market reaction is expected to be neutral to slightly negative. While the headline value is large, sophisticated investors will recognize the mitigating context of the 10b5-1 plan. The insider's remaining substantial holding provides a strong counterbalance.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. |\n| Ticker Symbol | CRWD |\n| CIK | 0001535527 |\n| Industry | SERVICES-PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE [7372] |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | Sentonas Michael |\n| CIK | 0001968270 |\n| Title/Position | PRESIDENT |\n| Relationship | Officer |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\nThis filing \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6037 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

He was very successful and left behind money and assets. He also had a Will. My brother was also in a gay relationship for 8 years with a 28M partner. Our family is religious and yes we may not have approved the relationship we still loved our brother. He unfortunately died of cancer and left a will. Left most of the money to his gay partner. They weren't even married. We decided money to be kept within the family and but gave his partner some money. We also paid for brothers funeral and medical Bill's. We thought that was the end of it. But now his ex partner is suing us for the rest of the funds. I don't know how he got hold of the will. My family is still grieving and now this man wants to take us to court.

Nevertheless, in order to move forward with this, you have to understand what Clover Assistance is and why it is a big deal.\n\nClover assistant is an AI-driven clinical decision support tool developed by Clover Health. It’s a platform designed for doctors and clinicians to use during patient visits. It gives real-time clinical recommendations to primary care providers, especially for Medicare Advantage and previously ACO REACH populations. The best way to think about it is that it is an EHR system built to support the AI system that is able to surface key medical info, flag care gaps, optimize risk coding by identifying chronic conditions that should be documented to ensure accurate reimbursement from Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and feeds data back to Clover Health to help improve risk adjustment and quality reporting.\n\nThe way it work is CA pulls real-time clinical and claims data on the patient during a visit. The doctor confirms or dismisses the suggestions. Clover captures the structured data, which helps to improve care quality, reduce avoidable hospitalizations, and increase reimbursement accuracy through more complete coding. This is how it can achieve the top HEDIS score while having average customer service. I have my thoughts on this, but we're not going to go into it here. As a side note, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a standardized performance measurement system used by most U.S. health plans. A high HEDIS score means that the plan or provider has met or exceeded specific process and outcome benchmarks. It reflects an assertive preventative care outreach, good care coordination, effective reporting infrastructure, and higher patient engagement.\n\nFor Clover Health, it attributes its strong real-world health outcomes to the use of CA.\n\nWith that said, 2025 \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1o89aj9/did_a_robot_write_this_post_for_irish_magazine/\nSubreddit: r/AskIreland\nTitle: Did a robot write this post for Irish magazine?\nAuthor: u/LostForeverSoFar\nScore: 5 | Comments: 15 | Upvote Ratio: 78.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 23:30:59\nContent: Maybe you don’t care but I was a little disappointed to see a ‘prominent’ magazine focused on running and produced in Ireland post the below on Facebook to announce the national half marathon location for 2026. \n\nI called it out.

Many a R&amp;A member and fellow cleaner noticed him grumbling something as he walked by them, something about the organisation’s resident cheerful, vengeful spirit. In fact, when a lieutenant of Squadron 13 from the Relief Force informed him of Tsuru’s request to clean both her and the lieutenant’s office while she was away on an assignment, he was seen visibly gritting his teeth and forced an appropriate, formal response of acknowledgement. Then he begrudgingly left to complete her request.*\n\n*Stanley was a man from a rural community, named Steyl-river, after a nearby river, on the fringe territories of the Council Lands. In those areas, support from the council is little if anything, thus they were practically fending for themselves against natural and man-made threats. De facto city-states and de facto frontier towns. In those communities, one can foster a tribalistic or theocratic worldview and values, most of which are negative towards the council, foreigners and magic-users in general. Stanley, himself, tried to distance himself from many of those views and values at a young age as his parents encouraged him to be an independent thinker and to be his own person; thus, he adopted a pro-council sentiment, to the disappointment of his community. Though he did share in their great distrust of foreigners, in his mind, the more foreign the person, the more trouble they are or cause. Anything from minor disagreements, to language and cultural barriers, to actual issues like terrorism, foreign occupation and et cetera, in Stanley’s mind, all of those are local problems related to foreigners. And Tsuru was the most foreign person he had met.*\n\n*She spoke a language so foreign that he had no way to discern any meaning or even basic concepts from her words and sentences.

What should I do?**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!emotional abuse and manipulation, past childhood trauma, insecurity, depression, verbal abuse, property damage, anger issues!&lt;\n\n-----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/PiMnV7yoZA): **February 20, 2018**\n\nI've been married to a smart, sexy, witty, wonderful man for 5 years, dated him for 6 years prior to that, and known him as a friend for 5 years before that. He has been a part of my life for so long it's hard to remember what my life was like before he was in it in some capacity. I love him dearly, and I love the life we've built together.\n\nHe doesn't handle his frustration or anger or insecurities well. He has a lot of trust issues (despite the fact that I haven't done anything to merit distrust, which he will acknowledge - his trust issues stem from legitimate childhood trauma) and will frequently presume worst intentions. Sometimes he might see something small and his brain will draw conclusions like \"[Wife] hasn't put the dishes away (even though I never asked it and there are plenty of times I don't put dishes away), therefore she doesn't respect me or prioritize our relationship.\" Frequently in arguments, his feelings will take precedence over my own. I do my very best to listen to his feelings and acknowledge/empathize with them, but in the heat of the moment very frequently my own feelings become things for him to react to rather than listen to - and thus the discussion about his feelings continue while mine never get addressed.\n\nWe've been in couples counseling for years now.

The story actually starts with policy. CMS (basically the big U.S. healthcare payer) is rethinking its coverage for noninvasive stool-based cancer screening tests. If that decision turns more favorable, it could be a game changer. Why? Because once CMS opens the door, private insurers usually follow to avoid being left with the sicker pool of patients. It also sets the stage for pilot programs with payers and PBMs - the kind of thing that can take a small diagnostic and turn it into a routine order for doctors, especially where colonoscopy appointments are backed up.\n\nOn the commercial side, Switzerland is already live, and that’s where things start to get real. The signals I’m watching aren’t flashy headlines, just execution details - how many samples they’re running month over month, how many clinics have joined, whether turnaround times are dropping, and if any insurers are showing support. The U.K. launch through EDX gives them a clear entry point for first orders, and Germany still contributes quietly through existing lab channels and an insurer-aligned screening program.\n\nThe clinical side might be the most important though, because it defines the U.S. path. Their eAArly DETECT 2 trial in average-risk colorectal cancer is supposed to read out in Q4. That’s the study that sets the tone for a 2026 pivotal. What I care about isn’t just “positive” or “negative” - it’s the details: how sensitive the test is, how well it finds precancer, and whether those numbers will convince payers to actually reimburse it. For the pancreatic test, the early signal looked solid, and now everyone’s waiting to see the start of a larger retrospective study and PCR validation - both critical for scaling into everyday labs.\n\nOwnership updates can also stir the pot. Keep an eye out for 13G filings from funds like Armistice, or new distributio\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6046 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

The market may see this as a planned liquidity event or portfolio diversification rather than a reaction to near-term company prospects.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | Airbnb, Inc. |\n| Ticker Symbol | ABNB |\n| CIK | 0001559720 |\n| Industry | Services-To Dwellings &amp; Other Buildings |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | Gebbia Joseph |\n| CIK | 0001834171 |\n| Title/Position | null |\n| Relationship | Director, 10% Owner |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\nThis filing reports two separate sale transactions executed on the same day.\n\n| Field | Value (Transaction 1\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6045 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago. He was very successful and left behind money and assets. He also had a Will. My brother was also in a gay relationship for 8 years with a 28M partner. Our family is religious and yes we may not have approved the relationship we still loved our brother. He unfortunately died of cancer and left a will. Left most of the money to his gay partner. They weren't even married. We decided money to be kept within the family and but gave his partner some money. We also paid for brothers funeral and medical Bill's. We thought that was the end of it. But now his ex partner is suing us for the rest of the funds. I don't know how he got hold of the will. My family is still grieving and now this man wants to take us to court.

The story actually starts with policy. CMS (basically the big U.S. healthcare payer) is rethinking its coverage for noninvasive stool-based cancer screening tests. If that decision turns more favorable, it could be a game changer. Why? Because once CMS opens the door, private insurers usually follow to avoid being left with the sicker pool of patients. It also sets the stage for pilot programs with payers and PBMs - the kind of thing that can take a small diagnostic and turn it into a routine order for doctors, especially where colonoscopy appointments are backed up.\n\nOn the commercial side, Switzerland is already live, and that’s where things start to get real. The signals I’m watching aren’t flashy headlines, just execution details - how many samples they’re running month over month, how many clinics have joined, whether turnaround times are dropping, and if any insurers are showing support. The U.K. launch through EDX gives them a clear entry point for first orders, and Germany still contributes quietly through existing lab channels and an insurer-aligned screening program.\n\nThe clinical side might be the most important though, because it defines the U.S. path. Their eAArly DETECT 2 trial in average-risk colorectal cancer is supposed to read out in Q4. That’s the study that sets the tone for a 2026 pivotal. What I care about isn’t just “positive” or “negative” - it’s the details: how sensitive the test is, how well it finds precancer, and whether those numbers will convince payers to actually reimburse it. For the pancreatic test, the early signal looked solid, and now everyone’s waiting to see the start of a larger retrospective study and PCR validation - both critical for scaling into everyday labs.\n\nOwnership updates can also stir the pot. Keep an eye out for 13G filings from funds like Armistice, or new distributio\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SECWatch/comments/1o6ebnp/once_capitals_q3_holdings_451m_portfolio_bets_big/\nSubreddit: r/SECWatch\nTitle: Once Capital's Q3 Holdings: $451M Portfolio Bets Big on Tech &amp; Options\nAuthor: u/Educational_Cup9809\nScore: 1 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 20:37:10\nContent: **SEC EDGAR FILING ALERT**\n\n## Company Information\n- **Company:** **Once Capital Management, LLC**\n- **Form Type:** 13F-HR\n- **Filing Date:** 10/14/2025\n- **Trading Significance:** **HIGH SIGNIFICANCE** - Major market impact potential!\n\n## Insider Details\n- **Name:** Once Capital Management, LLC\n- **Title:** Investment Manager\n- **Relationship:** N/A\n\n## Transaction Details\n- **Transaction Type:** N/A\n- **Security Type:** Common Stock\n- **Shares Transacted:** N/A\n- **Price per Share:** N/A\n- **Total Value:** N/A\n- **Shares Owned After:** N/A\n- **Acquisition/Disposition:** N/A\n\n## Market Context\nThis SEC EDGAR filing provides transparency into insider sentiment and trading activity.

Their entire lives they have always been best friends. My eldest is Sam (17) and the year below is Izzy (16). These girls have been absolutely inseparable since Izzy was born. They'd read each other stories, play with their dolls, do each others hair, held hands EVERYWHERE they went together, and they look incredibly alike too, people have mistaken them for twins when they were younger. We've always had a pretty tight knit family; me, husband and the girls, we have family film/game nights and regularly take trips together. These girls are my entire world and I'm feeling absolutely riddled with guilt over the last two years because I'm really starting to dislike my youngest, Izzy.\n\nObviously they weren't going to stay the same forever, from the age of about 13 onwards was when they both really started to diverge with their personalities. I completely expected and thought I was prepared for this, I can still remember when I first started to feel like I was becoming my own person and I know it's a confusing/emotional rollercoaster for teens, so I try to be as open and understanding as possible in regards to their choices.\n\nBoth girls are currently doing their A-levels in college (UK).\n\nSam is studying Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and some kind of animal welfare subject, her goal is to go into veterinary course at Uni, and she currently volunteers at our local vets \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1od69dn/one_punch_man_season_3_director_shinpei_nagai/\nSubreddit: r/anime\nTitle: One Punch Man Season 3 Director Shinpei Nagai deletes his twitter account due to the pressure/hate, calls out people/youtubers who took his tweets out of context/exploited the staff's struggles for \"rage-baiting\" and profit.\nAuthor: u/Electrical_Chance991\nScore: 4081 | Comments: 882 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 19:59:39\nContent: His account has been deleted shortly after posting this tweet.\n\n\"Translated by Grok Show original\n\nUm, I have some rather unfortunate news.

He has been a part of my life for so long it's hard to remember what my life was like before he was in it in some capacity. I love him dearly, and I love the life we've built together.\n\nHe doesn't handle his frustration or anger or insecurities well. He has a lot of trust issues (despite the fact that I haven't done anything to merit distrust, which he will acknowledge - his trust issues stem from legitimate childhood trauma) and will frequently presume worst intentions. Sometimes he might see something small and his brain will draw conclusions like \"[Wife] hasn't put the dishes away (even though I never asked it and there are plenty of times I don't put dishes away), therefore she doesn't respect me or prioritize our relationship.\" Frequently in arguments, his feelings will take precedence over my own. I do my very best to listen to his feelings and acknowledge/empathize with them, but in the heat of the moment very frequently my own feelings become things for him to react to rather than listen to - and thus the discussion about his feelings continue while mine never get addressed.\n\nWe've been in couples counseling for years now. Originally it was more of a maintenance thing, but over the past year it has become critically necessary. My husband sunk into a really deep depression last spring, and last summer was honestly pretty hellish for both of us.

To the mod team, do consider keeping this thread up to help spread awareness of such events happening.\n\nSome of you may already be aware of the start of what’s now known as the “Collexicon Saga.” To be clear, this post reflects my personal perspective based on publicly available information and conversations with vendors. I may not have the full picture, but I’ll share what I’ve observed so far.\n\n⸻\n\n🗓️ Repetitive Tradeshows\n\nFrom what I’ve gathered, Collexicon has been organising an unusually high number of tradeshows during the current hype of this hobby. Based on their own social media highlights, they’ve held six shows in just six months (Apr–Oct 2025):\n\t•\t19 April (1.0)\n\t•\t23 May (2.0)\n\t•\t26 July (3.0)\n\t•\t30 August (3.5)\n\t•\t13 September (4.0)\n\t•\t4 October (4.5, with Randamu)\n\nThat’s six events in half a year — and more are lined up:\n\t•\t18 October\n\t•\t30 Oct–2 Nov (clashing with Majulah Card Fest @RWS and SCCS @Suntec)\n\t•\t1–2 November (Sudden addition of show after the “saga”\n\t•\t8–9 November\n\t•\t22–23 November (Card Connect @SAFRA Yishun)\n\nAt this point, even vendors seem confused by the rapid and overlapping scheduling. The most concerning changes were the sudden date shifts that caused clashes with other organisers:\n\t•\t8–9 November → overlaps with TheSG TCG TradeFair @GRID\n\nThese last-minute changes put vendors in a difficult position, having to withdraw from one event or another, leaving organisers scrambling to fill gaps. Despite that, Collexicon’s team reportedly reassured vendors that their venue and footfall would “outperform” others, a stance that feels dismissive of the wider community’s ecosystem.\n\n⸻\n\n📊 Polling for Weekly Tradeshows\n\nAt one point, Collexicon reportedly ran a poll in their vendor chat about holding weekly tradeshows (4 weeks, 4 shows).\nThe response from vendors was largely negative, many cited burnout, pe\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6043 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

It illustrates, Snyder says, not only the shortcomings of EY’s report, but how consultants can dazzle policymakers with arcane modelling and data in order to advance the causes of their paymasters.\nData washing is a practice whereby vested interests engage consultants to produce allegedly independent technical analysis and thereby provide “a veil of credibility, which they exploit to lobby parliamentarians and the broader public, distorting the framing of policy debates,” Snyder says.\n“The material produced by these big consultancy firms is often widely accepted as fact, reported as fact, you know, referenced by politicians, media, et cetera,” she says.\nThe more complex the issue, the more susceptible it is, for very few people have the time or capacity to re-examine the findings. And no issue is more complex than dealing with climate change.\nThe EY report was prepared for AEP two years ago, to provide what the oil and gas industry peak body called “an independent assessment of the future role of natural gas in Australia and the region”.

The transaction is scheduled under a pre-established 10b5-1 trading plan, suggesting it is a planned liquidity event rather than a reaction to immediate company news.\n- **Market Impact**: The market impact is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. While insider sales can be perceived as bearish, the fact that this sale is part of a 10b5-1 plan adopted nearly a year prior mitigates much of the negative sentiment. The consistent selling pattern may already be priced in by the market.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | Datadog, Inc. |\n| Ticker Symbol | DDOG (Note: Not in filing, added for context) |\n| CIK | 0001561550 |\n| Industry | Services-Prepackaged Software |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | Michael J Callahan |\n| CIK | 0001784030 |\n| Title/Position | Director |\n| Relationship | Director |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6047 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is thought to be caused by repeated hits to the head causing a type of cortical neurodegeneration (tauopathy) similar to dementia.  We joke about certain hits inflicting CTE, or see the results in a slurring punch drunk athlete a few years before their \"early\" demise.  Will Smith even [made a movie about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion_(2015_film)).  \n\nUnfortunately, CTE is mostly a myth that is largely indistinguishable from any other tauopathy (and invisible without a very high level autopsy).  Just as bad, the assumed cognitive changes are disconnected in common thought from where the real cognitive harm occurs, which is the white matter and brainstem.  What's happening isn't cortical but brainstem damage, which imparts all of the common symptoms including dizziness, visual motion sensitivity, imbalance, headache, brain fog, autonomic swings, and difficulty stabilizing attention.  We can even predict how severe the effects of CTE will be, not by cortical insult, but by severity of lesions to the brainstem.  \n\nThis isn't even a CTE thing, for ALL TBIs, brainstem insults impart several times the risk for negative outcomes than any other commonly measured metric.  Severe brainstem injuries impart progressive cognitive decline and measurable \"IQ\" decline, reduction to executive function, and impulse control.  The Glasgow scales all show that cognitive outcomes are more highly coupled to brainstem injury than any other factor.  More specificly, insults to the pons almost completely account for CTE symptoms.  \n\nOne of the biggest issues with our understanding of CTE is that it's a highly over selected base pool, we draw from individuals who are symptomatic and largely discard all of the asymptomatic cases.  There is a similar but improving issue with dementia diagnosis.  Because of this both conditions \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6034 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

I am far from fluent in Chinese or Korean so I often relied on less than reliable automatic translations. Therefore, I couldn’t make as complete or accurate of a writeup as possible. Feel free to let me know of any details I may have glossed over. Also the main drama happened 20 years ago, so many online sources on that have likely disappeared.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nOne thing that is common in music is covers.  A cover is defined on Wikipedia as a new performance or recording by a musician other than the original performer or composer of the song.  Sometimes they aren’t that different from the original, but other times they can be really different. Heck they can even be in [a different language](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion) from the original.  And yes, there are times when the cover becomes [more popular](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp) (and/or critically acclaimed) than the original.\n\nBut where exactly does the line between “covering” and “plagiarism” lie?  Well one singer based in Taiwan got many fans of Asian pop music asking that question in the mid 2000s.\n\n**Free Style(프리스타일) - Y (Please Tell Me Why)**\n\nNote: Information on the group Free Style is hard to find in English so I had to use Google Translate and my limited knowledge of Korean for my research.  Also, I asked a few people on r/kpophelp for information about them.\n\nThe story of the drama starts in South Korea, which is the home country of the hip-hop group Free Style (프리스타일) (yes that is the group’s actual name).  Free Style debuted in 1999 and consists of brothers Mino (real name Choi Min-ho; not the SHINee member) and DJ Zio (real name: Choi Ji-ho) as well as a female singer named Lazy.\n\nIn the first few years of their career, the group struggled with a lack of success and after 2 albums, Lazy left the gr\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o6n0ut/reading_through_this_sub_after_the_first_weekend/\nSubreddit: r/Battlefield6\nTitle: Reading through this sub after the first Weekend....\nAuthor: u/Treigns4\nScore: 34 | Comments: 33 | Upvote Ratio: 72.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 02:08:02\nContent: Body text (optional)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ocy9go/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: (MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money\nAuthor: u/Direct-Caterpillar77\nScore: 6041 | Comments: 1632 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:02:02\nContent: **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throawaylatechild**\n\n**(MA) late brother's partner suing family for Money**\n\n**Originally posted to r/legaladvice**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!homophobia, theft, loss of a loved one, mentions death threats!&lt;\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** &gt;!Outrageous!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809220052/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95c289/ma_late_brothers_partner_suing_family_for_money/)  **Aug 7, 2018**\n\nOur brother age 34M died of cancer 9 months ago.

He has been a part of my life for so long it's hard to remember what my life was like before he was in it in some capacity. I love him dearly, and I love the life we've built together.\n\nHe doesn't handle his frustration or anger or insecurities well. He has a lot of trust issues (despite the fact that I haven't done anything to merit distrust, which he will acknowledge - his trust issues stem from legitimate childhood trauma) and will frequently presume worst intentions. Sometimes he might see something small and his brain will draw conclusions like \"[Wife] hasn't put the dishes away (even though I never asked it and there are plenty of times I don't put dishes away), therefore she doesn't respect me or prioritize our relationship.\" Frequently in arguments, his feelings will take precedence over my own. I do my very best to listen to his feelings and acknowledge/empathize with them, but in the heat of the moment very frequently my own feelings become things for him to react to rather than listen to - and thus the discussion about his feelings continue while mine never get addressed.\n\nWe've been in couples counseling for years now. Originally it was more of a maintenance thing, but over the past year it has become critically necessary. My husband sunk into a really deep depression last spring, and last summer was honestly pretty hellish for both of us.

Evidence spans years from r/SuperStonk, historical cases, regulatory filings, and recent developments. Laws broken are specified in each section, with predicate acts tied to RICO.

The fact that cheese exists means the game/devs/studio is bad. Long-term players will be familiar with most of them; Pace &amp; Acceleration is all you need to win. The custom corner setup to bag your 19 Jumping Reach CB thirty goals a season. Long Throws launched into a certain combo of player positions. 4231 Gegenpress all game, every game. Downloadable tactics that break the match engine.\n\nIf any combination of these is making you annoyed that the game can be exploited for easy success then, just a thought: maybe don't use them?\n\nThere's a difference between 'game exploit' and 'only way to win'. Buying fast, massive lads with crap technical or mental skills will get you somewhere, but so will having a mix of good athletes, technical wizards and mentally strong heroes. You can win games without needing a corner goal every 60 minutes. Tactics other than 4231 work. It'll be harder to blitz from the Vanarama South to the Premier League in 6 seasons, but success is still very possible.\n\nMost games have some level of exploit in the mechanics; there are communites, YT channels and gaming news articles dedicated to finding and having fun with them. Skyrim, basically any Paradox game, Mario 64, the Konami Code etc. But game design is about giving players a series of mechanics to allow them to succeed without *needing* to find an exact optimal setup. FM still has that base quality, even among the specific problems that have been there for years.\n\nYes, it's frustrating that certain gameplay issues have persisted over multiple generations of FM.

It's an easy to use tool that helps you navigate tons of different usage, efficiency, DVOA, and more numbers by team, position, and more.\n\n**32 Facts for 32 Teams After Week 5**\n\n**Arizona Cardinals**\n\n\\- *RB Michael Carter led the Cardinals' backfield with 57.6% of offensive snaps played*\n\nCarter's 18 rush attempts were also 11 more than Emari Demercado (4) and Bam Knight (3) *combined*. Carter and Knight both averaged just 2.8 yards per carry, but found the end zone. Demercado had the big run of the day of 72 yards but soured it by letting go of the ball just before crossing the goal line, untouched, which would've but the Cardinals up 28-6 with 12:51 remaining in the 4th quarter. They would go on to lose 22-21. This is important because it's hard to imagine Demercado's usage increases as a result of this potentially season-altering mistake. Arizona is now 2-3 instead of 3-2 and heading to face a tough Colts defense in Indianapolis in Week 6. Carter is a volume-based, low-end RB2 in this matchup. The floor is sub-10 PPR points but if you added him in the first place, you're likely in a position where you need to start him.\n\n**Atlanta Falcons**\n\n\\- *TE Kyle Pitts has a 17.5% target share this season*\n\nThe Falcons exit their Week 5 bye to host the Bills in Week 6.

I met this guy, well call him A, at the party and was introduced to him and his girlfriend, well call her Y. I WAS INTRODUCED TO BOTH OF THEM AS HER (Z) FRIEND. This is important for later. \n\nLong story short, me and A became really good friends (semi-friends with Y) and all of us hung out a lot with MY fiancé, call him B, at the time. Things happened in both relationships and A/Y broke up and I broke up with B. Z THEN tells me they were poly and in a three-way semi relationship, but she didn't want a relationship defined with A. THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT. \n\nMe and A ended up becoming closer after both our breakups (A breakup happened first them mine) and due to a bad situation eith my housing and mental health state, I ended up staying at A's house. Things developed and we coughed feelings for each other. A and me BOTH asked Z if she was okay with us messing around with each other, but not forming a relationship and she said \"yeah that's fine\" and encouraged it. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. \n\nOur relationship developed and Z started being distant towards me and A both and then stopped contacting me completely. Hangouts would be with A and Z alone and sometimes would be the three of us together. A never gave attention to either of us when we were together, or if he did, he focused on Z mostly. \n\nI started getting negative feelings and felt left out by both my friends, A and Z, and discussed my feelings in an open conversation with them both. Mind you, A would talk about Z while actively having sex with me and while she wasn't around. After our talk, it became minimal, but he still would speak of her and the three of us together. A claimed he loves both\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oag07q/me_45f_with_my_daughters17f_16f_i_like_one_more/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: Me [45F] with my daughters[17F &amp; 16F].

This isn't just a fleeting disappointment; for many, it's a recurring, deeply frustrating experience that can erode confidence and strain relationships. This is premature ejaculation (PE), a common male sexual dysfunction characterized by a short ejaculatory latency, a perceived lack of control, and associated negative personal consequences. The good news is that managing PE isn't about magical fixes, but rather about learning practical, evidence-based techniques to regain control and enhance your sexual well-being.\n\nPremature ejaculation is more common than many realize. Fortunately, current medical evidence supports a range of mindfulness-based interventions and behavioral strategies designed to help extend ejaculatory latency and improve ejaculatory control. These approaches are often recommended in clinical settings for holistic patient care.\n\n# Harnessing the Power of Mindfulness\n\nMindfulness involves focusing on the present moment without judgment, which helps reduce performance anxiety and overstimulation during sexual activity. Studies indicate that mindfulness-based interventions can significantly improve intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) and sexual satisfaction by decreasing anxiety and hyperarousal [researchgate.net](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGGDYXP5lZ0g0s2LcjdCf4kB2cImZfyAn96dMkkyNGqx955TDRN9paPF0fA5Qk51gz2i2O63Z_ViKAfbWJM-2sNznOSdrY8g_4IxfjwhBWkq_ougZPknHiBvXSuv5JJqnvmzGeSmJFrprdVcClyZ7jaNRQACP0Vt9vhLDGa26GRggOWRjlthAKnrW1ExKOw0AV2It9Htlf3).

I am far from fluent in Chinese or Korean so I often relied on less than reliable automatic translations. Therefore, I couldn’t make as complete or accurate of a writeup as possible. Feel free to let me know of any details I may have glossed over. Also the main drama happened 20 years ago, so many online sources on that have likely disappeared.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nOne thing that is common in music is covers.  A cover is defined on Wikipedia as a new performance or recording by a musician other than the original performer or composer of the song.  Sometimes they aren’t that different from the original, but other times they can be really different. Heck they can even be in [a different language](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion) from the original.  And yes, there are times when the cover becomes [more popular](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp) (and/or critically acclaimed) than the original.\n\nBut where exactly does the line between “covering” and “plagiarism” lie?  Well one singer based in Taiwan got many fans of Asian pop music asking that question in the mid 2000s.\n\n**Free Style(프리스타일) - Y (Please Tell Me Why)**\n\nNote: Information on the group Free Style is hard to find in English so I had to use Google Translate and my limited knowledge of Korean for my research.  Also, I asked a few people on r/kpophelp for information about them.\n\nThe story of the drama starts in South Korea, which is the home country of the hip-hop group Free Style (프리스타일) (yes that is the group’s actual name).  Free Style debuted in 1999 and consists of brothers Mino (real name Choi Min-ho; not the SHINee member) and DJ Zio (real name: Choi Ji-ho) as well as a female singer named Lazy.\n\nIn the first few years of their career, the group struggled with a lack of success and after 2 albums, Lazy left the gr\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/predprey/comments/1ob3gu5/fang_cottontail_space_grass/\nSubreddit: r/predprey\nTitle: Fang &amp; Cottontail | 'Space Grass'\nAuthor: u/Demon_Lord_Lucifer\nScore: 59 | Comments: 11 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-20 06:42:47\nContent: &gt;Haya Lovely animals!

Aside from the top 6 or so teams, the rest of the league would struggle to even get 20 points in the English league in a season. Whilst Gyökeres scored a lot of goals last season, most of them came against the bottom 10 teams, and a lot of them were penalty goals (12). The point I'm making is his numbers last season were a little inflated, don't put too much pressure on him, he'll give you 30 or so goals in a good season.\n\nGyökeres thrived in transitional situations; his favourite type of goal was to cut in from the left-hand side and shoot during a counterattack. Conversely, his influence in game when we had a lot of possession was relatively low, he was really poor in the air for someone so huge, and lacked the technical ability to create chances for himself in the box.\n\nNow, the good news is he is still clearly adapting to the league. It may take some time, but I am sure he'll find a way to start scoring goals regularly. And aside from scoring, he regularly takes both center backs out of the game, creating more space for his teammates. Another thing is you guys aren't creating enough chances for him, you guys probably aren't used to playing with a proper 9, only Martin Ødegaard was looking to supply him regularly, Gyökeres needs service.\n\nEven if he doesn't start delivering this season, us Sporting fans have no doubt he'll turn into a prolific striker, we saw what he was capable of in Portugal. All the best regarding your season, and good luck to Gyökeres!\n\nEdit - How are some of you guys so negative in the comments? He's only been with you guys for 2 months and so many people are already writing him off, support your club and every single playe\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1oag07q/me_45f_with_my_daughters17f_16f_i_like_one_more/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: Me [45F] with my daughters[17F &amp; 16F].

As a result, the American invasion of Canada in 1812 was a success, and it led Britain to fight a mostly defensive war in an attempt to avoid losing Canada. (Means the burning of Washington and the siege of Fort McHenry never happened.)\n\nWith loyalists in Canada fleeing back to Britain, the war being unpopular back home, and with Napoleon returning from exile, the British were forced to sign a treaty with the Americans, surrendering the remainder of British North America (Canada, Rupert’s Land, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward's Island). \n\nAnd with that, the United States of America has doubled its size (again).

After being out of stock for awhile it randomly appeared on their website, so I placed my order. I should have known it was too good to be true. Upon receiving the order, I noticed that underneath the layer of orange Disney Halloween tape used to seal the box there was also a layer of duct tape that had clearly been cut at some point.\n\nUpon opening the box I was very disappointed to find that the doll had clearly been removed from the packaging and was left shaking around. It became very clear that this was a returned item. I don’t understand how Disney would be okay shipping a $170 item (with shipping) in this condition.\n\nAnyhow, I reached out to customer service and they said they would need to conduct an investigation on their end. After about a week, they reached back out claiming that they had evidence UPS had tampered with the package and that I should reach out to UPS to resolve the matter. Furthermore, they also encouraged me to try filing a chargeback through my credit card company. What kind of advice is that from a retailer?\n\nThere’s been a lot of back and forth and I’m no more closer to reaching a resolution. I had a similar experience with one of the artist statues, but at the time I thought it might have been damaged in shipping. It’s now clear to me that Disney is shipping returns regardless of condition and does not care to rectify the matter, so just sharing my experience so others can avoid ending up in the same situation. Just another instance of Disney not giving a shit about their customers.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/sofistock/comments/1o8qcoo/why_i_believe_sofi_technologies_fair_value_is_50/\nSubreddit: r/sofistock\nTitle: Why i believe SoFi Technologies' fair value is $50\nAuthor: u/KittieNipps\nScore: 194 | Comments: 44 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 11:08:42\nContent: SoFi has gone from a student‐loan refi startup in 2011 to a bleeding-edge full-stack, industry-disrupting, asset-light, rapidly-scaled, one-stop-shop financial business and they have started the execution of pivot quite nicely over the last few years. In 2024 the company delivered its first full-year GAAP profit (\\~$499M net income) after several somewhat profitable quarters, validating that this business model, while conservative, can scale after the fintech boom that took place around the late twentyteens to the early 2020's.

Total members jumped from 7.5 million in Q4 2023 to about 10.1 million by Q4 2024, a 34% increase. In Q1 2025 alone SoFi added another 800,000 new members and keeping SoFi benefits free if you keep deposit minimums is one of the best ways to retain users, and these users will remain active by being given a high apr for checking and savings accounts, generous refi credits on mortgages, competitive student loan refis, early payday benefits, free ATM withdrawals, handsome personal loan rates compared to other non-credit union banks, and products that integrate pretty well. For example, SoFi has a relay feature that tracks spending and budgeting based on transactions, making rocket money tools rudimentary; you have to integrate at least 1 bank account to even use this feature or input them manually which no one will do.

I am still working out the bones of my campaign, but I thought it was important to let you all know what I am running on first and foremost.\n\n[In the comments below, I list a few reasons why I and others want DelBene to be replaced.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redmond/comments/1o8lliw/comment/njvrfak/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) I didn’t think it fit the campaign platform itself, which is why I note it separately.  \n\nIn the coming days, I plan on hosting my first campaign event, connecting with voters and better understanding how to bring this campaign to victory. Regarding that specifically, I am looking into reserving the Crossroads Mall’s Community Room. **If any of you would prefer any specific days of the week and times for me to host the event, reply below in the comments!** (Obviously, I want to make sure I have a sizable amount of time to flyer out for the event, as well as reserve the room within 10 days advance notice, as per their sign-up form.)  \n\nAs always, I welcome any questions or comments regarding my platform in the comments below or via email at [huntergordonforwa1@gmail.com](mailto:huntergordonforwa1@gmail.com), and thank you for considering me for the US House! \n\nWant to help with the campaign or be informed of updates?
