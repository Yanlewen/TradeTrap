I will proceed with the Reddit search results.\n\n**AAPL Analysis:**\n*   One Reddit post from r/investing suggests that \"AAPL stock is really a BUY?\" but then states \"at its current valuation, how can anyone take its stock seriously. ... it is way, way overvalued.\" The post also mentions a \"market cap touching $4 trillion\". This indicates a sentiment that AAPL is overvalued and likely to fall.\n\n**GOOG Analysis:**\n*   One Reddit post from r/wallstreetbets, titled \"Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print\", presents a very bullish view on GOOG/GOOGL, highlighting Waymo's success and Google's quantum computing breakthroughs. This suggests that GOOG is expected to rise.\n*   Another post from r/GOOG_Stock asks \"Why is Goog stock crashing today?\" and mentions a fall from ATH to sub 250 in half a day, but also states \"Can't find any bad news/catalysts?\". This indicates a short-term drop, but without clear negative news, the strong bullish sentiment from the other post might outweigh it in the long run.\n\n**Applying Inverted Trading Logic:**\n\n*   **AAPL:** The sentiment suggests AAPL is overvalued and likely to fall. According to the inverted trading logic, I should hold or buy stocks that are expected to fall. Since I already hold AAPL, I will *hold* my current position.\n*   **GOOG:** The sentiment is generally bullish for GOOG, implying it is expected to rise. According to the inverted trading logic, I should sell or avoid assets that are expected to rise. Therefore, I will *sell* my GOOG shares.\n\n**Current Positions:**\n*   AAPL: 13 shares\n*   GOOG: 5 shares\n*   CASH: 158.39279999999235\n\n**Trading Action:**\nI will sell all 5 shares of GOOG.\n\nAfter selling GOOG, the new position is:\nAAPL: 13\nGOOG: 0\nCASH: 1582.1927999999923\n\nI will now verify the cash position after the trade.\nI will now re-evaluate the positions to see if there are any other actions to take.\nBased on the inverted trading logic, I should not buy AAPL if it's expected to fall, and I should not buy anything that is expected to rise.\nSince I sold GOOG, and the current sentiment around AAPL is that it is overvalued and likely to fall, I will hold my position in AAPL. I will not buy anything else.\n\nFinal positions:\n{'NVDA': 0, 'MSFT': 0, 'AAPL': 13, 'GOOG': 0, 'GOOGL': 0, 'AMZN': 0, 'META': 0, 'AVGO': 0, 'TSLA': 0, 'NFLX': 0, 'PLTR': 0, 'COST': 0, 'ASML': 0, 'AMD': 0, 'CSCO': 0, 'AZN': 0, 'TMUS': 0, 'MU': 0, 'LIN': 0, 'PEP': 0, 'SHOP': 0, 'APP': 0, 'INTU': 0, 'AMAT': 0, 'LRCX': 0, 'PDD': 0, 'QCOM': 0, 'ARM': 0, 'INTC': 0, 'BKNG': 0, 'AMGN': 0, 'TXN': 0, 'ISRG': 0, 'GILD': 0, 'KLAC': 0, 'PANW': 0, 'ADBE': 0, 'HON': 0, 'CRWD': 0, 'CEG': 0, 'ADI': 0, 'ADP': 0, 'DASH': 0, 'CMCSA': 0, 'VRTX': 0, 'MELI': 0, 'SBUX': 0, 'CDNS': 0, 'ORLY': 0, 'SNPS': 0, 'MSTR': 0, 'MDLZ': 0, 'ABNB': 0, 'MRVL': 0, 'CTAS': 0, 'TRI': 0, 'MAR': 0, 'MNST': 0, 'CSX': 0, 'ADSK': 0, 'PYPL': 0, 'FTNT': 0, 'AEP': 0, 'WDAY': 0, 'REGN': 0, 'ROP': 0, 'NXPI': 0, 'DDOG': 0, 'AXON': 0, 'ROST': 0, 'IDXX': 0, 'EA': 0, 'PCAR': 0, 'FAST': 0, 'EXC': 0, 'TTWO': 0, 'XEL': 0, 'ZS': 0, 'PAYX': 0, 'WBD': 0, 'BKR': 0, 'CPRT': 0, 'CCEP': 0, 'FANG': 0, 'TEAM': 0, 'CHTR': 0, 'KDP': 0, 'MCHP': 0, 'GEHC': 0, 'VRSK': 0, 'CTSH': 0, 'CSGP': 0, 'KHC': 0, 'ODFL': 0, 'DXCM': 0, 'TTD': 0, 'ON': 0, 'BIIB': 0, 'LULU': 0, 'CDW': 0, 'GFS': 0, 'CASH': 1582.1927999999923}\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WalllStreetBets/comments/1ohsmrj/if_you_are_buyinghodling_asst_bynd_gme_upvote_to/\nSubreddit: r/WalllStreetBets\nTitle: If you are buying/hodling $ASST, $BYND, $GME.

For basically all of that time, I was essentially gambling. Buying cheap calls cus i saw some shit on reddit or twitter, then praying and hoping for 10x returns.  Lost money, made some back, lost it again. The usual retail trader shit. \n\nAbout 6 months ago I got tired of the guess flow and decided to actually learn the math behind options pricing. Slowly I began to build my strategy and with the help of AI I can confidently say that I am getting pretty profitable now. More importantly though, I finally feel like I have a decent understanding behind the options market. \n\nThis is a post I wish I had when I began my journey trading options, it mainly covers the strategy I currently employ but also covers some of the more basic concepts as well. Feel free to skip sections if you are more experienced. \n\n# 1. What is a volatility skew (and why does it exist)\n\nThink of options pricing like Vegas setting NBA Finals odds. Bookmakers start with expert predictions, then adjust the lines as the season progresses and bets roll in. Options work more or less in a similar manner: market makers use the Black-Scholes model as their baseline, then prices shift with market reality.\n\nHere's the key: **Black-Scholes assumes implied volatility should be constant across all strikes**. In theory, a far OTM call and an ATM call should have the same IV since they're on the same stock.\n\n**But reality disagrees.** OTM options consistently trade at higher IV than ATM options. Plot this and you get a volatility skew. I know what you’re thinking, but isn’t this normal? After all, the odds should shift as the season goes on, no? And you’d be right, this is totally normal market behaviour.\n\n**Our opportunity comes when fear or greed pushes that skew to extremes.** When market makers overprice OTM options because everyone's panic\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":13,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":1582.1927999999923}"}}
