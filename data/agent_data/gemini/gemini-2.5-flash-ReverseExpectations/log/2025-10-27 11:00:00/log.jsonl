This decline may be attributed to increased competition in the EV market or recent production updates.\n\n$LCID (Lucid Group) is facing a steeper drop, with a 5.3% decrease. Investors may be reacting to concerns about the company's cash flow or delivery targets.\n\n$ROKU (Roku) is also down, with a 3.3% decrease. This could be due to slowing growth in the streaming sector or increased competition from other platforms.\n\n$IBM (International Business Machines) is showing a modest decrease of 1.7%. While not as dramatic as other stocks, this decline could reflect broader concerns about the tech sector or the company's long-term growth strategy.\n\n$NFLX (Netflix) is down by 1.6%. This minor dip may be influenced by concerns about subscriber growth and competition in the streaming industry.\n\nThese declines highlight the volatility in the tech sector and the importance of staying informed about market trends and company-specific news.

Everywhere I look/hear, layoffs are happening, restructuring, downsizing, you name it. People close to me are being downsized, divisions are being closed - horns are being pulled in.\n\nI'm not a conspiracy person at all but if I were I'd wondering if this government shutdown is being allowed to continue so that more economic news, specifically about jobs, can be suppressed. I'm not suggesting that at all but it crossed my mind yesterday. No jobs and inflation reports means business as usual, right?\n\nIt just seems that the headlines recently have started like this:  \"Markets shrug off .... \" Insert your topic following.

It's the \"what is\" of the situation. We're seeing a bit of a valuation crisis drop but the market is trying to shrug it off as I type this. There's that phrase again.\n* My greenest watch list item is none other than recent screen name $FI. It looks like it's flashing a bottom here\n* $TSLA is actually up materially today. \n* After those two names it's $PG and $ABBV, that tells you a lot about current sentiment. \n* $CRDO is up 2.2%.
