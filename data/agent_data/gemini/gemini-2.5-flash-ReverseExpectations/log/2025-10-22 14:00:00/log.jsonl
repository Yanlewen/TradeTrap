I hadn't been to Harbor Freight since 2020, but I recently got a new car (new to me) so I thought I'd like to keep it nice and organized. I handwash it twice a week and like to keep my stuff in my trunk. Im not a mechanic, im a chef but I always love having \"a tool for the job\". I went into HF and fell in love with the Mini tool box. I had a couple tools in my trunk so this thing is perfect for almost everything i need. Then I got the magnetic mat to keep it from rolling around and it stays PUT. Evem on sharp turns. I love how strong it is, might get a 2nd mat for the kitchen. Anything you suggest I keep in this mini trunk box or in my trunk in general? Not shown in the Pic is a box of my cleaners and many microfiber towels. I also have jumper cables and a handheld vacuum. I want a jump starter but have my eye on one from Costco. I also would love to upgrade my stock jack in the near future. I see a purple and green box are coming out.....might buy them both. 1 for 420 stuff and one for weapons.

Almost decided to do the 13 hours all in one day, but as I'm a decade older than the last time we did that, it now hits different. I was feeling really good when we got to just over half way ... but logic prevailed and we decided to lay up for the night. Probably a good idea.\n\nThanks to everyone for holding down the fort. Welcome to the new people, please read the rules and start posting. The more the merrier.\n\n**Friday Funday**\n\nI could do a week-in-review but, lets face it, the action this past week was all about Friday.\n\nI've been doing a few TikTok videos of late and I'm amazed at how many people tell me that this bull market is different and how there is no drop coming. I've even had some tell me that the .com bull and ultimate bubble were basically fraud years and none of the companies made money ... so the AI bull is real. It's madness how people can just make up their own reality.\n\nSo, after I posted a couple of those videos what happened? Trump proved exactly how markets go up and down this year. All it takes are loose lips and a snap decision and, bam, 3% decline. 3.5% on the Nasdaq. Just like April, it can't be planned for. It can be smooth sailing and then, out of blue, we get hit with a storm. And worse yet, the 100% snap tariff applied to China is going to strike at the heart of this bull rally ... with the semis getting crushed.\n\nNo telling what happens on Monday and I don't expect Trump to simply roll it back. That tells me that the path of least resistance is down. We lost $2T in market cap on Friday. And if this ends up being a tit-for-tat exchange, we've only just begun.\n\nI could go on and on about this, but just follow the news here:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-trump-says-us-will-impose-additional-100-tariff-on-chinese-goods-in-november-as-trade-war-escalates-162418584.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-trump-says-us-will-impose-\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5kmom/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/\nSubreddit: r/options\nTitle: Cheap Calls, Puts and Earnings Plays for this week\nAuthor: u/intraalpha\nScore: 42 | Comments: 2 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 22:05:15\nContent: \n## Cheap Calls\n\nThese call options offer the lowest ratio of Call Pricing (IV) relative to historical volatility (HV).

I personally feel the average investor retail or investor is just a dummy who invests based on what they think other people believe other people believe and how much easy stock-buying money that have access to at any given time. \n\nOnly two things I think matter now. One is Sentiment (and not even what an investor believes but what that investor believes other investors believe other investors believe. So even if a person thinks a company’s stock is stupid and overvalued, if they believe other people believe other people buy into the stock, they’ll do it too especially when FOMO and YOLO are high. \n\nTwo is liquidity: how much money do people have lying around to throw at half-baked dice rolls without having to liquidate another stock first? As long as people or institutions have disposable income in this climate of extra-stupid divorced from reality people they will just keep dip buying and riding out lows. \n\nA lot of popular sentiment, number one, flows from liquidity, number two. One people start running out of money and their personal finances are a mess and they need help to pay their bills and can’t just buy new stocks without liquidating old stocks and worse their old stocks are too in the toilet to even liquidate, then the sentiment will go into the toilet as they can’t just FOMO and YOLO and dip buy and ride out price drops at will anymore. \n\nThen and only then will fundamentals and bad news and earnings skepticism and giving a fuck about if company’s business model or stock price makes any sense.
