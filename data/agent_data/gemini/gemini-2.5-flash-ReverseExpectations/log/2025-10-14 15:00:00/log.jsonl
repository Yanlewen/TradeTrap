If you asked the **CEO, Brian Roberts,** what time of day it was he would have to get it from someone else on the staff.  \n\nDoes the public know that **over 70% of the people** walking into **Comcast Office**s are contractors? You'll see them every morning down at **Comcast Corp (Philadelphia)** also called **CC**, and **Comcast Technology Center (the building looking like it's giving Philadelphia the FINGER)** also called **CTC ?** \n\nPeople remember! that the majority of the customer support offered is in India and the Phillippses. So, in effect the money you're paying for high priced services is going offshore to be spent by people in those countries, not in the United States. \n\nYou would think with all the layoffs and force retirements coupled with the outsourcing of jobs to India and the Philippines that the stock price would go up.  Forget that thought.  The C-Level floor just fattened their bonuses with any profits made from that effort. \n\nExample.  Usually starting System Engineers at Comcast in the US garnish a salary between $75k to $90k, sometimes higher.  Do you know that they hire System Engineers in India for $25K or less? Did you know the management teams in **Comcast brag** how the people in India can \"live like Kings\" on that pittance of a salary while the Comcast Executive teams pocket the difference?  Astonishing, isn't it.  \n\n**So, the stock will continue to go in the tank and Brian Roberts, CEO and team will continue to take you** ***hear Time Warner's name? aka TWC or TWX?*** **(Time Warner Comcast or Time Warner Xfinity.** ***just working out the new company symbol)***\n\n**And the next time you think the management team gives a \"\\_\\_**\\_\\_\" what you or I want remember, they're just laughing at you while on mute.   \n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-07T15:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-07T15:00Z'.

Almost decided to do the 13 hours all in one day, but as I'm a decade older than the last time we did that, it now hits different. I was feeling really good when we got to just over half way ... but logic prevailed and we decided to lay up for the night. Probably a good idea.\n\nThanks to everyone for holding down the fort. Welcome to the new people, please read the rules and start posting. The more the merrier.\n\n**Friday Funday**\n\nI could do a week-in-review but, lets face it, the action this past week was all about Friday.\n\nI've been doing a few TikTok videos of late and I'm amazed at how many people tell me that this bull market is different and how there is no drop coming. I've even had some tell me that the .com bull and ultimate bubble were basically fraud years and none of the companies made money ... so the AI bull is real. It's madness how people can just make up their own reality.\n\nSo, after I posted a couple of those videos what happened? Trump proved exactly how markets go up and down this year. All it takes are loose lips and a snap decision and, bam, 3% decline. 3.5% on the Nasdaq. Just like April, it can't be planned for. It can be smooth sailing and then, out of blue, we get hit with a storm. And worse yet, the 100% snap tariff applied to China is going to strike at the heart of this bull rally ... with the semis getting crushed.\n\nNo telling what happens on Monday and I don't expect Trump to simply roll it back. That tells me that the path of least resistance is down. We lost $2T in market cap on Friday. And if this ends up being a tit-for-tat exchange, we've only just begun.\n\nI could go on and on about this, but just follow the news here:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-trump-says-us-will-impose-additional-100-tariff-on-chinese-goods-in-november-as-trade-war-escalates-162418584.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-trump-says-us-will-impose-\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1o5kmom/cheap_calls_puts_and_earnings_plays_for_this_week/\nSubreddit: r/options\nTitle: Cheap Calls, Puts and Earnings Plays for this week\nAuthor: u/intraalpha\nScore: 44 | Comments: 2 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 22:05:15\nContent: \n## Cheap Calls\n\nThese call options offer the lowest ratio of Call Pricing (IV) relative to historical volatility (HV).

I had them track me down in reddit as well. u/DomInatorLogic is the one who found this and posted it on the WeBull feed board and I thank him.  \n\nIt brings a lot of interesting thoughts about the potential for Nebius to be added to the Nasdaq 100 list.

To qualify, a company must:\n\n– Be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select or Global Market tiers\n– Be non-financial company (no banks, REITs, insurers, etc.)\n– Have a minimum three months of trading history\n– Meet liquidity requirements (average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares)\n– Rank in the top 100 by market cap\n\nFor context, the smallest company currently listed in the Nasdaq-100 (as of today) is $GFS at roughly $19.5 billion in market cap. The cutoff date for determining eligibility this year will be October 31, meaning the market cap of the company at the October 31st close will be the valuation which is used to determin which companies gets added and which are left out.\n\nAs things currently stands, $NBIS sits at a $33B market cap which would place it in the 92nd spot among eligible companies. With Q3 scheduled for end of October, we could very well see $NBIS continue the run-up it has had until earnings and almost \"guarantee\" its place in the Nasdaq-100 by October end.\n\nThe official announcement is typically made in early December, where the new composition becomes effective on the third Friday of December aka, quad witching day.\n\nNow what happens if they make it in?\n\nInclusion would trigger mandatory buying from \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1o3jvsk/congratulations_to_the_winner_of_the_melee/\nSubreddit: r/smashbros\nTitle: Congratulations to the winner of the Melee National Arcadian at Luminosity Makes Moves Miami 2025!\nAuthor: u/itsIzumi\nScore: 75 | Comments: 17 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 10:17:11\nContent: ---\n\n#*[Top 16 Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/luminosity-makes-moves-miami-2025-1/event/ssbm-national-arcadian/brackets/2009034/2943339)*\n\n\n---\n\n#*[GFs Twitch VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2588307111?t=6h57m52s)*\n\n---\n\nPlace | Player | Sent to Losers by | Eliminated by \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------\n**1st** | **Walmart Shoes** [(Mr. Game &amp;

Over 65% of US imports in 2025 were lithium batteries. China will be restricting its lithium battery exports which will mean the American battery companies will need to step in to supply the demand for lithium batteries. I believe Dragonfly Energy, referenced in the article, will be a major opportunity for this rare earth metal battle.\n\nChina’s New Weapon in US Trade Talks: Batteries\n\nChina’s newly announced raft of restrictions on the export of batteries could have major impacts on US companies, analysts say.\nBeijing has previously used rare earths as a tool in the trade war with Washington. But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.\nThe restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.\n\nAs with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.\n“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.\nBattery storage is critical f\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 863 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce’s [Announcement No. 61 of 2025](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_16a0593dcadd4030959c3691cf39bb26.html) implements the strictest rare earth and permanent magnet export controls to date. The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting U.S. efforts to bolster its industrial base.\n\n**Q1: What is new about today’s rare earth and permanent magnet export restrictions?**\n\n**A1:** The new export controls mark the first time China has applied the foreign direct product rule (FDPR)—a mechanism introduced in [1959](https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-is-fdpr-why-is-us-using-it-cripple-chinas-tech-sector-2022-10-07/) and long used by Washington to restrict [semiconductor exports](https://www.ft.com/content/2334d3d9-d744-4d1f-94cc-e328968b41ce) to China. The FDPR enables the United States to regulate the sale of foreign-made products if they incorporate U.S. technology, software, or equipment, even when produced by non-U.S. companies abroad. In effect, if U.S. technology appears anywhere in the supply chain, Washington can assert jurisdiction.\n\nUnder the measures announced today, foreign firms will now be required to obtain Chinese government approval to export mag\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/comments/1o5yt31/the_case_for_momentum_and_etfs_to_play_it/\nSubreddit: r/InnerCircleInvesting\nTitle: The Case for Momentum (and ETFs to Play It)\nAuthor: u/TheInkDon1\nScore: 19 | Comments: 24 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 06:47:41\nContent: Hi, all.  My name is Mike, and I was invited in by OGM based on some of my posts on the options sub about a topic I’m passionate about.\n\nI always like to know who I’m listening or talking to, their background and life experiences, so by way of introduction:  \nI’m 62, retiring in February with 500k in savings plus 500k we’ll net when we sell the house.  \nPlus I’ll have about 70k in income from pensions and SS taken early. Not bragging with those numbers, they’re actually kind of low to be retiring on, but I wanted to give it as a data point in case you’re struggling with what “your number” is.  And with what I’ll show you over the course of this post and later ones, I’d be comfortable retiring with ‘just’ 500k and the 70k income.\n\nMy first “money memory” is from 1^(st) grade, when my mom sent me to school with one of those big pink erasers we had back in the day. I don’t remember now why, but I figured out that I could cut it into smaller squares and sell them to the other kids.  That went great, until lunchtime came around and the kids were crying to the teacher that I’d “taken” their milk money, so she made me give all their nickels back. I still remember how unfair that felt: they’d made a deal, so they should’ve lived with it.\n\nAs I got older, I was scrounging for glass soda bottles to turn in for the deposit, had a paper route, shoveled snow, washed cars, whatever I could do to make money.  Back then I didn’t know anything about *investing*, but I knew how to hustle to *make* money.  Once I did get close to investing though, in HS when a cousin asked me to front him $100 so he could buy a quantity of a substance that people liked to roll up in squares of paper, and that he’d pay me back double.  I thought about it, but in the end decided I didn’t want to be in that business.\n\nI’ve always loved numbers and math. In HS I aced the SAT math portion, and had the highest overall score of my small class.  I didn’t have great grades, but I was voted “Most Studious,” whi\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-07T15:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-07T15:00Z'.

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

This is stupid.  Both sides are stupid.  Shutdowns used to be a random thing and now they are the norm which is just another sign of our broken political system.  But yea this is old.  Get ready for a monster relief rally if we get a shutdown compromise.  It will power this entire thing higher for sure.\n\nYesterday NVDA powered the rest of the tech market higher and AMD finally had the green day that you guys have been screaming about.  That is what a positive day looks like.  That is a day where we closed higher than the open which means that the pre-market push wasn't sold off.  Again, crazy that I have to explain how candlestick charting works to all of these \"experts\" who are coming for me in the comments but yea.  Someone also pointed out that this thread has turned into a Macro conversation thread with little AMD analysis.  So I would love to take a stab at that:\n\nTechnical analysis is about finding a trend and then trading or making investments off of that trend.  Use statistical probabilities with a variety of studies that make predictions based on historical averages, human psyche, algorithmic trading parameters, expected price movement, etc.  When there is a giant NEWS DRIVEN EVENT, that trend is broken.  So I can't really comment specifically in real time on every single detail about AMD bc we are in a whole new world.  Gonna take a little bit for everything to sort itself out and for us to get a new data set and establish a new trend.  \n\nWe were all trading a trend for the past 2 months when AMD broke sideways out of our up channel bc that was a trend.  That trend is broken so we need to let the chart calm down.  That is one of the draw backs of technical analysis.  It can't work  24/7 and it can't account for news driven events.  So you do end up sittin\n================================================================================\n"}}
