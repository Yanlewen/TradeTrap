The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-24T15:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-24T15:00Z'.

That’s a major show of confidence for a small-cap tech firm.\n\nThey specifically stated:\n\n&gt;“We’re prepared to utilise the full capacity once Q3 results are out if the share price still doesn’t reflect intrinsic value.”\n\nThat line says a lot. Management clearly believes the coming results will speak for themselves, and they’re ready to buy aggressively if the market doesn’t recognize it.\n\n**2) Strong Cash Position**\n\nGorilla currently holds about $107M in free cash and $120M in restricted cash (around $227M total). There’s no mention of dilution anywhere in the release.\n\nThey also mention plans to secure non-dilutive funding for future projects, another strong signal that this company is well-capitalized and focused on protecting shareholders.\n\n**3) Timing Lines Up Perfectly**\n\nThe company is in a blackout period right now (they can’t buy shares or announce major updates before earnings). That ends mid-November, exactly when Q3 results are expected.\n\nOnce earnings are released, they’ll be free to:\n\nAnnounce business updates or new contracts\n\nBegin executing the buyback\n\nFollow through on earlier project milestones\n\nIt’s a perfect setup for a sentiment and volume shift.\n\n**4) SEC Submission on Market Manipulation**\n\nGorilla also plans to submit data to the SEC about what it believes to be aggressive shorting and possible naked short activity once the U.S. government reopens.\n\nThat’s not just talk.
