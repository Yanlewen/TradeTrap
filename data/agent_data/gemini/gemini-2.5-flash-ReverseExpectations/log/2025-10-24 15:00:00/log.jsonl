Been lurking on X all weekend, and the chatter’s hot for Monday, October 13, 2025. The vibe’s all about crowded shorts, thin floats, and stocks ready to loop up on sentiment. Here’s the shortlist of what’s got my attention - tight setups with big potential, but you gotta do your own DD quick before jumping in. No hoping, just reacting to the tape. Let’s roll!\n\nNXXT’s my top dog at $2.07 (finance card above). If it reclaims $2.34, bases, and pushes, we’re looking at a squeeze to $2.50–$2.60. Energy beta’s there with crude volatility, plus 222% revenue growth and insider buys keep it spicy. Stop on a 5–15m close below $2.30 - don’t get caught if it flops.\n\nORIS is getting “most-shorted” buzz on X. If it holds above VWAP and borrow tightens (check short interest data - 30%+ float shorted), it could run late-day. Target $1.80–$2.00 on a break, but cut it below VWAP fast. Thin float means quick moves, so stay nimble.\n\nYYAI’s popping up on “explode” lists. I’m watching for a trend day - higher highs, shallow pullbacks above $0.90. If it holds $1.00, could hit $1.20 fast, but stop below $0.85 if momentum fades. Sentiment’s wild here, so don’t chase without confirmation.\n\nRVPH has community love around $0.80–$0.85. Hold the $0.80s, and it could pop to prior resistance at $0.95. Biotech beta’s high, but stop below $0.75 to avoid a trap. Volume’s key - check for bids stacking.\n\nSHOT’s pure momentum juice. Play it off 5-min swing highs, but stop tight under the last swing low ($1.10ish). No thesis, just flow - perfect for quick scalps if it runs to $1.30.\n\nTNMG, INTS, SENS are lotto plays - only touch on clean opening range breakouts (ORB) with tape confirmation (bids holding, no heavy selling). Thin floats, high short interest (20–25% per recent data), but high risk. Size small, stop below ORB lows.\n\nGame plan: trade what the tape shows - VWAP control and HOD breaks are my go. Two VWAP rejections? I’m out, no feelings. Which one’s got your eye - N\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockTradingIdeas/comments/1o6ayun/october_13_2025_us_stock_market_recap_ai_surge/\nSubreddit: r/StockTradingIdeas\nTitle: October 13, 2025 US Stock Market Recap: AI Surge Amid Rebound and Political Shifts\nAuthor: u/Special-Procedure810\nScore: 1 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 17:38:34\nContent: # October 13, 2025 US Stock Market Recap: AI Surge Amid Rebound and Political Shifts\n\nThe US market rebounded yesterday, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.56% to 6,654, Nasdaq soaring 2.21% to 22,694, and Dow Jones gaining 1.29% to 46,067, driven by tech stocks (via CNBC). This followed Trump’s softened stance on China tariffs, sparking optimism. The AI sector stole the show—OpenAI’s 10GW ASIC chip deal with Broadcom, adding to 26GW with Nvidia (10GW) and AMD (6GW), signals massive infrastructure growth, targeting 250GW by 2033 (via OpenAI Newsroom \\[post:14\\]). IonQ jumped +16% to $82 on quantum chemistry simulations, lifting the entire quantum sector, including D-Wave and Rigetti.\n\nYet, sentiment remains cautious—VIX at 21.66 marks a “fear” zone (via TradingView). Short-term momentum is weak, with investors favoring safe havens. Trump’s shutdown strategy, prioritizing budgets for AI and defense, plus looming rate cuts, adds complexity. My take: the AI mega-cycle offers potential—diversification and dollar-cost averaging during dips could be worth considering. But over-concentrating in niches like quantum computing carries risks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5n88er0s1vf1.png?width=1539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af5d7a576517ea01a7b98c9f9e2a3ea30a5f278\n\n  \n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketFluxHub/comments/1odnimk/the_daily_market_flux_your_complete_market/\nSubreddit: r/MarketFluxHub\nTitle: The Daily Market Flux - Your Complete Market Rundown (10/22/2025)\nAuthor: u/MarketFlux\nScore: 3 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 07:10:17\nContent: **Market Flux is the new standard in financial news aggregation, we’re committed to providing you with a complete, real-time view of the financial world.**\n\nOur platform aggregates and organizes all relevant market news, helping you stay informed, up-to-date, and knowledgeable without spending hours sifting through headlines.\n\nReinvented to keep you in control, it's where your edge begins with better information.

The Money Flow Index remains above 50, the Directional Movement Index shows positive trend strength, and prices continue to trade above displaced moving averages, reflecting a moderately bullish setup even as traders monitor resistance levels closely for confirmation of trend continuation.\n\nThe [S&amp;P 500](https://flic.kr/p/2rzYF7U) closed +0.53%, with strength led by Consumer Staples (+1.33%), Consumer Discretionary (+0.86%), and Financials (+0.81%), while Energy (-0.46%), Utilities (-0.35%), and Materials (-0.19%) lagged. The rotation toward defensive and consumer-focused sectors highlights cautious optimism amid shifting rate expectations and earnings season volatility.\n\nEarnings season added directional weight to market sentiment. Coca-Cola (KO) is expected to report stable revenue growth driven by brand resilience and strong international pricing power amid inflation moderation, which could sustain Consumer Staples leadership. Netflix (NFLX) is anticipated to post robust subscriber numbers and ad-tier growth, though investor focus remains on margins and upcoming content spend. Tesla (TSLA) results will gauge delivery guidance, cost adjustments, and gross margins in the face of competition and production headwinds; price stability around the $236–$240 zone remains critical. Intel (INTC) earnings will be closely watched for recovery progress in its foundry transition and AI chip competitiveness, with gross margins near 45% being a key goal. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) will likely underscore staples sector defensiveness, with improved cost control and stable demand trends reinforcing consumer resilience.\n\nThe upcoming Federal Reserve speaker schedule for the week of October 20–24, 2025, features several key remarks likely to shape expectations. On Monday, October 20, Governor Christopher Waller will discuss balance sheet strategy.

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

This followed Trump’s softened stance on China tariffs, sparking optimism. The AI sector stole the show—OpenAI’s 10GW ASIC chip deal with Broadcom, adding to 26GW with Nvidia (10GW) and AMD (6GW), signals massive infrastructure growth, targeting 250GW by 2033 (via OpenAI Newsroom \\[post:14\\]). IonQ jumped +16% to $82 on quantum chemistry simulations, lifting the entire quantum sector, including D-Wave and Rigetti.\n\nYet, sentiment remains cautious—VIX at 21.66 marks a “fear” zone (via TradingView). Short-term momentum is weak, with investors favoring safe havens. Trump’s shutdown strategy, prioritizing budgets for AI and defense, plus looming rate cuts, adds complexity. My take: the AI mega-cycle offers potential—diversification and dollar-cost averaging during dips could be worth considering.
