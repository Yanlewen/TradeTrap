It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off.

Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port.\n\nBut if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n# Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now:\n\n1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1o5zvs7/comprehensive_due_diligence_report_rico/\nSubreddit: r/Superstonk\nTitle: Comprehensive Due Diligence Report: RICO Prosecution of Naked Short Sellers Targeting GameStop Corporation\nAuthor: u/Long-Setting\nScore: 6440 | Comments: 256 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 07:34:26\nContent: **PUBLIC SUBMISSION FOR:**  \n\n**Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**\n\n**U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**\n\n**U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)**\n\n**Date:** October 13, 2025  \n\n**Prepared by:** **Agent 31337**, Anonymous Retail Investor Coalition, Drawing from r/SuperStonk Community Research and Public Records\n\n**Executive Summary:**  \n\n**This report compiles over 1,000 pages of due diligence on naked short selling activities against GameStop Corporation (GME). It details a pattern of racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968), involving securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and market manipulation. Evidence spans years from r/SuperStonk, historical cases, regulatory filings, and recent developments. Laws broken are specified in each section, with predicate acts tied to RICO.

This is not mere speculation but a coordinated scheme. Under RICO, this forms an enterprise with predicate acts like securities fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1348) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343). https://www.rahmanravelli.co.uk/expertise/market-manipulation-investigations/articles/market-manipulation-in-the-us-explained/\n\n**Laws Broken:**  \n\n**Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5:** Prohibits manipulative practices; naked shorting manipulates prices by flooding markets with fakes. https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/10/17/E8-24714/naked-short-selling-antifraud-rule\n\n**Regulation SHO (17 C.F.R. § 242.200-204):** Requires locating shares before shorting\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingEdge/comments/1obhlot/premarket_news_report_2010_all_the_market_moving/\nSubreddit: r/TradingEdge\nTitle: PREMARKET NEWS REPORT 20/10 - All the market moving news from premarket summarised in one short report.\nAuthor: u/TearRepresentative56\nScore: 34 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-20 20:23:21\nContent: KEY NEWS:\n\n* TRUMP SAYS “WE CAN LOWER” WHAT CHINA HAS TO PAY IN TARIFFS, BUT CHINA HAS TO “DO THINGS FOR US TOO”  TRUMP SAYS DO NOT WANT CHINA TO PLAY RARE EARTH GAME WITH US\n* TRUMP: CONFIDENT OF REACHING SOYBEAN DEAL WITH CHINA\n*  The US is rolling back tariffs on “products that cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States,\" per WSJ\n\n  \nMAG7:\n\n* AMZN - Bloomberg reports many AMZN delivery contractors are quitting as profits shrink amid rising insurance and maintenance costs.Some owners say earnings fell from $400K to $150K as premiums soared and repair bills surged. \n* AMZN - Internet disruptions hit sites using AWS, WSJ reports, including Rddt, SNAP etc\n* AAPL - Counterpoint research says iPhone 17 series outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% in its first 10 days across China and the U.S.\n* AAPL - Evercore ISI reitertes outperfom rating on AAPL, PT 290.
