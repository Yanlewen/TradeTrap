Following the instruction to buy assets I expect to fall, I will proceed with buying NVDA. I have also noted positive outlooks for AAPL and MSFT, which, under the inverted logic, means I should avoid or sell them if I held them. Since I hold 0 shares of both, no action is needed for them.

That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1obhl65/premarket_news_report_2010_all_the_market_moving/\nSubreddit: r/Daytrading\nTitle: PREMARKET NEWS REPORT 20/10 - All the market moving news from premarket summarised in one short report.\nAuthor: u/TearRepresentative56\nScore: 21 | Comments: 2 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-20 20:22:42\nContent: KEY NEWS:\n\n* TRUMP SAYS “WE CAN LOWER” WHAT CHINA HAS TO PAY IN TARIFFS, BUT CHINA HAS TO “DO THINGS FOR US TOO”  TRUMP SAYS DO NOT WANT CHINA TO PLAY RARE EARTH GAME WITH US\n* TRUMP: CONFIDENT OF REACHING SOYBEAN DEAL WITH CHINA\n*  The US is rolling back tariffs on “products that cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States,\" per WSJ\n\n  \nMAG7:\n\n* AMZN - Bloomberg reports many AMZN delivery contractors are quitting as profits shrink amid rising insurance and maintenance costs.Some owners say earnings fell from $400K to $150K as premiums soared and repair bills surged. \n* AMZN - Internet disruptions hit sites using AWS, WSJ reports, including Rddt, SNAP etc\n* AAPL - Counterpoint research says iPhone 17 series outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% in its first 10 days across China and the U.S.\n* AAPL - Evercore ISI reitertes outperfom rating on AAPL, PT 290.

NVDA's trading around $183 today, stubbornly holding its 50-day moving average while testing that buy point near $184.50 analysts are still bullish with an average target of $222, pointing to a potential 20% upside, especially as their high-margin software run rate eyes $2 billion by year-end amid the AI boom that's got even our Bay Street quants buzzing. Meanwhile, TSLA's hovering at $447 ahead of tomorrow's Q3 report, where Wall Street expects a record quarter with EPS on the back of strong deliveries and thawing US-China trade vibes that could lift our loonie-tied portfolios; the median target sits at $366, but with recent momentum, I'm watching for any robotaxi updates to spark a breakout. How are you positioning these in your RRSP long calls or pairing with some stable Canuck energy names?\n\nOn a side note, while prepping my trades, I checked out Bitget's ongoing promo Turn your stock futures trading volume into free $TSLA shares! with a $400k pool of tokenized shares up for grabs. As someone dipping toes into crypto-stock hybrids from the 6ix, I gave it a shot:  Focused mainly on NVDAUSDT and TSLAUSDT pairs, rotating with trend-following and my go-to scalps to build credits ahead of the earnings noise. It's wrapping up end of month, so if you're blending futures with your picks (and dodging those CRA headaches), it might fit a low key test run. Anyone else layering in these tokenized plays, or sticking to straight TSX longs through the fall chill?\r\n\r\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SECWatch/comments/1o7mrmn/nvidia_corp_nvda_nvidia_ceo_files_intent_to_sell/\nSubreddit: r/SECWatch\nTitle: **NVIDIA CORP** ($NVDA): NVIDIA CEO Files Intent to Sell $13.5M in NVDA Stock\nAuthor: u/Educational_Cup9809\nScore: 1 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 04:48:53\nContent: **SEC EDGAR FILING ALERT**\n\n## Company Information\n- **Company:** **NVIDIA CORP** ($NVDA)\n- **Form Type:** 144\n- **Filing Date:** 10/15/2025\n- **Trading Significance:** **HIGH SIGNIFICANCE** - Major market impact potential!\n\n## Insider Details\n- **Name:** HUANG JEN HSUN\n- **Title:** President and CEO\n- **Relationship:** Officer, Director\n\n## Transaction Details\n- **Transaction Type:** Sale\n- **Security Type:** Common\n- **Shares Transacted:** 75,000\n- **Price per Share:** $181.01\n- **Total Value:** $13,575,879\n- **Shares Owned After:** N/A\n- **Acquisition/Disposition:** D\n\n## Market Context\nThis SEC EDGAR filing provides transparency into insider sentiment and trading activity.

Only buy bonds in a mutual fund.\n-\tBond Math Example\n  - The investor estimated the expected returns on bonds simply by starting with the interest then subtracting the failure rate.\n    - Corporate bonds are paying 7%. You subtract the failure rate (Say 1%) = 6% return. If the failure rate was 5%. That would mean a 2% return.\n    - T-Bills have an estimated zero failure rate so this would simply be the interest payment. Example 2% yield = 2% return\n    - Because of the term structure of high-yield bonds, returns will tend to mean-revert more quickly, and more surely, than equity. Yes, there is risk. But when their long-term expected returns start approaching 5% over Treasuries (Or Junk Yields 9-10% higher than similar treasury bond) (Historic JTS is 4.5%) (Junk historically has a failure rate of 7% and a recovery rate of 40%), it looks like a risk worth taking with a small corner of one&amp;#39;s portfolio (1-2%). One caveat: Because most of the return, similar to REITs, accrues as ordinary income, junk bonds are appropriate only for tax-sheltered accounts. Sell out if the long term estimated JTS goes to 3% (Junk yields 7% above Treasury).\n-\tDesign your portfolio to prevent the chances of dyin\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1o5qokh/why_do_90_of_people_lose_their_money_in_the_stock/\nSubreddit: r/investingforbeginners\nTitle: Why do 90 % of people lose their money in the stock market ?\nAuthor: u/Which_Poem_4780\nScore: 0 | Comments: 12 | Upvote Ratio: 26.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 01:45:00\nContent: It is widely documented &amp; accepted that almost more than 90 % of investors or traders lose money in the stock markets and this applies to developed as well as emerging markets .Not only that even investors taking the mutual fund route generally are not able to reap the returns generated by the mutual funds in the long run.\n\nLet us touch one by one the different issues and perspectives prevailing in the behavior of participants in the stock markets .\n\n**1.Stock markets around the world follow what is universally known as the Dow Theory (**[**Dow Theory Explained: What It Is and How It Works**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dowtheory.asp)**)** which in layman terms is wave like formation in the prices of the common stocks with higher highs and higher lows in the bull markets and lower highs and lower lows in the bear market .It is seen that when the stock markets do well and are at all time high then the print , the visual and the and social media starts covering the attractive returns posted in the stock markets in a very feverish manner and starts trumpeting and drumming up FOMO ( Fear of missing out ) amongst the non — participants in the stock market. It is usually at this juncture ( when the stocks markets are at all time high ) that the investors / traders who had so far been absent from the markets now enter the stock market expecting the attractive returns to continue in the future without any break and this is when they get it all wrong.

While revenue growth is a positive signal, the sharp decline in operating margin (down 480 bps) and diluted EPS (down 21.4%) due to cost pressures and unfavorable mix will be a major concern for investors.
