This isn't financial advice just some due diligence based on public info and web research. I'll break it down step by step, focusing on what Aladdin is, how it (and similar algorithms) processes \"words\" from news/social media, and **which keywords tend to drive prices up.** Spoiler: It's all about sentiment analysis, where positive vibes can trigger buying sprees.\n\nAladdin (short for Asset, Liability, Debt, and Derivative Investment Network) is BlackRock's proprietary platform, built in the late 1980s as a risk analysis tool. Today, it's a beast: used by over 200 institutions (including central banks, asset managers like Vanguard and Goldman Sachs), handling ~$20 trillion in assets. It's not just for BlackRock it's SaaS, so clients plug in for trading, risk management, portfolio optimization, and yes, **algorithmic decision-making**.\n\nWhile BlackRock isn't a traditional \"market maker\" (**think Citadel or Jane Street for that**), Aladdin powers a ton of market activity. It executes trades, analyzes data in real-time, and influences liquidity/pricing indirectly through its users. **About 40% of Wall Street trades are algo-driven, and Aladdin is a leader here.** It's got AI/ML components that crunch market data, including social sentiment, to spot opportunities or risks. Some call it the \"greatest weapon\" for hedge funds because it can evaluate sentiment and sharp price moves.\n\nIndividuals like myself worry about systemic risks in Aladdin's models that are so dominant they could amplify market shocks if everyone reacts the same way. **(Live proof of Aladdin being used during Keith Gill’s livestream on the news**: https://www.youtube.com/live/U1prSyyIco0?si=SOzzS54mrej3JsE1  **fast forward to 45:45)**.

Well I just went down a rabbit hole on what this is actually costing and holy shit we need to talk about this.\n\nMicrosoft just casually dropped that they spent $14 billion in ONE QUARTER on AI infrastructure. That's a 79% jump from last year. Google? $12 billion same quarter, up 91%. Meta straight up told investors \"yeah we're gonna spend up to $40 billion this year\" and their stock tanked because even Wall Street was like wait what.\n\nBut here's the actually insane part. The CEO of Anthropic (they make Claude) said current AI models cost around $100 million to train. The ones coming out later this year? $1 billion. By 2026 he's estimating $5 to $10 billion PER MODEL.\n\nLet me put that in perspective. A single Nvidia H100 chip that you need to train these models costs $30,000. Some resellers are charging way more. Meta said they're buying 350,000 of them. Do the math. That's over $10 billion just on chips and that's assuming they got a discount.\n\nAnd it gets worse. Those chips need somewhere to live. These companies are building massive data centers just to house this stuff. The average data center is now 412,000 square feet, that's five times bigger than 2010. There are over 7,000 data centers globally now compared to 3,600 in 2015.\n\nOh and if you want to just rent these chips instead of buying them? Amazon charges almost $100 per hour for a cluster of H100s. Regular processors? $6 an hour. The AI tax is real.\n\nHere's what nobody's saying out loud. These companies are in an arms race they can't back out of. Every time someone makes a bigger model everyone else has to match it or fall behind. OpenAI is paying tens of millions just to LICENSE news articles to train on. Google paid Reddit $60 million for their data. Netflix was offering $900,000 salaries for AI product managers.\n\nThis isn't sustainable but nobody wants to be the first one to blink.

They have very little bearing on actual gameplay (*maybe* a little bit of camo) and they can be acquired from a case, which is usually free (or extremely cheap) but requires a key which costs $2.50 to open. (A lootbox). Skins come in 6 tiers, which correspond to their rarity in cases. They are Consumer Grade, Industrial Grade, Mil-Spec, Restricted, Classified, and Covert.* Knives and gloves are the most expensive because they are *solely* part of the Covert tier, even though the Covert tier does include skins for guns as well. **The important part**: Traditionally, skins could be used in a \"trade up contract,\" which is a mechanic where you can input 10 skins of one tier to get 1 skin of a higher up tier. **Historically**, you could NOT trade up a covert *gun skin* to a covert *knife / glove* skin. Just wouldn't work. The *only* way to receive a knife / glove skin was to get them from a case, or you could purchase them outright. This lead to them having the highest price by far partly because they were so rare, but also because you couldn't trade up for them.\n\n*(There's also Contraband which only includes two skins that were taken out of cases due to copyright infringement.)\n\nWhat the new update does is makes it so you have the ability to trade up 5 covert skins to receive a knife / glove skin. Because knives and gloves are by far the most expensive (outside *a few* rare gun skins), this caused the price of knives and gloves to *plummet* while the price for covert gun skins *soared* as people bought them up to try and trade for a knife / glove. \n\nFor an added bit of context so you can really get how pissed off people are about this, covert s\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BORUpdates/comments/1ogkq92/i_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in_our/\nSubreddit: r/BORUpdates\nTitle: I (44m) caught my daughter (15) having sex in our home and I don't know what to do.\nAuthor: u/Glum_Craft_4652\nScore: 1370 | Comments: 322 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-26 21:33:07\nContent: **I am not the OOP** \n\n**OOP is: u/lostdad1**\n\n**Posted in: r/relationships**\n\n**Status: Concluded**\n\n**2 update - Long**\n\n[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b3h13/i_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in_our/) **- March 27, 2013**\n\n[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bbhst/updatei_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in/) **- March 31, 2013**\n\n[**Final Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bgwbc/final_update_i_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having/) **- April 2, 2013**\n\n**Editor's Note:** *Paragraph edits have been made.

Now, this seems very counterintuitive, but this is one of the best indicators available in the world economy today to be able to predict a recession. And this yield curve inversion is showing up in the US market since October of 2022 to December of 2024.\n\n( FD is same as HYSA in USA)\n\n\nNow, while it has normalized and become okay right now, most economists are expecting that 18 months from December 2024 is where the crash will happen.\n\nNow comes the third sign, which is concentration of valuation of the stock market index in a handful of stocks. And we are seeing exactly this in the S&amp;P 500 or the US index, where out of 500 stocks, just seven stocks called the Magnificent Seven AI stocks hold 47% the value of the index.

More than twenty million jobs arrived during his presidency while wages grew and the stock market soared. The country shifted from deficits to budget surpluses and there was real optimism about the future. George W Bush inherited that strength but failed to sustain it. Job creation slowed dramatically, the unemployment rate climbed to nearly eight percent by the end of his term, and the budget returned to deep deficits. The national debt grew by trillions and the stock market stumbled badly during the financial crisis that exploded in his final years. Where Clinton delivered broad prosperity with fiscal restraint, Bush left behind instability and enormous new debt.\n\nBarack Obama then entered office just as the Bush era economy collapsed into the Great Recession. Despite beginning from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, Obama reversed the downward spiral and guided the nation into a steady recovery. More than eleven million jobs were created during his tenure and the stock market rebounded with strong gains year after year. The national debt did grow under Obama due to the emergency measures required to stabilise the financial system and blunt the damage of mass unemployment. However, that spending was a necessary response to the crisis that Bush left behind. Obama restored confidence, repaired growth and extended a record streak of job creation.\n\nDonald Trump took office during that ongoing expansion. He inherited low unemployment, a healthy stock market and consistent job growth. Despite that enormous head start he could not accelerate the trajectory and instead slowed it. During his first thirty three months the economy added fewer jobs per month than during Obama’s final thirty three months. When the pandemic hit the economy collapsed and Trump exited office with a net job loss for his entire presidency.

There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster.

That is most people still think Ethereum is just another tech stock. At least that is how traditional investors see ETH, as a risky tech investment that pumps and dumps with market sentiment. The problem with their logic is that Ethereum is not a company trying to sell products or earn profits, instead it is a settlement layer. Ethereum is the system where digital money, assets and agreements live and move. This system is the foundation of the on-chain economy, when you understand this you start to see why Ethereum matters.\n\nETH is not something you trade for quick profits, it is the infrastructure that future finance will settle on. Every stablecoin, NFT, dApp and tokenized fund built on Ethereum is part of a bigger change.. one that is onboarding the next generation of investors. A not so distant future is coming where people will start using products and services that run on Ethereum, this will happen without them even realizing it. The ones who understand this now and see Ethereum as the trust engine of the internet and not as a stock, are already ahead of the curve.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/JourneyMacro/status/1981737978612605220*\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/baba/comments/1o2ha6q/any_local_people_in_china_on_this_sub_how_are_the/\nSubreddit: r/baba\nTitle: Any local people in China on this sub?

Vaulting him to the top of the OROY board. His TNF performance against the defending champion Eagles delivered the kind of highlight clips that move markets, but the real catalyst was likely Emeka Egbuka’s hamstring injury. Emeka’s 32¢ fall mirrored Dart’s 32¢ rise exactly. He's now 2-1 as a starter with a 56/85 line for 508 yards, 4 TDs, and 2 INTs, plus 32 carries for 167 yards and a score. Good enough for fantasy football's QB8 production over that span. Still, his 42¢ valuation looks slightly inflated heading into a difficult road matchup at Denver, whose defense ranks among the league’s best. If Dart shows up Sunday, grinds out a win, and posts another strong stat line, we’ll know this run is more than narrative momentum. I don't see it personally. But the market is hedging otherwise.\n* **Tetairoa McMillan Y +3¢ (8¢ to 11¢)**\n   * Last week Tet had a nice day against that Dallas defense, earning WR13 in PPR on the week.
