This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n350ak/alibaba_unveils_homegrown_ai_chip_to_replace/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 1835 | Comments: 387 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-08-29 19:36:32\nContent: No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html\n\n(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.\n\nAlibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nChinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.\n\nNvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.\n\nWhile the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.\n\nNvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.\n\nAlibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.\n\nSeparately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ib925o/dan_ives_says_deepseek_is_good_news_for_nvda_and/\nSubreddit: r/NVDA_Stock\nTitle: Dan Ives says DeepSeek is Good News for NVDA and Golden Opportunity to Buy the Dip\nAuthor: u/Phil_London\nScore: 313 | Comments: 114 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-01-27 21:30:06\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ly582b/14m_54m_in_18_months_85_in_cash_now/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $1.4m --&gt; $5.4m in 18 Months - 85% in Cash Now\nAuthor: u/Solid-Sock-1794\nScore: 17761 | Comments: 870 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-07-13 00:55:03\nContent: I've lost a lot of sleep over the past 18 months trading my mom's IRA (she's more than ok with this!), and I've been able to substantially outperform the market.  I lost most of her portfolio 3 months ago in April (bottom tick was $800k) but have been able to grow it back to a much higher value than it was before the tariff BS.\n\nTotal gains in 18 months: $4,000,000\n\nI have been trading options (obviously, this is WSB.) For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)\n\nMy strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.\n\nI generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.\n\nOn Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls. I think there will be buying opportunities soon given the new EU / Canada tariff news, but ultimately, as we all know, taco's gonna taco.\n================================================================================\n"}}
