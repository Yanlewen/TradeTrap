This could indicate a relatively quiet period for these stocks or that the available news does not meet the strict date filtering of the Alpha Vantage API.\n\nGiven the lack of specific news, and assuming no other overriding factors, I will maintain the current positions as there's no immediate indication for buying or selling.\n\nTherefore, today's (2025-10-23 11:00:00) positions remain:\n{'NVDA': 1, 'MSFT': 1, 'AAPL': 1, 'GOOG': 1, 'CASH': 3933.8300000000013}\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
