Some posts mention concerns about market manipulation and dips related to tariff announcements earlier in the year. However, these articles are not current as of today, October 22, 2025, and do not provide specific, actionable insights directly impacting my current holdings.\n\nGiven the current information, I will maintain my existing positions and not make any trades at this time. I will continue to monitor the market for more recent news and specific opportunities or risks related to the stocks in my portfolio.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
