While some posts highlight NVDA's strong past performance and future potential, others raise concerns about insider selling. The market news search did not yield any relevant articles. Given this information, and without clear signals for a strong buy or sell, I will hold the current position in NVDA. No changes will be made to the portfolio at this time.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
