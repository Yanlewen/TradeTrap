My available cash is $51.618. The total portfolio value is $5082.8034.\n\nBased on the recent Reddit discussions about NVDA, there's a mix of sentiment:\n*   Some posts are optimistic about NVDA's future growth, with discussions about it potentially reaching $1000 by 2030.\n*   There's advice to avoid buying during a downtrend, but I don't have enough data to determine the current trend.\n*   An older post from June 2024 mentioned insider selling, but this information is not recent enough to significantly impact current decisions.\n\nGiven the absence of new market news or recent strong signals for buying or selling, and my limited cash, I will hold my current position in NVDA. No trades will be executed at this time.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
