He asked if it's possible to get to 10M through \"Regular stock investments\". This is actually a question I've been asked many times.\n\nMy short answer is that it is ABSOLUTELY possible - but it takes time and patience.\n\nFor me it took 24 years with a one-time contribution of $321k on my newly opened online brokerage account. Those were my savings including interests, dividends etc. \n\nSince my early teens and all the way through my 20’s I worked multiple factory-, office- and sales jobs putting money aside every month. Pror to transferring  the funds to my online brokerage account my bank had managed my savings for all those years.\n\nI would definitely say that the profits I have gained in the past 24 years was achieved through “regular stock investments”, rather than options, penny- or MEME stocks etc.  \n\nI even failed at some wins that many would consider the most obvious ones so before sharing what was the 5 most important steps I took to reach 10M, let me show you how big you can fail and still end up successful.\n\nOther than getting PLTR right recently, I have been a terrible momentum investor. I missed most of the MAG7 except AAPL ($540k profits). Here is how poorly I handled some names, that I never managed to get back in to:\n\n\\- AMZN - I sold on May 7, 2010  \n\\- MSFT - I sold on Oct 19, 2001  \n\\- NVDA - I sold on Mar 1, 2023\n\nThe rest of the MAG7 never made it into my portfolio. So while I’ve done well in value investing, I’ve clearly been an amateur at valuing growth stocks. Had I held those positions, I would likely be on my way to 15M now.\n\nAnyway what we can learn from this is that you can still become successful even if you are not able to pick the biggest winners. I, myself just have to accept I am a better value / deep value investor than a momentum investor - but i'm still working on it and lately I finally got a hit with PLTR (Profit 800K).\n\nAnyway here is a couple of rules/guidelines that w\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i_allind_and_held_400k_in_uvix_for_6_months_i/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months.

It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.\n\nAs many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent \"Yen Carry Trade\" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.\n\nLast year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.\n\n\\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.\n\n\\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.\n\n\\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work.

Still, we have to acknowledge that the bull market we have experienced over the past 16 years has produced remarkable results for many investors.\n\nI do believe this bull market may continue for some years to come. There are several reasons for that—one being that never in history has so much NEW money flowed into markets worldwide every year.\n\nI’m convinced will last for quite a while, both due to the wealth being created in the developed world and due to the growing middle class in multiple developing countries—but that’s another story for another post.\n\nI didn’t have a financial background and only studied another three years after secondary school. Rather than spending too much time on Game Boy, TikTok, and Netflix, I have spent thousands of hours reading about investing, researching companies, participating in online investment forums, and watching CNBC and Bloomberg TV.\n\nUnless a person has the passion and the time on their hands to do something similar, I personally believe that it’s much better to invest your hard-earned money in ETFs or index funds rather than individual stocks.\n\nI know several investors whose objective is simply to work hard and feed their ETFs with cash every month—and they are doing really well performance-wise.\n\nSince 2001 I tried multiple investment strategies over the years. I failed miserably at day trading, and I still feel I have a lot to learn when it comes to momentum investing, so before getting into what works really well for me, I will spend a few words on what didn\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ly582b/14m_54m_in_18_months_85_in_cash_now/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $1.4m --&gt; $5.4m in 18 Months - 85% in Cash Now\nAuthor: u/Solid-Sock-1794\nScore: 17769 | Comments: 870 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-07-13 00:55:03\nContent: I've lost a lot of sleep over the past 18 months trading my mom's IRA (she's more than ok with this!), and I've been able to substantially outperform the market.  I lost most of her portfolio 3 months ago in April (bottom tick was $800k) but have been able to grow it back to a much higher value than it was before the tariff BS.\n\nTotal gains in 18 months: $4,000,000\n\nI have been trading options (obviously, this is WSB.) For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)\n\nMy strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.\n\nI generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.\n\nOn Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls. I think there will be buying opportunities soon given the new EU / Canada tariff news, but ultimately, as we all know, taco's gonna taco.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b93ybd/nvidia_nvda_stock_wait_or_sell/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock - Wait? or Sell?\nAuthor: u/Beginning-Cry7722\nScore: 155 | Comments: 278 | Upvote Ratio: 81.0%\nCreated: 2024-03-08 04:08:55\nContent: I don't invest much. but bought NVDA 2 years ago ..and well, it grew from 200ish USD to 900ish USD.\n\nIn the last year, I've been mostly investing in ETFs like VOO just because I don't follow business/investing news too much and ETFs seem easy. Anyway, I'm wondering if I should just sell all my NVDA  (15 stocks) and purchase VOO or SMH. Or do people think that this upward trend with NVDA will continue?\n\nI have a few other stocks like Apple, Microsoft, etc that I bought years ago and haven't touched since.\n\n**Update**: Thank you all for sharing your views. I'm a beginner and this really helps my learning. I decided to hold for a longer time, since I don't really need the cash for anything now and I don't have plans for the $ that I have in NVDA. However, I will continue to focus on the tech trends and the stock price changes and change my plans if I see it dip more than what I'm comfortable.
