This benefits our current concentration in AI infrastructure names.\n- NVIDIA (NVDA): Continued Blackwell platform traction; prior quarter showed strong data center revenue growth. A fresh headline notes the US considering broader software export restrictions to China, which could add headline volatility for large-cap US tech, though NVDA already had negligible H20 sales to China recently.\n- Broadcom (AVGO): Positive catalyst persists from the OpenAI collaboration for 10GW custom AI accelerators (reported 2025-10-13), supporting the AI custom silicon thesis.\n- Micron (MU): Strong AI memory/HBM narrative with record revenue and robust guidance cited in recent materials. HBM3E supply/demand balance remains tight and supportive for pricing.\n\nSocial/sentiment checks:\n- X/Twitter and Reddit scraping encountered access/availability limitations today; no reliable direct posts were retrieved. Given this, I relied on validated press/investor sources and recent coverage for decision support.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and actions\n- Cash is only ~$31, which is insufficient to add to any core position at current prices.\n- Considering the constructive AI-infrastructure backdrop and company-specific positives for NVDA, AVGO, and MU, and the cost of raising cash by trimming a strong name without a superior redeployment option intraday, I’m keeping the allocation unchanged today.\n- No trades executed.\n\nCurrent position snapshot (unchanged):\n- NVDA: 13 shares (≈ $2324.27)\n- AVGO: 3 shares (≈ $1015.81)\n- MU: 9 shares (≈ $1752.08)\n- Cash: $30.77\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ $5122.94\n\nPlan and monitoring\n- Monitor US-China policy headlines for potential tech volatility; reassess NVDA exposure if policy risk escalates materially.\n- Maintain watch on AVGO custom accelerator momentum and any updates from hyperscaler customers.\n- Track MU HBM capacity/pricing commentary for signs of further upside or supply tightness easing.\n- If we see a material pullback on non-fundamental headlines, consider raising cash by trimming one position to rotate into the most dislocated AI-infra leader (likely MU or AVGO) depending on relative setup and catalysts.\n\nNo trades placed today. Positions and valuations updated as above.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

While an unprecedented \"AI Supercycle\" is fueling explosive demand and record profits for companies at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) chip development, traditional market segments are experiencing a more subdued recovery, leading to significant stock slips for many chipmakers after their latest earnings reports. This bifurcated reality underscores a fundamental shift in the tech sector, with profound implications for innovation, competition, and global supply chains.\n\nThe immediate significance of these chipmaker stock slips for the broader tech sector is substantial. The weakness in semiconductor stocks is consistently identified as a negative factor for the overall market, weighing particularly on tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. This sliding performance suggests a broader underperformance within the technology sector and could signal a...\n\n\nURL: https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing\nTitle: NVIDIA Blackwell Platform Arrives to Power a New Era of Computing\nDescription: Powering a new era of computing, NVIDIA today announced that the NVIDIA Blackwell platform has arrived — enabling organizations everywhere to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: *   _New Blackwell GPU, NVLink and Resilience Technologies Enable Trillion-Parameter-Scale AI Models_\n*   _New Tensor Cores and TensorRT- LLM Compiler Reduce LLM Inference Operating Cost and Energy by up to 25x_\n*   _New Accelerators Enable Breakthroughs in Data Processing, Engineering Simulation, Electronic Design Automation, Computer-Aided Drug Design and Quantum Computing_\n*   _Widespread Adoption by Every Major Cloud Provider, Server Maker and Leading AI Company_\n\n**GTC—**Powering a new era of computing, NVIDIA today announced that the NVIDIA Blackwell platform has arrived — enabling organizations everywhere to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\n\nThe[Blackwell GPU architecture](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/ \"Blackwell GPU architecture\")features six transformative technologies for accelerated computing, which will help unl...\n\n\nURL: https://ceoworld.biz/2025/09/21/micron-technology-and-the-ai-memory-boom-a-2025-investor-playbook/\nTitle: Micron Technology and the AI Memory Boom: A 2025 Investor Playbook\nDescription: Micron Technology (MU) is scaling HBM production to dominate the AI era.

NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.\n\nThere were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.\n\nFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 72.4% and 72.7%, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter would have been 72.3%.\n\nFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.08 and $1.05, respectively.
