No clear near-term shock in this morning’s tape from macro to alter the AI infra thesis.\n\nInterpretation for the portfolio:\n- We’re concentrated in AI infrastructure (NVDA/AVGO/MU). Near-term catalysts and demand signals favor semis over mega-cap consumer/cloud on a risk/reward basis today.\n- AMZN had a strong print, but to concentrate capital in higher beta AI semi names through the cycle, I prefer reallocating AMZN exposure into memory (MU), which is a higher-operating-leverage AI beneficiary right now.\n\n4) Trades executed (using tool at today’s “buying” prices)\n- Sold AMZN 4 shares at 248.65 (open) to rotate out of consumer/cloud into AI memory\n  - New cash: 1,056.5406\n  - Positions: AMZN 0\n- Bought MU 3 shares at 226.90\n  - New cash: 375.8406\n  - Positions: MU increased from 4 to 7\n\n5) Update valuation post-trades (using current value prices)\n- NVDA: 10 × 202.78 = 2,027.80\n- AVGO: 5 × 376.45 = 1,882.25\n- MU: 7 × 224.06 = 1,568.42\n- Cash: 375.84\n- Total portfolio value post-trade ≈ 5,854.31\n\nPost-trade weights\n- NVDA ≈ 34.64%\n- AVGO ≈ 32.14%\n- MU ≈ 26.79%\n- Cash ≈ 6.42%\n\nSummary of rationale\n- Trimmed AMZN entirely into post-earnings strength to lean further into the AI semiconductor cycle where near-term demand visibility and pricing power (HBM, accelerators, networking) look strongest.\n- Added to MU on memory supercycle/HBM momentum, close alignment with AI accelerator demand, and improving sentiment.\n- Maintained NVDA and AVGO core positions given continued leadership in AI compute (NVDA) and AI networking/custom silicon plus VMware synergies (AVGO).\n\nRisk management and next steps\n- Current cash buffer ≈ 6.4% retained for flexibility and volatility management into upcoming data/events.\n- Concentration risk monitored: largest single-name weight is NVDA at ~34.6% (below a 40% soft cap).\n- Near-term watch:\n  - NVDA supply chain/lead-time updates, H200/GB200 ramp cadence\n  - MU HBM pricing/supply commentary and any new contract disclosures\n  - AVGO color on AI networking/custom accelerators and VMware integration KPIs\n  - Macro: labor/inflation prints that could reprice long duration assets\n\nFinal positions (after today’s updates)\n- NVDA: 10\n- AVGO: 5\n- MU: 7\n- CASH: 375.8406\n\nIf liquidity and price action remain favorable, I will consider:\n- Adding 1 share of NVDA on dips toward the 200–205 handle to increase AI compute exposure, or\n- Adding 1–2 shares of MU on any pullback toward ~220 to further leverage the HBM upcycle,\nwhile keeping total single-name exposure below 40% and maintaining a small cash buffer.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
