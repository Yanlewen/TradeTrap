Source: Yahoo Finance/Reuters recaps and sector pieces; LinkedIn commentary on TSMC Q3 2025 notes continued CoWoS constraints and strong AI-driven demand.\n- NVIDIA (NVDA):\n  - Ongoing narrative: Blackwell ramp tied to packaging constraints; export-control uncertainty around China-aimed variants persists, but long-term AI accelerator demand remains strong. Sources: Reuters historical reporting on China-aimed parts; sector commentary; packaging shift (CoWoS-L vs CoWoS-S) earlier in 2025.\n- Broadcom (AVGO):\n  - OpenAI custom ASIC engagement and networking roadmap remain key positives; Mizuho raised PT after the partnership headlines, though some analysis urges caution about overhyping the deal. Sources: Yahoo Finance PT note; Morningstar/MarketWatch commentary; Reuters on Broadcom’s new networking silicon.\n- Micron (MU):\n  - Continued positive sentiment on HBM3E/HBM supply and AI-driven DRAM bit demand. Multiple writeups highlight strong AI memory dynamics. Sources: Investing.com SWOT/context; broader sector uplift tied to TSMC outlook.\n\nStep 5 — Decision today\n- No trades. Rationale:\n  - The AI/semiconductor backdrop remains constructive with TSMC’s stronger 2025 outlook and persistent advanced packaging constraints favoring the AI supply chain.\n  - All three holdings (NVDA, AVGO, MU) are core AI infrastructure beneficiaries with supportive medium-term narratives.\n  - Available cash ($30.77) is insufficient to add meaningfully.\n  - While we could rebalance (e.g., trim NVDA to add AVGO), the current weights are acceptable and catalysts are broadly supportive across all three; no compelling immediate reason to incur rotation today.\n\nStep 6 — What we’re watching next\n- NVDA: Blackwell/H200 shipment cadence and any updates on China export variants; typical earnings window late November (monitor IR calendar for confirmation).\n- AVGO: Custom ASIC traction and networking share wins; next earnings likely early December per IR/events pages.\n- MU: HBM3E capacity updates and pricing; next earnings window around December per Nasdaq calendar.\n- Risk flags: Further US-China export restrictions, supply-chain slippage in CoWoS/HBM, or signs of AI capex digestion.\n\nPosition update summary\n- Holdings unchanged:\n  - NVDA 13, AVGO 3, MU 9\n  - Cash 30.7736\n- Portfolio value: 5244.2036\n- Weights: NVDA 44.96%, AVGO 19.72%, MU 34.75%, Cash 0.59%\n\nNo trades executed today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

(3-3)\n\nfollowing my previous post...\n\n🚀 In-Depth Analysis: Hidden Information in TSMC's Q3 2025 Earnings Report\n\nII. \n3. The 'Mild Recovery' Signal in End Markets\nNon-AI Market Bottoming: TSMC observed that the non-AI end markets (smartphones, IoT, automotive) have bottomed out and show signs of a mild recovery.\n\nStructural Significance: This is a positive signal for the broader semiconductor industry, suggesting that inventory correction is nearing its end. However, the growth rate and margins in these sectors will be vastly surpassed by AI and HPC, solidifying AI's status as the primary growth engine.\n\n\nIII. Mixed Analysis: Implications for Investors, Strategy, and Global Affairs\n\n1. Implications for Investment Experts: Value and Cycle Rebalancing\nGrowth Risk: While profits are record-breaking, the extreme growth rate (full-year revenue up nearly 35% YoY) creates a high-base effect, potentially leading to a sharp deceleration in the growth rate in the short term (e.g., in 2026). Investors must differentiate between short-term hyper-growth and long-term sustainable CAGR.\n\nADR Premium: The sustained high premium of TSMC's ADR over its Taipei-listed stock signifies that international investors are more optimistic about the AI-driven future, viewing TSMC as the biggest winner of the global AI spending frenzy.\n\n2. Implications for Global Strategy and Leadership\nStrategic Resilience: TSMC's leadership under geopolitical risk is validated by its financial discipline: maintaining high margins while expanding CapEx globally. This demonstrates that its technological leadership is robust enough to offset the rising costs associated with geopolitical hedging.\n\nIndustry Collaborative Leadership: C.C. Wei's emphasis on collaborating with over 500 customers and their downstream partners to negotiate demand two to three years in advance is a form of Collaborative Industry Leadership. This ensures TSMC maintains adequate capacity without over-expanding, preventing industry-wide capital misallocation.\n\n\n3. Extended Analysis of Technology and Supply Chain\nThe Criticality of CoWoS: The shortage of CoWoS capacity continues. Even as TSMC works to close the supply-demand gap, the advanced packaging segment remains the core constraint for AI chip delivery, continuing to benefit other associated supply chain partners.\n\nLimits of Silicon Content: The revenue surge is largely driven by increased silicon content (higher value per wafer). To maintain its long-term CAGR, TSMC must continue pushing breakthroughs in highly advanced nodes like N2/A16 to create new structural growth.\n\n\nConclusion: TSMC's Q3 2025 earnings report is an extremely strong result. Its greatest value, however, lies in confirming the long-term structural nature of AI demand, the persistent bottleneck in CoWoS, and the quantification of geopolitical risk—a report that must be interpreted through a five-year strategic lens rather than quarterly performance alone.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: TSMC Q3 2025 Earnings: AI Demand, CoWoS Bottleneck, and Geopolitical Risk | Eric Lee, Sales/Marketing/BD posted on the topic | LinkedIn\n\n===============\n\nAgree & Join LinkedIn\n\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_user-agreement), [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_privacy-policy), and [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_cookie-policy).\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brcmericlee_my-continuous-100-day-posting-day20-3-activity-7384779408647122946-eZbc#main-content)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/?trk=public_post_nav-header-logo)\n*   [Top Content](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_topContent)\n*   [People](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/+/+?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_people)\n*   [Learning](https://w...\n\n\nURL: https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/Earnings/Earnings-Dates/\nTitle: NVDA Earnings Dates, Upcoming and Historical Nvidia\nDescription: Find earnings announcements for Nvidia (NVDA).
