Not today, but trend supportive.\n- China/export context:\n  - Reuters (Apr 16): Prior mention of export restrictions issues for NVDA’s China-focused chips; but recent Blackwell/U.S. wafer news is constructive.\n- Social sentiment (X/Reddit):\n  - X results were generic; Reddit access constrained. No acute negative catalyst found for NVDA/AVGO/MU today.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Macro tailwind today (cooling inflation, rate cut expectations).\n- AI infra cycle remains strong: NVDA Blackwell progress; AVGO custom accelerators demand; MU levered to HBM3E/AI memory content.\n- Intraday weakness in semis (NVDA/AVGO/MU down) appears market-driven rather than company-specific negative news.\n\nStep 6 — Decision and actions\n- Constraints: Cash is only ~$30.77 — insufficient to add meaningful size.\n- Strategy: Do not sell into a broadly supportive macro/AI setup on a down morning absent negative stock-specific news. Maintain positions and reassess on strength or if new data emerges.\n\n- No trades executed today.\n\nStep 7 — Forward plan and triggers\n- NVDA: Positive on Blackwell ramp; would add on further pullbacks toward ~$175 if cash available or on confirmation of order strength/guide.\n- MU: Favorable HBM cycle; potential add near ~$200 if cash is raised; watch supply ramp headlines and ASP commentary.\n- AVGO: Custom AI ASIC momentum; consider adds sub-$340 or on updates about OpenAI/large customer ramps.\n- Diversification: Next deployable cash likely toward AI beneficiaries with durable cash flow (MSFT, AMZN) on dips, aligning with ongoing AI capex upcycle.\n\nCurrent portfolio after review (unchanged):\n- NVDA: 13\n- AVGO: 3\n- MU: 9\n- Cash: $30.77\n- Total value: ≈ $5,292.45\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
