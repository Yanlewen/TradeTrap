While a large payout, it offers clarity.\n  - Positive AWS outlook and upgrades tied to AI demand and capacity additions (Yahoo/Wells Fargo note 2025-09-27).\n- Micron (MU) / HBM landscape:\n  - Samsung reportedly secured Nvidia qualification for 12-layer HBM3E, adding competitive pressure (Yahoo report 2025-09-19).\n  - Micron’s structural demand trend remains favorable (DigiTimes: 2026 HBM sold out), but near-term share volatility likely as competition heats.\n- Apple (AAPL):\n  - iPhone 17 launch ongoing (Bloomberg 2025-09-19); no new negative data today. Mixed visibility on China demand; no actionable change.\n\nNote: Direct X/Reddit scraping faced access/blocks; cross-checked with Reuters, CNBC, Bloomberg, Yahoo, DigiTimes.\n\nStep 4 — Rebalance decision and execution\nRationale:\n- Trim MU modestly after a strong run and near-term competitive headlines (Samsung HBM3E qualification), while maintaining core exposure to HBM upcycle.\n- Add to AMZN to lean into improving AWS trajectory and regulatory clarity during an AI-led tech risk-on tape.\n\nExecuted trades:\n- Sold MU 2 shares\n- Bought AMZN 2 shares\n\nTransaction logs (executed via tool):\n- After selling MU 2: MU 7, Cash $477.2194\n- After buying AMZN 2: AMZN 10, Cash $32.7394\n\nStep 5 — Updated positions and current valuation (post-trade)\n- AAPL: 6 x 257.12 = $1,542.72\n- AMZN: 10 x 222.25 = $2,222.50\n- MU: 7 x 182.918 = $1,280.426\n- Cash: $32.7394\n- Portfolio total (post-trade): $5,078.3854\n\nStep 6 — Weights before vs after\n- Before:\n  - AAPL 30.4%, AMZN 35.0%, MU 32.4%, Cash 2.2%\n- After:\n  - AAPL 30.4%, AMZN 43.7%, MU 25.2%, Cash 0.6%\n\nWhat changed and why:\n- Increased AMZN weight to ride AWS acceleration and AI tailwinds with less overhang risk post-FTC settlement.\n- Reduced MU weight modestly to reflect higher near-term competitive risk in HBM while keeping core exposure.\n- Kept AAPL unchanged pending clearer data on iPhone 17 demand and Services trajectory.\n\nRisk management and next steps\n- Concentration remains in 3 names; monitoring:\n  - MU: Watch additional HBM share/qualification updates (Samsung/SK Hynix) and any CapEx or yield commentary.\n  - AMZN: Track AWS demand signals and any management commentary into earnings later this month/next.\n  - AAPL: Monitor early iPhone 17 sell-through (especially China), and Services growth commentary.\n- Cash buffer is minimal; no further adds unless we trim elsewhere or scale on pullbacks.\n\nCurrent positions\n- AAPL: 6\n- AMZN: 10\n- MU: 7\n- CASH: $32.7394\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
