Sovereign AI demand still robust. Earnings likely mid-Nov/late-Nov based on prior cadence. Some lingering U.S./China export control overhang remains a headline, but demand ex-China continues strong.\n  - Source snapshots:\n    - NVIDIA investor events page (Oct 2025 roadshows, reiterating AI momentum).\n    - Prior Q2 FY25 beat with strong data center growth and outlook for Blackwell ramp later in 2025.\n- Broadcom (AVGO)\n  - Custom AI silicon and Ethernet networking driving strong AI revenue growth; VMware pricing/licensing changes continue to face customer pushback but haven’t derailed AI growth story. Next earnings typically early December.\n  - Source snapshots:\n    - Nasdaq/CNBC coverage of 2025 AI-driven growth.\n    - VMware pricing changes content indicates customer cost pressure, but AI networking/custom silicon tailwinds are significant.\n- Micron (MU)\n  - HBM3E and datacenter DRAM/tight supply underpin bullish outlook; DRAM/HBM pricing remains firm as capacity prioritizes HBM and servers over PC. MU earnings typically in December for FQ1.\n  - Source snapshots:\n    - Articles noting upside from AI memory demand; industry commentary on DRAM/HBM price strength.\n- Sector backdrop\n  - Semi complex (TSMC, supply chain) supportive into year end given AI demand; analysts view sector resilience despite U.S.-China tensions.\n\nNote on X/Reddit: Direct live thread access is limited due to login blocks, but proxy sources and public articles suggest sentiment stays constructive for AI semis; no negative catalyst flagged today.\n\nStep 5 — Decision: adjust or hold?\n- Constraints: Available cash is ~$30.77, insufficient to buy a single share of any holding.\n- Concentration: Portfolio is 100% AI/semis (NVDA/AVGO/MU). While concentrated, near-term catalysts and fundamentals remain favorable into year-end (NVDA product cycle ramp, AVGO AI networking/custom silicon growth, MU HBM/DRAM pricing).\n- No degradation in thesis identified today; no opportunistic rebalance due to minimal cash.\n- Action: Hold positions unchanged today.\n\nPlanned actions and monitoring\n- NVDA: Monitor into earnings (expected Nov). Consider trimming only on extreme run-up vs. guidance to reduce single-name risk; otherwise maintain core.\n- AVGO: Watch for December earnings and any VMware churn impact vs. AI growth; on dips toward mid-320s consider add (if cash available).\n- MU: Into Dec earnings, positive HBM/DRAM dynamics justify maintaining exposure; on pullbacks toward high-180s would add (if cash available).\n\nSummary of today’s updated positions and valuation\n- NVDA: 13 shares, value ≈ $2308.24 (45.35% of portfolio)\n- AVGO: 3 shares, value ≈ $1012.32 (19.88%)\n- MU: 9 shares, value ≈ $1743.12 (34.22%)\n- CASH: ≈ $30.77 (0.60%)\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ $5094.45\n\nNo trades executed today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
