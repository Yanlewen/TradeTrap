This is still high but more balanced with an increased MSFT weight and removal of MRVL.\n\nWhat I’ll monitor next\n- Any escalation/de-escalation on China tariff headlines and potential knock-on to supply chains.\n- Follow-up reporting on NVDA’s customer Megaspeed probe.\n- DRAM/NAND spot pricing and any updates from MU ahead of next print.\n- AMZN tariff pass-through dynamics vs. category mix and gross margin resilience.\n\nFinal updated positions (from the trading tool)\n- {'NVDA': 6, 'MSFT': 3, 'AAPL': 0, 'GOOG': 0, 'GOOGL': 0, 'AMZN': 4, 'META': 0, 'AVGO': 0, 'TSLA': 0, 'NFLX': 0, 'PLTR': 0, 'COST': 0, 'ASML': 0, 'AMD': 3, 'CSCO': 0, 'AZN': 0, 'TMUS': 0, 'MU': 5, 'LIN': 0, 'PEP': 0, 'SHOP': 0, 'APP': 0, 'INTU': 0, 'AMAT': 0, 'LRCX': 0, 'PDD': 0, 'QCOM': 0, 'ARM': 0, 'INTC': 0, 'BKNG': 0, 'AMGN': 0, 'TXN': 0, 'ISRG': 0, 'GILD': 0, 'KLAC': 0, 'PANW': 0, 'ADBE': 0, 'HON': 0, 'CRWD': 0, 'CEG': 0, 'ADI': 0, 'ADP': 0, 'DASH': 0, 'CMCSA': 0, 'VRTX': 0, 'MELI': 0, 'SBUX': 0, 'CDNS': 0, 'ORLY': 0, 'SNPS': 0, 'MSTR': 0, 'MDLZ': 0, 'ABNB': 0, 'MRVL': 0, 'CTAS': 0, 'TRI': 0, 'MAR': 0, 'MNST': 0, 'CSX': 0, 'ADSK': 0, 'PYPL': 0, 'FTNT': 0, 'AEP': 0, 'WDAY': 0, 'REGN': 0, 'ROP': 0, 'NXPI': 0, 'DDOG': 0, 'AXON': 0, 'ROST': 0, 'IDXX': 0, 'EA': 0, 'PCAR': 0, 'FAST': 0, 'EXC': 0, 'TTWO': 0, 'XEL': 0, 'ZS': 0, 'PAYX': 0, 'WBD': 0, 'BKR': 0, 'CPRT': 0, 'CCEP': 0, 'FANG': 0, 'TEAM': 0, 'CHTR': 0, 'KDP': 0, 'MCHP': 0, 'GEHC': 0, 'VRSK': 0, 'CTSH': 0, 'CSGP': 0, 'KHC': 0, 'ODFL': 0, 'DXCM': 0, 'TTD': 0, 'ON': 0, 'BIIB': 0, 'LULU': 0, 'CDW': 0, 'GFS': 0, 'CASH': 18.163599999999633}\n\nIf you’d like, I can further cut semi exposure (e.g., trim AMZN or another semi and raise cash or add a defensive like PEP/AEP) depending on your risk tolerance for the tariff headlines.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Driven by the insatiable demands of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), the sector is on a trajectory to reach new revenue records, with projections indicating a potential trillion-dollar valuation by 2030. This robust growth, however, is unfolding against a complex backdrop of persistent geopolitical tensions, critical talent shortages, and intricate supply chain vulnerabilities, creating a dynamic and challenging landscape for all players.\n\nAs we approach 2025, the industry’s momentum from 2024, which saw sales climb to $627.6 billion (a 19.1% increase), is expected to intensify. Forecasts suggest global semiconductor sales will reach approximately $697 billion to $707 billion in 2025, marking an 11% to 12.5% year-over-year increase.

But on the seventh floor of Ocean Financial Centre, one office stood out for its silence.\n\nA self-described “premier business partner of Nvidia”, Megaspeed International showed no signs of activity when The Straits Times visited the office on Oct 10. Behind a locked glass door, the company’s nameplate still hung above the reception area, where two grey armchairs and some flowers stood. “It is always dark for as long as it has been here,” said a tenant in the building who was on her way to lunch. “I hardly see anyone visiting or in the office.”\n\nAnother tenant said he found it odd that any company would pay high rent for a prime office space, only to leave it unoccupied.\n\nMegaspeed, which bills itself as a specialised cloud computing service provider, appeared to have gone dark.
