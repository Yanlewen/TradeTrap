Positive for long-term DC GPU demand.\n- MU: Q4 commentary—HBM supply tight; 2026 HBM largely sold out; DRAM market tight into 2026; capex elevated. Positive structurally but stock was our largest weight, hence concentration.\n- MRVL: Ongoing AI optics momentum noted in recent coverage.\n- MSFT: Strong AI narrative (annual report), sustained Azure/Copilot momentum.\n- AMZN: AWS re-accelerating ~20% YoY; AI services and infra build-out ongoing.\n\nInterpretation: AI infrastructure cycle still strong. HBM supply diversification helps NVDA execution. AMD’s DC pipeline strengthens the competitive landscape, but NVDA remains the near-term volume leader for accelerators. MU outlook strong but became an outsized weight vs. single-name risk.\n\nStep 4 — Portfolio adjustment (executed via tools)\n- Sold MU 1 share to trim concentration and free capital.\n- Bought NVDA 1 share to increase exposure into Blackwell ramp and improving HBM supply backdrop.\n\nExecuted operations:\n- Sell MU 1 → Cash +$193.05 (opening-ref). New MU = 7.\n- Buy NVDA 1 → Cash −$188.59 (opening-ref). New NVDA = 5.\n- New cash ≈ $25.71\n\nStep 5 — Updated valuation and weights (post-trade)\nHoldings and market values:\n- NVDA: 5 × 188.5907 = $942.9535\n- MSFT: 2 × 524.05 = $1,048.10\n- AMZN: 4 × 226.44 = $905.76\n- AMD: 4 × 233.045 = $932.18\n- MU: 7 × 193.085 = $1,351.595\n- MRVL: 1 × 91.7005 = $91.7005\n- Cash: $25.7135\n- Total portfolio ≈ $5,298.00\n\nApproximate weights:\n- MU: 25.5%\n- MSFT: 19.8%\n- NVDA: 17.8%\n- AMD: 17.6%\n- AMZN: 17.1%\n- MRVL: 1.7%\n- Cash: 0.5%\n\nRationale for today’s rebalance\n- Trimming MU reduces single-name risk after it became the top weight, while its structural thesis (tight DRAM/HBM) remains intact.\n- Adding NVDA modestly increases exposure to the dominant accelerator platform into Blackwell ramps, with HBM supply validation tailwinds.\n\nNext items to watch\n- NVDA Blackwell shipment cadence and any China/export updates.\n- AMD MI325/MI350/MI450 customer deployment timelines and software ecosystem traction.\n- MU HBM3E/HBM4 ramp mix and DRAM pricing updates; any supply hiccups.\n- AWS/Azure capex commentary on upcoming earnings for AI infra spend pace.\n\nCurrent positions (updated)\n{\"NVDA\": 5, \"MSFT\": 2, \"AMZN\": 4, \"AMD\": 4, \"MU\": 7, \"MRVL\": 1, \"CASH\": 25.71349999999964}\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
