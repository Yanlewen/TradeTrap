Proceeding with provided buy prices as the executable feed.\n\n2) Market/news and sentiment check (X, Reddit, and news)\n- Broad market\n  - CNBC/Yahoo: US stocks near record levels; risk appetite constructive.\n  - ISM/PMI: Manufacturing PMI hovering above 50, indicating expansion.\n  - Yields: 10-year UST reference pulled from FRED; continued focus on rates but no major fresh shock today.\n- Key stocks/sectors\n  - NVDA: Mixed tone on X (Dan Niles): slight datacenter miss vs. very high expectations; guidance only modestly above. Favors selectivity in AI suppliers vs. NVDA itself today.\n  - AAPL: Multiple indications (DigiTimes via MSN; X chatter) that iPhone 17 early sales in China are exceeding expectations — supportive for Q4 seasonality.\n  - MU: Press notes record quarter driven by AI DRAM/HBM demand; X sentiment constructive on AI memory as a secular winner.\n  - AMZN: AWS AI buildout remains a central multi-year driver; recent reports highlight capacity expansion and Trainium adoption (longer-dated, but reinforces structural thesis).\n  - TSLA: Reuters indicates Q3 deliveries boosted near-term by EV credit expiry; strength may be transitory; we did not allocate today.\n\n3) Trades executed (using the buy tool)\n- Bought AMZN 10 shares at 219.68\n- Bought AAPL 6 shares at 255.53\n- Bought MU 6 shares at 176.522\n- Rationale\n  - AAPL: Momentum from better-than-expected iPhone 17 early sales (China) into holiday quarter.\n  - AMZN: Structural AWS AI tailwinds; diversified consumer + ads; quality compounder.\n  - MU: AI memory/HBM cycle strength, improving profitability, secular capacity tightness.\n\n4) Updated positions and valuation at today’s prices\n- Holdings after trades:\n  - AMZN: 10 shares\n  - AAPL: 6 shares\n  - MU: 6 shares\n  - CASH: 210.888\n- Position values at current buy prices:\n  - AMZN: 10 x 219.68 = 2,196.80\n  - AAPL: 6 x 255.53 = 1,533.18\n  - MU: 6 x 176.522 = 1,059.132\n  - Cash: 210.888\n- Portfolio total: 5,000.00\n- Weights\n  - AMZN: 43.94%\n  - AAPL: 30.66%\n  - MU: 21.18%\n  - Cash: 4.22%\n\n5) Risk management and next steps\n- Monitoring\n  - AAPL: Track China weekly sell-through and supply lead times through October; watch USD/CNY and any China macro curbs.\n  - AMZN: Watch AWS customer wins and AI workload commentary into late-October earnings.\n  - MU: Track HBM pricing, yield ramps, and capacity guidance across peers and supply chain.\n- Rebalance/trim triggers\n  - If any position rallies >10-12% quickly on headline momentum without fundamentals change, consider trimming to rebalance risk.\n  - If thesis breaks (e.g., AAPL China demand reverses; MU HBM capacity bottlenecks/ASP weakness; AMZN AWS decelerates unexpectedly), reassess allocations.\n- Cash: Retained ~4% to allow flexibility around earnings volatility and new data points (e.g., ISM/Payrolls/Fed speak).\n\nSummary\n- Built a concentrated, fundamentally supported mini-basket in AAPL, AMZN, MU aligned with near-term catalysts and 12-24 month secular AI/consumer cloud demand.\n- Will continue to scan X/Reddit and news for momentum inflection points and risk flags before adding or trimming.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I was wrong. In reality, they missed expectations of datacenter revs (though by just 1%) for the first time since the intro of ChatGPT in late 2022 and beat overall rev expectations by just 1%. This is despite 1) a write-down in the prior qtr which reset expectations lower, 2) taking the related H20 China revenue out of forecasts when they gave guidance for the July quarter ~90 days ago and 3) actually selling $650 million of H20 in Q2 to an unrestricted customer outside of China. Nvidia did guide revs ~1% above consensus for the upcoming October quarter despite no China revs being included. But now that guidance does not look as conservative given they missed the July quarter in datacenter. If geopolitical issues subside and Nvidia ends up shipping to China, they believe this should add an additional $2-$5B in H20 revenue in Q3 versus their guida...\n\n\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/\nTitle: \nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: You've been blocked by network security.\n\nTo continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer token\n\nIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.\n\n[Log in](https://www.reddit.com/login/)[File a ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=21879292693140)...\n\n\nURL: https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/becoming-frontier-how-human-ambition-and-ai-first-differentiation-are-helping-microsoft-customers-go-further-with-ai/\nTitle: Becoming Frontier: How human ambition and AI-first differentiation are helping Microsoft customers go further with AI - The Official Microsoft Blog\nDescription: \nPublish Time: 2025-10-28T16:02:35+00:00\nContent: Over the past few years, we have driven remarkable progress accelerating AI innovation together with our customers and partners.

(TSMC) continues to attract close investor attention amid surging AI-driven demand and Nvidia’s record highs.\n\n▪️ Stock performance: TSMC closed at $238.72, up 2.6% in the past week. Despite a 2.8% dip over 30 days, shares are up 18.4% YTD, 41.6% over one year, and 200.3% over three years. Five-year growth stands at 213.5%.\n\n▪️ Valuation: Simply Wall St’s analysis rates TSMC as undervalued in 4 of 6 checks, with a value score of 4.\n\n▪️ DCF model: With free cash flow projected to rise from NT$803.2B (last 12 months) to NT$2,203.1B by 2028, intrinsic value is estimated at $251.39 per share—about 5% above today’s price.\n\n▪️ PE ratio: TSMC trades at 21.1x earnings, below the semiconductor industry average (30.7x) and peers (64.3x). A “Fair PE” model suggests 37.5x, reinforcing undervaluation.\n\nBeyond metrics, analysts highlight the role of investor “Narratives”—outlooks on AI, margins, and industry dynamics—that can drive fair value estimates as low as $118 or as high as $629 per share.\n\nWith AI demand accelerating, how will TSMC balance valuation, growth, and global competition in 2025?\n\nThanks to Yahoo Finance for providing the full article with additional background, charts, and insights at the link below. 👇 \nhttps://lnkd.in/gXese_TM\n\n#ChipDesign,#SemiconductorManufacturing, #VLSI, #Lithography, #ICPackaging\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: TSMC's 2025 Outlook: How AI Demand Affects Stock Performance | Robert Quinn posted on the topic | LinkedIn\n\n===============\n\nAgree & Join LinkedIn\n\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_user-agreement), [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_privacy-policy), and [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_cookie-policy).\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertquinn2020_chipdesign-semiconductormanufacturing-activity-7366457247578689536-v_cW#main-content)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/?trk=public_post_nav-header-logo)\n*   [Top Content](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_topContent)\n*   [People](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/+/+?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_people)\n*   [Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/...\n\n\nURL: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-quarterly-deliveries-set-boost-expiring-ev-credit-us-2025-10-01/\nTitle: Tesla to book best quarter of 2025 as buyers rush before EV credit expiry\nDescription: Tesla is set to report its strongest quarter of the year on Thursday thanks to a U.S. rush to secure a $7,500 EV tax credit that expired earlier this week, but analysts expect the boost to be short-lived and European weakness to persist.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-01T10:02:43.124Z\nContent: Tesla to book best quarter of 2025 as buyers rush before EV credit expiry | Reuters\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-quarterly-deliveries-set-boost-expiring-ev-credit-us-2025-10-01/#main-content)\n\n[Exclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals Learn more about Refinitiv](https://www.reuters.com/differentiator/)\n\n[](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n*   [World](https://www.reuters.com/world/) \n\n[Browse World](https://www.reuters.com/world/)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n    *   [Africa](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/)\n    *   [Americas](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/)\n    *   [Asia Pacific](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/)\n    *   [China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/)\n    *   [Europe](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/)\n    *   [India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/)\n    *   [Israel and Hamas at War](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hama...\n\n\nURL: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/iphone-17-sales-exceeding-expectations-in-china-digitimes-reports/ar-AA1PMXoz\nTitle: iPhone 17 sales exceeding expectations in China, DigiTimes reports\nDescription: Sales of Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 in China have exceeded expectations just two weeks after its launch, providing strong momentum in China for Q4, a...\nPublish Time: 1762254911\nContent: ![Image 1: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](blob:http://localhost/a6ead9acc5af34cb22c78a05ed144ef7)\n\nMore for You\n------------\n\nMore for You\n------------...\n\n\nURL: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hbm-revolution-how-ai-transforming-memory-industry-iil9c\nTitle: The HBM Revolution: How AI is Transforming the Memory Industry\nDescription: High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) has evolved from a specialized component into the driving force behind a memory industry transformation.
