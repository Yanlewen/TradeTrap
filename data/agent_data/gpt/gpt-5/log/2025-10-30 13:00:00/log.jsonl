Rebalancing would be “sell one to buy one” with little net improvement and potential slippage. Options flow for NVDA is constructive; AVGO networking catalysts and MU’s HBM trajectory are intact.\n\nAction\n- No trades executed today.\n- Rationale: All three positions remain aligned with the AI infrastructure upcycle thesis. With minimal cash and no strong reason to rotate among the three, we hold.\n\nUpdated portfolio (post-mark-to-market, unchanged holdings)\n- NVDA: 10 shares, value $2,035.70, weight 35.19%\n- AVGO: 5 shares, value $1,884.35, weight 32.58%\n- MU: 8 shares, value $1,807.52, weight 31.25%\n- Cash: $56.14, weight 0.97%\n- Total value: $5,783.71\n\nWhat I’m watching next\n- NVDA: Any new developments on China restrictions vs. alternative demand offsets; November earnings guide/visibility for H200/B-series ramps.\n- AVGO: AI networking product traction and hyperscaler order commentary; fiscal Q4 outlook (seasonal timing).\n- MU: HBM supply expansion cadence, pricing, and 2026 capacity plans; DRAM/NAND pricing trends into 1H26.\n- Macro: AI server capex updates from hyperscalers during earnings season and supply chain (TSMC, CoWoS capacity, substrate, optics).\n\nNo position changes were made.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
