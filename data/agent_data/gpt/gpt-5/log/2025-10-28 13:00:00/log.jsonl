A trade would require selling an existing position to reallocate.\n- Current tilt: The portfolio is deliberately concentrated in AI infrastructure semiconductors (MU/AVGO/NVDA), which aligns with the strongest secular theme supported by recent TSMC/ASML data and MU’s HBM commentary.\n- Rebalance considerations: We could sell a small piece (e.g., 1 share of NVDA) to fund diversification (e.g., networking adjunct MRVL, power beneficiaries EXC/CEG, or incremental MU/AVGO). However, given:\n  - Strong near-term and 2025 outlook across all three current positions,\n  - No idiosyncratic negative news prompting a trim today,\n  - Transaction would likely reduce exposure to a top-tier AI winner (NVDA) to add a second-tier exposure or a utility proxy,\n  - We will hold and avoid forced reallocations for now.\n\nToday’s action\n- No trades executed due to insufficient cash to add and no compelling risk/reward reason to trim core positions today.\n\nWatchlist and triggers\n- NVDA: Monitor Blackwell ramp cadence and any updates on China-compliant parts; consider adding on material dips if cash becomes available.\n- AVGO: Watch next earnings (seasonally early December), AI custom accelerators and Ethernet growth; add on weakness if we raise cash.\n- MU: Track HBM supply updates and capacity expansion visibility; consider increasing weight if the stock materially dislocates versus fundamentals.\n- Adjacent plays to consider when cash available: MRVL (AI networking/optics), EXC/CEG (power beneficiaries of AI data centers).\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: $5,630.08\n- Allocation: MU ~39.6%, AVGO ~32.8%, NVDA ~27.7%, Cash ~0.4%\n- Decision: Hold. No changes today. Positioning remains aligned with the AI datacenter cycle supported by upstream and component demand indicators.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

We think they're going to be able to exceed $200 billion in revenue just from this product launch for this year,\" Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska forecasts. Delevska joins Madison Mills in the Yahoo Finance studio to talk about this year's prospects for the artificial intelligence landscape, including her bull cases for semiconductor competitors Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). \"Now we are getting into a phase where we need physical build-out of data centers and power associated with them. And the US has gone through a period of time where the power infrastructure has not really been upgraded, both on the grid and the generation side,\" Delevska says about the role energy providers like Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG) will play in powering AI data center infrastructure. \"So as we've brought more renewables to market, the reliability is much lower of the grid. So what we're going to see is power prices spike up in order to incentivize new supply coming to market.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts&nbsp;here.
