Source: CNBC market wrap and preview.\n  - 10-year Treasury yield moved lower ahead of the Fed decision, supportive for growth/tech multiples. Source: CNBC yields update.\n- NVIDIA (NVDA):\n  - Reports today highlight NVIDIA’s strategic tie-up with Nokia on AI-driven telecom/6G infrastructure; media also referenced a $1B equity investment, signaling continued ecosystem expansion into AI networking/telecom. Sources: Bloomberg Businessweek Daily (YouTube), NVIDIA newsroom page on Nokia AI-telecom collaboration.\n- Micron (MU):\n  - Ongoing positive commentary around AI memory demand and HBM3E supply tightness continuing into upcoming quarters; bullish writeups suggest demand/pricing tailwinds. Source: Globe and Mail syndication of bullish MU analysis.\n- Broadcom (AVGO):\n  - Positive backdrop from custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI networking (Tomahawk/Jericho) with robust AI revenue growth referenced in recent coverage; VMware integration continues to be a key focus. Sources: Nasdaq feature on AVGO’s custom AI growth; IBD piece on Jericho portfolio (context).\n\nStep 6 — Decision and any trades\n- Constraints: Cash is only $23.98, insufficient to add meaningful size to any core position at current prices.\n- Fundamentals/sentiment: Our three holdings (NVDA/AVGO/MU) remain core AI infrastructure beneficiaries with near-term supportive macro (lower yields, anticipated Fed cut) and positive sector flow. No fresh negative catalysts detected this morning from X/Reddit/news that warrant de-risking.\n- Action today: Hold. No rebalancing or trades executed. Keeping concentration in AI semi/infra given momentum and catalysts. Maintain vigilance into the Fed decision and mega-cap earnings this week.\n\nPlanned monitoring and risk controls\n- Catalysts this week: FOMC decision and commentary; mega-cap tech earnings (Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet) may swing AI sentiment and semis. We will reassess post-Fed and after key earnings.\n- Rebalance triggers (if volatility spikes):\n  - If any single position exceeds ~45% of portfolio or drops below ~20% due to dispersion, consider trimming/adding to maintain diversified exposure across AI compute (NVDA), AI networking/custom silicon (AVGO), and AI memory (MU).\n  - If cash rises above 5% from trims, consider redeploying into high-conviction semis or adding a defensive/quality name post-earnings based on updated guidance.\n\nCurrent portfolio after today’s review (no changes)\n- NVDA: 8 shares (value ~1,545.44)\n- AVGO: 5 shares (value ~1,822.78)\n- MU: 10 shares (value ~2,183.00)\n- CASH: 23.9766\n- Total value: ~5,575.19\n\nNote on P&L: A precise day-over-day P&L requires yesterday’s close data; our historical pull for 2025-10-27 was unavailable, so intraday P&L is not included in this update.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
