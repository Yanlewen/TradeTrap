Source: TrendForce (2025-09-10).\n  - Broadcom custom silicon momentum continues (headline $10B+ custom chip deals) — positive for AVGO’s AI/custom ASIC business. Source: InvestorPlace (2025-09-14).\n  - Macro/indices: Market rebound noted into Oct 23 session; broader risk tone constructive. Source: CNBC (2025-10-22/23 update).\n- Company-specific\n  - NVDA: Ongoing strong AI demand narrative from earlier in 2025 (Jensen’s 3-year AI spend outlook). Near-term, reports of China tightening checks on Nvidia AI chips at ports (potentially a modest headwind to any gray-market flows; direct China-restricted SKUs are already curtailed). Sources: IO Fund (2025-03-20), Reuters/FT (2025-10-10).\n  - MU: FQ4 FY25 materials reinforce AI memory upcycle and HBM3E ramp; pricing and mix supportive into FY26. Source: Micron investor deck (2025-09-23).\n  - AVGO: Continued AI networking/custom silicon strength post-VMware integration; secular story intact per custom silicon news. Source: InvestorPlace (2025-09-14).\n- Social sentiment\n  - Attempted Reddit and X/Twitter pulls for NVDA/MU/AVGO sentiment; direct content blocked/limited by site access controls in our environment. Initiated these checks as part of the process even though results were restricted.\n\nStep 6 — Assessment and decision\n- Concentration: The portfolio is 99.4% invested across three AI/semiconductor names with minimal cash. We are highly concentrated but aligned with the AI data center and HBM upcycle.\n- Near-term catalysts: No immediate earnings prints at this hour; secular backdrops remain constructive (TSMC packaging ramp, AI memory demand, AVGO custom silicon). NVDA China-port checks present a modest watch item but not a thesis breaker.\n- Liquidity: With only ~$30 cash, we cannot add to any positions. Any reshuffle would require selling an existing position.\n\nDecision: Hold positions, no trades today.\n- Rationale: Positive-to-constructive fundamentals across all three names; minimal cash; no strong adverse catalyst requiring de-risking. Avoid unnecessary churn in a concentrated, secularly favored basket.\n\nStep 7 — What we’ll monitor next\n- NVDA: Supply chain updates (GB200/NVL, Blackwell timing), hyperscaler capex commentary, export-control developments.\n- MU: HBM3E capacity and pricing updates; any guidance revisions on bit supply/tightness.\n- AVGO: AI networking demand and additional custom silicon wins; integration updates.\n- Sector: TSMC packaging capacity ramp execution; any macro risk-off shifts.\n\nOperations executed\n- No buy/sell operations executed today.\n\nCurrent positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 13\n- AVGO: 3\n- MU: 9\n- Cash: $30.77\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
