Not a fundamental Azure/Copilot demand issue, but headline/antitrust overhang exists.\n\nMacro: CPI calendar referenced (BLS schedule page). No specific CPI datapoint confirmed here; still monitoring. Tech/AI complex has been sensitive to macro and AI-cycle headlines.\n\nStep 4) Trades executed (with rationale)\n- Buy AVGO 1 share at 341.74\n  - Rationale: Positive, tangible AI accelerator + networking pipeline (OpenAI deal). Relative valuation support versus peers given secured multiyear demand.\n- Sell MSFT 1 share at 509.94\n  - Rationale: Trim on headline antitrust overhang while maintaining a sizable core position (still long-term constructive on Azure/Copilot).\n- Buy NVDA 1 share at 181.14\n  - Rationale: Tactical add on weakness vs mark-to-market reference; long-term AI leadership intact despite cyclical chatter about Blackwell timing.\n- Buy AVGO 1 share at 341.74\n  - Rationale: Further increase AVGO weight to balance the portfolio toward AI hardware/networking beneficiaries with new multi-year visibility.\n\nStep 5) Post-trade positions and cash\nFinal holdings after the above four trades:\n- NVDA: 5\n- MSFT: 2\n- AVGO: 4\n- MU: 9\n- Cash: 136.9436\n\nStep 6) Post-trade valuation and weights\n- Using current reference prices:\n  - NVDA: 5 x 188.32 = 941.60\n  - MSFT: 2 x 513.97 = 1,027.94\n  - AVGO: 4 x 356.68 = 1,426.72\n  - MU: 9 x 192.71 = 1,734.39\n  - Cash: 136.94\n- Portfolio total (post-trade): 5,267.59\n\n- Weights (post-trade)\n  - NVDA: 17.9%\n  - MSFT: 19.5%\n  - AVGO: 27.1%\n  - MU: 32.9%\n  - Cash: 2.6%\n\nNotes and next steps\n- We are now more deliberately tilted to AI hardware beneficiaries with clearer multi-year visibility (AVGO, MU), while maintaining NVDA exposure and trimming MSFT modestly on legal overhang headlines.\n- Risk: Portfolio is concentrated in semiconductors/AI. Monitor:\n  - CPI/Fed path sensitivity for high-duration tech.\n  - NVDA product-cycle headlines (GB200/Blackwell) and supply chain.\n  - AVGO integration/profitability execution on custom accelerators and networking demand.\n  - MU HBM pricing/supply cadence into 2026.\n  - MSFT legal/regulatory developments vs. AI pricing.\n\nCurrent positions summary (end of update)\n- NVDA: 5\n- MSFT: 2\n- AVGO: 4\n- MU: 9\n- Cash: 136.9436\n- Portfolio total (mark-to-market): 5,267.59\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

One need only look at the results of beleaguered Intel, which does not really have much of an AI play at all, to see what we mean.\n\nThe good news for memory and flash maker Micron Technology is that over the past several years it has come up with several AI plays, and its business is benefitting from that.\n\nMicron has become a third – and now significant – supplier for the HBM stacked memory that is used with GPU and other kinds of AI accelerators.
