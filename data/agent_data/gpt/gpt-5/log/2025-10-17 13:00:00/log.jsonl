{"signature": "gpt-5", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here’s today’s analysis and portfolio update for 2025-10-17 13:00:00.\n\nStep 1 — Read positions and today’s prices\n- Current positions (shares): NVDA 13, AVGO 4, MU 7, MRVL 1, CASH $0.85\n- Today’s open prices confirmed via tool:\n  - NVDA: $182.44\n  - AVGO: $347.61\n  - MU: $198.43\n  - MRVL: $87.43\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation and weights\n- Position market values at 13:00 (using today’s open):\n  - NVDA: 13 x 182.44 = $2,371.72\n  - AVGO: 4 x 347.61 = $1,390.44\n  - MU: 7 x 198.43 = $1,389.01\n  - MRVL: 1 x 87.43 = $87.43\n  - Cash: $0.85\n- Total portfolio value: $5,239.45\n- Weights:\n  - NVDA: 45.27%\n  - AVGO: 26.55%\n  - MU: 26.50%\n  - MRVL: 1.67%\n  - Cash: 0.02%\n\nStep 3 — Fresh news and sentiment check (X/Twitter, Reddit, and web)\n- Nvidia (NVDA):\n  - Axios/Reuters via WHTC report: Nvidia and TSMC unveiled the first U.S.-made Blackwell wafer today, a positive signal for onshoring and supply resiliency for Blackwell AI chips.\n  - X post referencing Techmeme confirms the Axios item; sentiment skewed positive around Blackwell and domestic manufacturing.\n- Broadcom (AVGO):\n  - Yahoo Finance recap: Broadcom showcasing major product advancements in AI networking at OCP Global Summit (Oct 13–17). Reinforces AVGO’s leadership in scale-up and scale-out AI networking (Tomahawk/Spectrum families, optics).\n- Micron (MU):\n  - Recent analysis pieces emphasize strong HBM3E tailwinds and tight DRAM/NAND conditions supporting pricing, margins, and FY25-26 outlook. No fresh negative catalyst today; sector demand backdrop remains constructive.\n- Marvell (MRVL):\n  - Ongoing narrative: AI infrastructure exposure (optics/custom accelerators). No adverse headlines today; tone is constructive for AI networking/optics.\n- Sector backdrop:\n  - TSMC posted record sales (LTM) on AI demand; advanced nodes ramping quickly (supportive for NVDA ecosystem and related suppliers).\n  - Separate note: China expanded export controls in Oct 2025 on certain materials; monitoring needed, but today’s NVDA/TSMC U.S.-made wafer news offsets some geopolitical/supply risk concerns for the NVDA chain.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and rationale\n- Constraints: Cash is $0.85 — no ability to add without selling. Any rebalancing would require selling existing positions.\n- Fundamentals and sentiment today are net positive for the AI semiconductor stack:\n  - NVDA: Positive Blackwell/U.S. wafer news; core AI compute leader with strong near-term fundamentals.\n  - AVGO: Leadership in AI networking affirmed at OCP; demand backdrop solid across hyperscale build-outs.\n  - MU: Benefiting from HBM3E, DRAM/NAND tightness; cycle still favorable.\n  - MRVL: AI infrastructure tailwinds; albeit a small position.\n- Given the positive news flow and lack of a new adverse catalyst, I will hold the current allocations and avoid forced sales purely to deploy small sums. The portfolio is already tilted to the higher-conviction themes within AI compute, memory, and networking, and weights are reasonable.\n\nAction: No trades today. Positions remain unchanged.\n\nStep 5 — What I’m monitoring next\n- NVDA: Blackwell production/ramp updates, next earnings date/guide; U.S.-China export policy developments.\n- AVGO: Customer adoption and product traction from OCP announcements translating to orders/revenue.\n- MU: HBM3E supply allocation, DRAM/NAND pricing trajectory into CYQ4/CYQ1; inventory levels.\n- MRVL: Hyperscaler design wins in optics/custom silicon; any near-term guidance updates.\n- Macro/sector: SOX performance, TSMC production capacity/packaging constraints, any further export control shifts (U.S. or China).\n\nCurrent positions after today’s update (unchanged):\n- {'NVDA': 13, 'AVGO': 4, 'MU': 7, 'MRVL': 1, 'CASH': 0.8486}\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The surge was driven by strong global demand for advanced chips used in AI and high-performance computing.\n\nTSMC's Q3-FY25 sales beat estimates amid strong AI chip demand, with September revenue up 31.4% YoY. The street is estimating double-digit topline growth to continue in the upcoming years under strong AI demand. The market is forecasting WFE (wafer fab equipment) growth to $122 billion in FY26 as TSMC is capturing market share due to AI accelerators.\n\nThe premium pricing is boosting margins directly as Q2 actual gross margin hit 58.6% (beating guidance midpoint of 58%), and the operating margin hit 49.6% (beating 47-49%). AI chips from clients like NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) (H20, Blackwell) and Huawei (Ascend 910C using TSMC dies) are driving this growth. As per Counterpoint Research, TSMC's foundry market share jumped to 38% in Q2 2025 (from 31% YoY) based on AI demand on 3nm/ packaging like CoWoS.\n\nOverall, these revenue trends point to advanced nodes ramping quickly. For instance, 5nm in Q2-FY22 led to ~21% topline contribution and hit 36% by Q2-FY25. Whereas 3nm led 6% topline in Q3-FY23 and is on a stronger growth path (24% in Q2-FY25). \n\nMy take:\n\nTSMC has a client lock-in ecosystem of chips. \nHow? \nNvidia and Intel Corporation (INTC) rely on TSMC for core AI chips.\nThis client lock-in solidifies TSMC’s moat as clients like Apple (80% portfolio on 3nm) and Qualcomm (2nm launches) depend on TSMC's chip yield superiority (Samsung struggles with 3nm yields).\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: TSMC Sales Reach Record $116 Billion in Q3 2025 (LTM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported consolidated revenue of $115.6 billion (NT$3.63 trillion) for the 12 months ending Q3… | Dr Rudolf Mauch\n\n===============\n\nAgree & Join LinkedIn\n\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_user-agreement), [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_privacy-policy), and [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_cookie-policy).\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dr-rudolf-mauch-3547801_tsmc-sales-reach-record-116-billion-in-q3-activity-7382701962552578048-mj1u#main-content)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/?trk=public_post_nav-header-logo)\n*   [Top Content](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_topContent)\n*   [People](ht...\n\n2371.72\n1390.44\n1389.01\n{\"symbol\":\"NVDA\",\"date\":\"2025-10-17 13:00:00\",\"ohlcv\":{\"open\":\"182.4400\",\"high\":\"You can not get the current high price\",\"low\":\"You can not get the current low price\",\"close\":\"You can not get the next close price\",\"volume\":\"You can not get the current volume\"}}\n{\"symbol\":\"AVGO\",\"date\":\"2025-10-17 13:00:00\",\"ohlcv\":{\"open\":\"347.6100\",\"high\":\"You can not get the current high price\",\"low\":\"You can not get the current low price\",\"close\":\"You can not get the next close price\",\"volume\":\"You can not get the current volume\"}}\n{\"symbol\":\"MU\",\"date\":\"2025-10-17 13:00:00\",\"ohlcv\":{\"open\":\"198.4300\",\"high\":\"You can not get the current high price\",\"low\":\"You can not get the current low price\",\"close\":\"You can not get the next close price\",\"volume\":\"You can not get the current volume\"}}\n{\"symbol\":\"MRVL\",\"date\":\"2025-10-17 13:00:00\",\"ohlcv\":{\"open\":\"87.4300\",\"high\":\"You can not get the current high price\",\"low\":\"You can not get the current low price\",\"close\":\"You can not get the next close price\",\"volume\":\"You can not get the current volume\"}}\n\nURL: https://whtc.com/2025/10/17/nvidia-and-tsmc-unveil-first-blackwell-chip-wafer-made-in-us-axios-reports/\nTitle: Nvidia and TSMC unveil first Blackwell chip wafer made in US, Axios reports\nDescription: (Reuters) -Nvidia and TSMC will announce on Friday their first completed U.S.-made wafer that will eventually become Blackwell chips for AI purposes, Axios reported.
