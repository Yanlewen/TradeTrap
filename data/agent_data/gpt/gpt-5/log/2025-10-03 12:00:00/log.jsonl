No contradictory sentiment trends surfaced via alternative outlets.\n\nInterpretation:\n- Favor AI supply chain beneficiaries with identifiable 2H25–2026 catalysts (MU: HBM ramp; AMZN: Prime event + retail strength; AWS leverage).\n- AAPL’s near-term catalyst path looks less clear; trim overweight.\n- Maintain a smaller NVDA position given long-term AI demand but acknowledge near-term power bottleneck risk.\n\nStep 4 — Rebalance actions executed\n- Sold AAPL 2 shares (to reduce overweight and free cash)\n- Bought AMZN 2 shares (into Prime Big Deal Days)\n- Bought MU 1 share (reinforce HBM/AI memory exposure)\n\nExecution details (via trade tools, using current buy prices):\n- Sell AAPL 2 → Cash +$516.8262; CASH moved to 654.2056\n- Buy AMZN 2 @ 222.68 → -$445.36; CASH to 208.8456\n- Buy MU 1 @ 190.55 → -$190.55; CASH to 18.2956\n\nStep 5 — Updated positions and valuation (post-trades)\n- Positions:\n  - NVDA: 3\n  - AAPL: 4\n  - AMZN: 9\n  - MU: 8\n  - CASH: 18.2956\n- Mark-to-market using today’s reference prices:\n  - NVDA: 3 × 189.00 = 567.00\n  - AAPL: 4 × 258.405 = 1,033.62\n  - AMZN: 9 × 222.69 = 2,004.21\n  - MU: 8 × 190.5885 = 1,524.708\n  - Cash: 18.2956\n- Total portfolio ≈ 5,147.83\n- Post-trade weights:\n  - NVDA: 11.0%\n  - AAPL: 20.1%\n  - AMZN: 38.9%\n  - MU: 29.6%\n  - Cash: 0.4%\n\nWhy this adjustment\n- Trimmed AAPL due to mixed near-term catalysts and to fund higher-conviction near-term opportunities.\n- Increased AMZN ahead of Prime Big Deal Days (near-term retail catalyst; Q4 positioning).\n- Added MU on the AI memory/HBM supply tightness and pricing tailwinds into 2026.\n- Maintained a modest NVDA stake acknowledging long-term AI upside but near-term deployment/power constraints.\n\nWhat I’m watching next\n- AMZN: early reads on Prime event (conversion, category strength).\n- MU: HBM3E supply commentary and any updates on allocation to Blackwell partners.\n- NVDA: datacenter power availability, any updates on customer deployment pacing.\n- AAPL: confirmation (or not) of October product event; early iPhone 17 sell-through indicators.\n\nNo further trades recommended today. Cash remains minimal to stay invested into next week’s AMZN catalyst. I will continue monitoring X/Reddit and news for incremental signals.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Anecdotally, at a technology conference, a U.S. building products distribution company was tracking 90 “mega” data center projects under construction in the U.S. as of May 2025. Today, that number is 300 (the consensus definition of a mega data center is over 20 megawatts [MW]).\n\nFor the month of July, data center construction spend was about $41.0 billion, while all other office construction was at about $44.0 billion. As of the end of first-quarter 2025, 451 Research was tracking 2,776 operational data centers and 1,064 under construction in the U.S. These data centers aggregated nearly 40 gigawatts (GW) of operational capacity (the corresponding global numbers are 9,687 operational, 2,699 under construction, and 87 GW of operating capacity).\n\nWe...\n\n\nURL: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4814180-micron-the-underpriced-ai-memory-king-facing-a-quiet-supply-shock\nTitle: Micron: The Underpriced AI Memory King Facing A Quiet Supply Shock\nDescription: Micron reports record Q3 FY2025 revenue of $9.30B, driven by DRAM and HBM growth.

That is the key finding from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) latest jobs report showing only 22,000 jobs were added in August with nearly all industries remaining stagnant or in decline.\n\nThe goods-producing industries, including the construction and manufacturing sectors, lost 25,000 jobs. There were steep losses in the professional/business services and wholesale trade industries as well. The only industries that experienced healthy job gains were healthcare, leisure and hospitality.\n\nSince the administration’s April 11th announcement of its so-called [“Liberation Day”](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-09-17/trump-tariffs-liberation-day-is-an-increasingly-costly-mistake) and the imposition of an unprecedented tariff policy, the production and logistics industries have lost almost 100,000 jobs.\n\nIt also appears the economy was far weaker going into that system shock than had been previously understood.
