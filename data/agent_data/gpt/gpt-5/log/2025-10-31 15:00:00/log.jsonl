BNN also notes CEO hopes Blackwell chips can be sold in China, with decision pending U.S. administration. This is supportive of continued demand but introduces policy risk (export decisions).\n- HBM supply/demand: Reuters (May 2024) indicated HBM supply for 2025 is largely sold out (SK Hynix), which supports tight supply and strong pricing; positive readthrough to Nvidia’s ecosystem and memory suppliers including Micron (MU).\n- Micron (MU): Reuters (Oct 2025) reports Micron exiting server chips business in China post-ban; localized negative, but HBM3E ramp is a key offset and global AI demand trend remains constructive.\n- Broadcom (AVGO): Continues to be a critical AI networking/custom silicon provider; sentiment from analyst chatter points to focusing AI exposure on leaders (NVDA, AVGO, AMD), with some caution that “good news may be priced in” (valuation sensitivity).\n- Broader semi tape: Couldn’t retrieve live SOX detail from Reuters/Yahoo links, but no negative headlines today that change the medium-term AI infra thesis.\n\nStep 5 — Decision and rebalancing\n- Assessment:\n  - Positive catalysts: Nvidia’s SK deals support global AI infra buildout; HBM supply tightness is supportive for MU pricing/margins; AVGO continues to benefit from AI networking and custom silicon demand.\n  - Risks: Potential U.S.-China export decision affecting NVDA Blackwell sales; valuation sensitivity across AI leaders; macro tape/voter-policy risk.\n  - Portfolio: Already tightly focused on AI compute/networking/memory (NVDA/AVGO/MU). Cash is limited at $169.37, which constrains adding meaningful size in core names. Small adds (e.g., 1 share MRVL or 3 shares ON) would not materially shift risk/return and could over-diversify away from the core high-conviction basket or add names with mixed recent outlooks.\n- Action today: Hold; no trades. Maintain cash buffer ahead of policy headlines and into upcoming catalysts.\n\nCurrent positions after today’s review (unchanged):\n- NVDA: 11\n- AVGO: 5\n- MU: 7\n- CASH: 169.37\n\nMonitoring/next steps\n- Watch for any official decision/headline on Blackwell export policy to China (NVDA).\n- Track HBM3E ramp commentary from MU and supply updates from SK Hynix/Samsung.\n- Consider incremental adds on pullbacks in core names (NVDA, AVGO, MU) that meaningfully improve risk/reward or if cash balance increases.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
