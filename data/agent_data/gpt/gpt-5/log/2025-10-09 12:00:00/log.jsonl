This is a headline risk for AI/semis, but not a confirmed change today.\n- HBM/AI supply chain: Continued industry discussion on HBM capacity expansion and AI infrastructure buildouts (supportive for MU and broader AI complex).\n- AMZN retail event: Facteus posted a wrap-up for Fall Prime event (suggests measurable activity); details not fully visible via scraper, but implies consumer spend data tracked the event.\n- MSFT/AI PC: Ongoing AI stack momentum commentary persists; no negative datapoint today via our pulls.\n- No credible, same-day negative catalysts specific to our held tickers were found.\n\nStep 5 — Decision and adjustments\n- Constraints: Cash is minimal ($26.38), insufficient to add to core positions. Selling small lots (e.g., 1 share MRVL) would not fund a meaningful increase in core names (NVDA/AMD/MU/AMZN/MSFT) at current prices.\n- Strategy: Maintain current allocation. Near-term catalysts include big-cap tech earnings later in October and macro (Sept CPI on Oct 24). Semi headline risk is noted, but AI demand and HBM trends remain supportive. No rebalance today.\n\nActions executed\n- No trades executed. Positions remain unchanged.\n\nUpdated positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA 6, MSFT 2, AMZN 4, AMD 4, MU 6, MRVL 1, Cash $26.38\n- Total portfolio value: $5,311.54\n\nNotes/Watchlist\n- Monitor: U.S.-China export control developments; Sept CPI (Oct 24); earnings windows for MSFT/AMZN/AMD; MU industry commentary on HBM; NVDA supply cadence and hyperscaler capex updates.\n- If volatility spikes on policy headlines without fundamental demand change, consider adding to MU/NVDA/AMD on weakness if cash is available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Execution quality is reflected in FY25 financial and operational inflections and strengthened disclosure controls, while incentive alignment relies heavily on equity with explicit share-price hurdles. The principal yellow flags are outsized CEO grant values in FY25, the mid-year modification of performance RSUs to time-based vesting, and enduring governance concentration through B shares.
