Positive for MU.\n- Nvidia/packaging supply:\n  - Ongoing industry chatter on Nvidia’s next-gen packaging (CoWoP) and continued advanced packaging constraints; generally supportive for AI semis demand (NVDA supply chain thematic intact).\n- Macro/consumer and AMZN:\n  - Adobe Analytics projects slower US holiday online sales growth (headwind for e-commerce). Mixed backdrop for AMZN retail; AWS remains the key positive, but near-term consumer softness is a risk.\n\nStep 3 — Pre-trade valuation using provided prices\n- NVDA: 3 × 184.95 = $554.85\n- MSFT: 2 × 523.97 = $1,047.94\n- AMZN: 5 × 221.80 = $1,109.00\n- AMD: 5 × 211.49 = $1,057.45\n- MU: 7 × 185.65 = $1,299.55\n- Cash: $48.04\n- Portfolio value (pre-trade): $5,116.83\n\nStep 4 — Rebalance decision\n- Thesis: Tilt slightly more toward memory (MU) given accelerating DRAM/HBM spot dynamics and potential margin upside. Trim AMZN marginally to fund the add (holiday growth slowdown risk on retail; AWS positive but we’ll revisit post-earnings).\n- Executions (tool-based):\n  - Sell 1 AMZN\n  - Buy 1 MU\n\nExecuted trades\n- Sold AMZN 1 share at system open price: $222.22\n- Bought MU 1 share at system open price: $192.84\n\nNew positions after trades\n- NVDA 3, MSFT 2, AMZN 4, AMD 5, MU 8, Cash $77.42\n\nStep 5 — Post-trade valuation and weights (using provided “value” prices)\n- NVDA: 3 × 184.95 = $554.85\n- MSFT: 2 × 523.97 = $1,047.94\n- AMZN: 4 × 221.80 = $887.20\n- AMD: 5 × 211.49 = $1,057.45\n- MU: 8 × 185.65 = $1,485.20\n- Cash: $77.42\n- Portfolio value (post-trade): $5,110.06\n\nWeights (approx.)\n- NVDA: 10.9%\n- MSFT: 20.5%\n- AMZN: 17.4%\n- AMD: 20.7%\n- MU: 29.1%\n- Cash: 1.5%\n\nNotes and next catalysts\n- Concentration: Semis now ~60%+ (MU/AMD/NVDA). This is intentional to capture AI/memory upcycle; will monitor for macro-rate volatility and any signs of HBM supply catch-up that could cap pricing.\n- Watch:\n  - MU/DRAM spot and HBM3E contract pricing trajectories (weekly/monthly reads).\n  - NVDA supply/packaging updates and export policy headlines.\n  - AMZN: AWS growth vs retail softness; holiday demand trackers.\n  - Macro: Next CPI print and 10Y yields for growth-stock multiple risk.\n\nSummary\n- Action taken: Trimmed AMZN by 1 share; added 1 MU.\n- Rationale: Strengthening DRAM/HBM price momentum and earnings power for MU; modestly reduce discretionary/retail exposure ahead of holiday uncertainty.\n- Cash buffer: ~$77 for flexibility.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Increasingly, performance gains are no longer coming from silicon alone, but from how chips are assembled and connected. A new packaging architecture reportedly under joint development by Nvidia and its supply chain partners has surfaced, sparking intense interest across the semiconductor and PCB sectors. The technology, known as \"CoWoP\" (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Platform PCB), appears to be the next evolution of CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate)—a packaging method currently used for Nvidia's top-tier AI chips, such as the H100 and H200.

Large parts of buy & sell-side as well as Fintwit. Do math for \"commodity\" DRAM margins. Assume spot goes sideways and contract (which lags spot) ~ catches up. If 100 price/50 cost = 50% GM. 200 price/50 cost = 75% GM (!). It's not surprising every time I turn around, any incremental price negotiations for HBM3e and HBM4 sound better. Have discussed varying fungibility timeframes between DDR and HBM as well as flash. Peak EPS power looks a little nutty. Again, normalized earnings matter as much. I.e. when there is a future downturn, will trough EPS also be higher?\n\n[![Image 1: Line chart titled DRAM Spot DR5x800/600 MHz displays price in USD on vertical axis from 5000 to 12000 and dates on horizontal...\n\n\nURL: https://apple.news/AvtFKX91KRmiGVhPjKF2kmw\nTitle: Fed keeps rates steady but pencils in two cuts by end of 2025; Powell sees 'meaningful' inflation ahead — Reuters\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: ![Image 1: Apple News](https://apple.news/images/Appicon_v6.png)\n\nOpening story…\n--------------\n\n[Click here Tap here](https://reuters.com/business/fed-set-hold-rates-steady-middle-east-crisis-tariffs-cloud-outlook-2025-06-18/) if the story doesn’t open after a few seconds.\n\n[Learn more about Apple News](https://www.apple.com/news/)...\n\n\nURL: https://www.actuarial.news/2025/10/08/daily-treasury-par-yield-curve-rates-7-oct-2025/\nTitle: Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates – 7 Oct 2025 – Actuarial News\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates – 7 Oct 2025 – Actuarial News\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to content](https://www.actuarial.news/2025/10/08/daily-treasury-par-yield-curve-rates-7-oct-2025/#content)\n\n[Actuarial News](https://www.actuarial.news/)\n\nAll about risk\n\nMenu\n\n*   [Public Pensions](https://www.actuarial.news/category/public-pensions/)\n*   [Mortality](https://www.actuarial.news/category/mortality/)\n*   [Public Finance](https://www.actuarial.news/category/public-finance/)\n*   [Investments](https://www.actuarial.news/category/investments/)\n\nDaily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates – 7 Oct 2025\n=================================================\n\nPosted on [October 8, 2025 October 8, 2025](https://www.actuarial.news/2025/10/08/daily-treasury-par-yield-curve-rates-7-oct-2025/) by [Mary Pat Campbell](https://www.actuarial.news/author/meep/)\n\nLink: [https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=202510...\n\n554.8499999999999\n1047.94\n1109.0\n1057.45\n1299.55\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giving-nvidias-blackwell-chip-china-204949665.html\nTitle: Giving Nvidia's Blackwell chip to China would slash US's AI advantage, experts say\nDescription: By Karen Freifeld (Reuters) -If the Trump administration allows Nvidia to sell a version of its best AI chip to China, as the President opened the door to on Wednesday, experts say it would severely\nPublish Time: 2025-10-29T20:49:49.000Z\nContent: Giving Nvidia's Blackwell chip to China would slash US's AI advantage, experts say\n\n===============\n\nOops, something went wrong\n\n[Skip to navigation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giving-nvidias-blackwell-chip-china-204949665.html#ybar-navigation)[Skip to main content](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giving-nvidias-blackwell-chip-china-204949665.html#nimbus-app)[Skip to right column](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giving-nvidias-blackwell-chip-china-204949665.html#right-rail)\n\n### [News](https://www.yahoo.com/)\n\n*   [Today's news](https://www.yahoo.com/news/)\n*   [US](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us/)\n*   [Politics](https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/)\n*   [World](https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/)\n*   [Weather](https://www.yahoo.com/news/weather/)\n*   [Climate change](https://www.yahoo.com/tagged/climate-change/)\n*   [Health](https://www.yahoo.com/news/health/)\n\n    *   [Wellness](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/)\n\n        *   [Mental health](https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/mental-...\n\n\nURL: https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-10-10-amd-delivers-leadership-ai-performance-with-amd-in.html\nTitle: AMD Delivers Leadership AI Performance with AMD Instinct MI325X Accelerators\nDescription: \nPublish Time: 2024-10-10T01:00:00\nContent: _─ Latest accelerators offer market leading HBM3E memory capacity and are supported by partners and customers including Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro and others ─_\n\n_─ AMD Pensando Salina DPU offers 2X generational performance and AMD Pensando Pollara 400 is industry’s first UEC ready NIC─_\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, [AMD](http://www.amd.com/)(NASDAQ: AMD) announced the latest accelerator and networking solutions that will power the next generation of AI infrastructure at scale: AMD Instinct™ MI325X accelerators, the AMD Pensando™ Pollara 400 NIC and the AMD Pensando Salina DPU.
