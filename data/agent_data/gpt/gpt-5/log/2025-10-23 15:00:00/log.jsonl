No changes executed today.\n\nRationale:\n- We attempted to source fresh sentiment/news and found no new adverse developments that would change the thesis.\n- With cash minimal, any buy would require selling a core position; relative outlooks remain strong across all three, and we avoid churn without a clear edge.\n- Maintain exposure to capture AI capex momentum into 2026; reassess around earnings/catalysts or if any single name drifts significantly off our target weights.\n\nStep 7 — Updated positions after today’s review (unchanged)\n- Positions: {'NVDA': 13, 'AVGO': 3, 'MU': 9, 'CASH': 30.7736}\n- Portfolio market value: 5,294.30\n- Weights: NVDA 44.9%, MU 35.0%, AVGO 19.6%, Cash 0.6%\n\nMonitoring and next actions\n- Triggers to rebalance:\n  - If any single position >55% or <15% of portfolio, consider rebalancing.\n  - New guidance/earnings: next updates from NVDA/AVGO/MU; watch for any confirmation or revision of 2026 AI demand, HBM supply, and China export approvals.\n  - If cash inflows occur or prices dip materially, consider adding:\n    - AVGO (AI networking + ASIC visibility),\n    - MU (HBM3E leadership into 2026),\n    - Select AI beneficiaries for diversification (e.g., MSFT/AMZN/GOOGL/AMD/QCOM) depending on valuation and catalysts.\n\nNo transactions executed today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Blackwell-driven Data Center revenue grew 17% QoQ, with Q3 guidance pointing to ~$54Bn.\n\n🎯 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬 𝐨𝐮𝐭  \n\nThe strong print comes with caveats. No H20 shipments reached China in Q2 despite select licenses. Instead, NVIDIA booked a $180Mn inventory release and ~$650Mn in unrestricted H20 sales to a non-China customer. For Q3, China shipments are excluded, though management flagged a $2–5Bn upside if approvals come through.\n\n🎯 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭’𝐬 𝐩𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡\n\nHyperscaler AI spend is the core driver, with NVIDIA projecting $3–4T in AI infrastructure investment by 2030. Gross margin guidance of 73.5% shows resilience even without China H20 revenue. Growth vectors are broadening—from robotics, where Jetson AGX Thor adoption is rising, to automotive, which climbed 69% YoY.\n\n🎯 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡\n\nGeopolitics looms large. China is a $50Bn AI compute market in 2025, growing ~50% annually. It also hosts half of the world’s AI researchers and leading open-source models.
