Positive for near-term demand and revenue visibility.\n  - Sector risk theme: One of NVDA’s big customers striking a “massive deal” raising in-house chip concerns (Motley Fool 2025-10-09). Longer-term margin/market share risk if hyperscalers accelerate internal silicon efforts, but not an immediate revenue hit.\n  - TSMC Sept revenue strong YoY (+31.4%, Focus Taiwan 2025-10-09), supportive for advanced node demand tied to AI supply chain including NVDA.\n- AMD:\n  - Multiple sources (Motley Fool 2025-10-09) note AMD stock strength this week on a new AI chip deal. Positive sentiment and potential incremental share gains in AI accelerators.\n- Micron (MU):\n  - No clear directional headline today; memory pricing/demand generally correlated to AI server builds. TSMC strength is supportive; no red flags found.\n- Marvell (MRVL):\n  - No reliable fresh headlines from our scrape (access limitations), but MRVL is levered to AI networking/optics. No immediate negatives seen.\n- Microsoft (MSFT):\n  - Microsoft Ignite security/AI content (MS blog 2025-10-09). Ongoing AI features momentum; no adverse items found.\n- Amazon (AMZN):\n  - Broader AI data center capex cycle remains constructive; in-house silicon trend is real (context from later reporting), but near term overall AI spend rising benefits cloud and semi ecosystems.\n\nStep 5) Decision and actions\n- Cash is only ~$26, insufficient to add any targeted names.\n- No compelling reason to trim today:\n  - Semi tailwinds remain intact (TSMC monthly revs strong; US export approvals favorable for NVDA; AMD momentum).\n  - The “in-house chips” risk is longer-term and is balanced by broader AI capex growth.\n- Hold all positions. No trades executed.\n\nStep 6) What I’m watching next\n- NVDA export developments and hyperscaler capex updates; any concrete customer in-house chip milestones that change NVDA’s medium-term demand profile.\n- AMD AI accelerator traction and any customer wins tied to the “unexpected AI chip deal.”\n- Memory pricing/bit demand commentary for MU into CQ4.\n- Macro: rates/energy impacting long-duration tech multiples.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: ~$5,278.22\n- No changes to holdings today; maintain overweight semiconductors given supportive news flow and cycle strength. Cash remains ~$26.38.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Now, the 1,200-acre site near Lake Michigan is home to one of the largest operational AI data centers in the world. It's called Project Rainier, and it's the spot where [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/) is training frontier artificial intelligence models entirely on its own chips.\n\nAmazon and its competitors have pledged more than $1 trillion towards AI data center projects that are so ambitious, skeptics wonder if there's enough money, energy and community support to get them off the ground.\n\nOpenAI has [Stargate](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/openai-first-data-center-in-500-billion-stargate-project-up-in-texas.html) — its name for a slate of mammoth AI data centers that it plans to develop. Rainier is Amazon's $11 billion answer. And it's not a concept, but a cluster that's already online.\n\nThe complex was built exclusively to train and run models from Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, and one of Amazon's largest...\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-09.
