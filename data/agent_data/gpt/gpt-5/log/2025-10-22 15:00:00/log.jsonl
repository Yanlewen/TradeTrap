MU remains buoyed by HBM/DDR5 strength and AI server build-outs.\n\n- Broadcom (AVGO):\n  - Continued narrative around custom accelerators/Ethernet for AI scale-outs; one article about OpenAI-Broadcom long-term collaboration (indicative of secular demand, albeit timing skewed to 2026+).\n  - No adverse near-term company-specific news identified.\n\n- Geopolitics/policy:\n  - Renewed discussion about US-China trade tensions/export controls—headline risk for the semi complex.\n\nStep 5 – Decision and actions\n- Constraints: Available cash is ~$30.77—insufficient to add any position.\n- Positioning view:\n  - Long-term AI cycle tailwinds persist for NVDA (accelerators/stack), MU (HBM/DRAM/NAND recovery), AVGO (custom AI accelerators and networking).\n  - Near-term: Market risk-off tone and SOX down; nothing in today’s tape or news that compels trimming our core AI semi exposure, given long-term thesis and no need to raise cash.\n- Action: Hold all current positions. No trades executed today.\n\nCurrent portfolio (post-update; unchanged holdings)\n- NVDA: 13 shares (≈ $2,325.31, 45.21%)\n- MU: 9 shares (≈ $1,771.83, 34.45%)\n- AVGO: 3 shares (≈ $1,015.08, 19.74%)\n- Cash: $30.77 (0.60%)\n- Total value: ≈ $5,142.99\n\nWhat I’m watching next\n- Policy headlines on US-China export restrictions (potential to impact NVDA and broader semi complex).\n- HBM supply/demand commentary and foundry capacity updates (TSMC/CoWoS, HBM3E ramps) that influence MU and AI supply chain.\n- Next earnings windows and guide commentary for NVDA/AVGO/MU regarding AI demand cadence and backlog.\n\nNo trades executed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
