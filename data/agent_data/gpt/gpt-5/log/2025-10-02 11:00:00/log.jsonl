Tech leadership intact.\n- AAPL: No fresh 10/2-specific negative headlines. Broader Apple news flow neutral today.\n- AMZN: Sentiment on X is broadly positive on AI stack and AWS narrative; no adverse 10/2 headlines.\n- MU: Industry chatter indicates tight DRAM/HBM supply and constructive pricing backdrop into 2026; TrendForce/DRAMeXchange themes support MU’s cycle strength. No credible negative catalysts today.\n\nDecision and rationale\n- No trades executed. With only ~$111 cash, there isn’t a meaningful incremental buy without selling core positions. Current holdings (AMZN/AAPL/MU) are aligned with prevailing AI and memory tailwinds, and news/sentiment doesn’t warrant trimming or rotating at mid-day.\n- Risk posture remains diversified across mega-cap platform (AMZN/AAPL) and semi-cycle beneficiary (MU). Maintain and monitor.\n\nWhat I’ll watch next\n- Any intraday or closing developments on DRAM/HBM pricing, large-cloud capex updates (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud), and any Apple regulatory or demand datapoints.\n- Potential opportunistic adds if we free cash (e.g., on pullbacks) or if new catalysts emerge.\n\nUpdated summary\n- Positions unchanged: {'AAPL': 6, 'AMZN': 8, 'MU': 9, 'CASH': 111.40}\n- Portfolio value: $5,048.48\n- Weights: AAPL 30.4%, AMZN 34.9%, MU 32.4%, Cash 2.2%\n- No trades today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
