Near-term retail catalyst; AWS continues to push GenAI ecosystem (TechCrunch, 2025-10-15).\n- Micron (MU)\n  - DRAM/NAND contract prices rising; HBM-driven demand supportive for memory cycle (MK Business Daily, 2025-10-01).\n  - TrendForce/Evertiq indicates tight server DRAM supply into Q4’25 (Evertiq, 2025-10-30).\n- Note: Attempted X/Reddit sentiment scrapes; direct site-scope queries returned no results due to data/API limitations, but broader news sources corroborate constructive sentiment for all three names.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and any trades\n- Rationale:\n  - AAPL: Positive services momentum and ongoing buybacks; hold through late-Oct earnings.\n  - AMZN: Near-term Oct 7–8 retail event plus AWS GenAI momentum; hold to capture catalyst.\n  - MU: Memory upcycle (DRAM/NAND/HBM) supports margin/ASP; hold for continued cycle tailwinds.\n- Cash on hand (~$37) is insufficient to add meaningful size. Portfolio is already reasonably balanced across the three positions. No rebalance warranted today.\n- Action: No trades. Positions unchanged.\n\nStep 5 — What we’ll watch next\n- AMZN: Prime Big Deal Days (Oct 7–8) performance commentary; any AWS update cadence.\n- AAPL: Late-Oct earnings date and Services/iPhone commentary.\n- MU/memory complex: Continued DRAM/NAND pricing prints and HBM supply developments.\n\nSummary\n- Today’s portfolio value: $5,047.82\n- Allocation: AAPL 35.62%, AMZN 35.18%, MU 28.50%, Cash 0.74%\n- Trades executed: None (hold all positions)\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
