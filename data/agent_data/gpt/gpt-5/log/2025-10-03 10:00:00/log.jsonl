Strong AI/HBM demand narrative persists; 2025 HBM largely sold out in prior coverage.\n- AMZN: Prime Big Deal Days Oct 7–8 could support near-term retail GMV; recent earnings (Oct 30) showed strong AWS growth. No acute negative catalyst today; some older EU regulatory chatter exists but not new for today.\n- NVDA: AI cycle backdrop intact. Direct social data limited due to access restrictions; however, long-term demand (Blackwell/HBM ecosystem) remains structurally favorable.\n\nNote: Reddit/X rate limits restricted granular sentiment posts, but we attempted multiple endpoints and captured key macro and company items above.\n\n4) Rebalance decision and rationale\n- Objective: Tilt slightly more toward pure AI semis at attractive prices, while trimming some AMZN exposure into event risk and to fund the pivot. Keep MU due to AI-HBM tailwinds and dividend already captured via ex-date.\n- Actions executed:\n  - Sold 3 shares of AMZN at $223.79 (open price).\n  - Bought 3 shares of NVDA at $188.91 (open price).\n\n5) Executed trades (tool-confirmed)\n- Sell AMZN 3 @ $223.79\n  - Proceeds: 3 × 223.79 = $671.37\n  - Cash after sale: $704.1094\n- Buy NVDA 3 @ $188.91\n  - Cost: 3 × 188.91 = $566.73\n  - Cash after purchase: $137.3794\n\n6) Updated positions and current valuation (marked to current “value” feed)\n- Positions:\n  - AAPL: 6\n  - AMZN: 7\n  - MU: 7\n  - NVDA: 3\n  - Cash: $137.3794\n\n- Mark-to-market using current “value” prices:\n  - AAPL: 6 × 257.14 = $1,542.84\n  - AMZN: 7 × 222.41 = $1,556.87\n  - MU: 7 × 183.6276 = $1,285.3932\n  - NVDA: 3 × 188.92 = $566.76\n  - Stocks subtotal: $4,951.8632\n  - Total portfolio value (incl. cash): $4,951.8632 + $137.3794 = $5,089.2426\n\n- Approximate weights (of total portfolio):\n  - AAPL: ~30.3%\n  - AMZN: ~30.6%\n  - MU: ~25.3%\n  - NVDA: ~11.1%\n  - Cash: ~2.7%\n\n7) Notes and next steps\n- MU dividend: We were holders through today’s ex-div date, so we should receive ~$0.805 on the Oct 21 pay date.\n- Near-term catalysts:\n  - AMZN: Prime Big Deal Days (Oct 7–8) may boost retail sentiment; we still hold 7 shares.\n  - Semis/AI: Watch NVDA ecosystem updates and HBM supply commentary; strength in AI data center capex remains the key driver for NVDA and MU.\n- Risk management: Portfolio remains diversified across consumer tech, cloud/retail, and semiconductors with a small cash buffer. Will reassess after Prime event and any new AI-capex headlines.\n\nOperations log (executed today):\n- Sold AMZN 3 shares\n- Bought NVDA 3 shares\n\nCurrent holdings summary:\n- AAPL: 6\n- AMZN: 7\n- MU: 7\n- NVDA: 3\n- Cash: $137.3794\n- Total portfolio value: ~$5,089.24\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

As of October 3, 2025, Bezos's long-held ambition for gigawatt-scale orbital data centers is gaining tangible momentum, driven by the insatiable energy and cooling demands of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. This bold vision, articulated as a natural evolution in humanity's space utilization, promises to unlock unprecedented efficiency and sustainability for the computational infrastructure of tomorrow, with profound implications for global financial markets and the tech industry at large.\n\nBezos's Vision Takes Flight: Blue Origin Leads the Charge into Orbital Computing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBezos's vision isn't merely theoretical; it's being actively pu...\n\n\nURL: https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/59248181/micron-technology-to-go-ex-dividend-on-october-3rd-2025\nTitle: Micron Technology To Go Ex-Dividend On October 3rd, 2025 With 0.115 USD Dividend Per Share\nDescription: October1st (Eastern Time) - $Micron Technology(MU.US)$ is trading ex-dividend on October 3rd, 2025.Shareholders of record on October 3rd, 2025 will receive 0.115 USD dividend per share on October 21\nPublish Time: 2025-10-02T09:00:00+08:00\nContent: Micron Technology To Go Ex-Dividend On October 3rd, 2025 With 0.115 USD Dividend Per Share\n\n===============\n\n![Image 2: share_log](https://newsfile.moomoo.com/news-thumbnail/20240724/public/17218233142306590440609-news-thumbnail/20240724/public/17218233142309442765222.jpg?imageMogr2/thumbnail/76x76!/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\n\n[](https://www.moomoo.com/sg)\n\n*    Investments \n\n    *    Securities    \n\n        *   [Global Stocks](https://www.moomoo.com/sg/invest/stocks)\n        *   [US Stocks](https://www.moomoo.com/sg/invest/us-stocks)\n        *   [SG Stocks](https://www.moomoo.com/sg/invest/singapore-stocks)\n        *   [JP Stocks](https://www.moomoo.com/sg/invest/japan-stock)\n        *   [HK Stocks](https://www.moomoo.com/sg/events/hong-kong-stocks)\n\n        *   [REITs](https://www.moomoo.com/sg/invest/reits)\n        *   [US Treasuries](https://www.moomoo.com/sg/invest/ustreasury)\n        *   [Regular Savings Plan (RSP)](https://www.moomoo.com/sg/invest/regular-savings-plan)\n        ...\n\n\nURL: https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-100325?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqco280GP7iK9yGgQYjj_tF7iE8zxckmPLJog5UNzr3qpdJq2GX6N-a3&gaa_ts=690faaac&gaa_sig=yLmG88avACCRCbTOGZdYsXJZfzQ5vzRdq1kIZNLvAlf7EAE3RNLPqasj-WoqHXqRqfd8kbyudpcrk6qN7FaU5A==\nTitle: Stock Market News From Oct. 3, 2025: Dow, S&P 500 String Together 'Perfect Week;' Nasdaq Dips; Shutdown Delays Jobs Report; Tesla, Nvidia, and More Movers\nDescription: The Dow and S&P 500 grinded higher, while the Nasdaq and tech stocks dipped.
