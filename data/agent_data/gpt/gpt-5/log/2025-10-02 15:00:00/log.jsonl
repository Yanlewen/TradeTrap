No fresh adverse items found today.\n\nStep 4) Decision and execution\n- Constraints: Cash is ~$33, insufficient to add shares. Rebalancing would require selling existing positions.\n- Thesis check:\n  - AMZN: Benefiting from AWS and ads momentum; still our largest weight.\n  - MU: Tailwind from HBM/AI memory cycle; supportive to maintain exposure.\n  - AAPL: Product-cycle tailwinds vs. regional demand risks; no immediate negative catalyst identified today.\n- Action: No trades. We maintain current allocations given positive market tone and lack of compelling, time-sensitive catalysts to rotate today.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: $5,089.64\n- Allocation: AMZN 43.7%, AAPL 30.4%, MU 25.3%, Cash 0.6%\n- Trades executed: None (hold)\n\nCatalysts to watch\n- AAPL: October product event headlines and any China demand reads.\n- AMZN: Q3 earnings commentary on AWS and ads.\n- MU: Any updates on HBM supply/pricing and data center demand; peer GPU rollouts.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

(Ticker: MU) recently gave investors a surprise. The company lifted its fiscal Q4 2025 outlook, calling for $11.2 billion in sales—about half a billion more than it had expected just weeks earlier. Gross margins are also moving higher, now projected at 44.5%. The reason? Stronger prices for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips and rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the kind of advanced chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nThat news sent Micron’s stock higher, extending a rally that’s already seen shares climb more than 40% th...\n\n\nURL: https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-government-shutdown-10-02-2025?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfBAPt0RFoT-Gh4M2Dw-7-GhJmr4Y_ah4PMrYHUbxIuObRIztHRXYtz&gaa_ts=690fa893&gaa_sig=g26TSTZQFUgOq2P0LlkFUWKeiF1qFUpCkUuS65Da1TcT_ihYHtcDNGjRedTgzO4_uFC3WLwKgse9e2LGZ80Nag==\nTitle: wsj.com\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: wsj.com\n\n===============...\n\n\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1y5cm/nvidia_ceo_huang_says_bringing_blackwell_ai_chip/\nTitle: \nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: You've been blocked by network security.\n\nTo continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer token\n\nIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.\n\n[Log in](https://www.reddit.com/login/)[File a ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=21879292693140)...\n\n⚠️ Search query 'site:reddit.com AAPL iPhone demand October 2025 discussion' found no results.
