We will not trim strong names absent a clear catalyst or valuation-driven rebalance need intraday.\n  - Note semis trade risk (rare earths/tariffs) as a watch item; will revisit if policy headlines escalate or pricing turns.\n\nWhat I will watch next\n- Earnings calendar updates for MSFT/AMZN (late Oct), NVDA (mid-Nov), and any MU demand/pricing updates.\n- Any concrete US–China trade measures affecting semi supply chains.\n- Intraday volatility; if we see outsized single-name moves, consider tactical rebalance.\n\nTrades executed today\n- None.\n\nUpdated positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA 3, MSFT 4, AMZN 4, MU 9, Cash $2.5336\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Trade and technology friction between the U.S. and China has intensified again, with former President Trump indicating his intention to impose “100 percent additional tariffs” on Chinese goods, raising fears of an exchange of trade measures. This tension has led to the collapse of the traditional trade regime, and it has been suggested that ASEAN and the EU should be targeted as alternative markets.

Instead of sputtering angrily over the depiction,[Bondi tweeted a screencap of the _SNL_ duo](https://www.cracked.com/article_48734_pam-bondi-shows-trump-administration-how-to-neuter-late-night-comedy.html) and asked Noem, “Should we recreate in Chicago next week?” Which is a post much more spiritually deflating than anything Trump could hope to drum up on Truth Social.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Chevy Chase’s ego will likely be inflated by his own version of events.
