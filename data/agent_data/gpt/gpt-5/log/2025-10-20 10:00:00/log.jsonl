Positive readthrough for the AI supply chain.\n- ASML: Reuters notes a strong EUV order backdrop heading into earnings on 10/14 with AI megadeals support. Bullish for litho capex cycle.\n- Micron (MU): Yahoo/blocksandfiles coverage highlights record revenue on AI DRAM/HBM demand; stock has surged but demand backdrop remains strong into HBM3E ramps.\n- Broadcom (AVGO): Reports of custom AI accelerator traction and large OpenAI custom silicon deal (Yahoo Finance). Supports AI infrastructure exposure beyond networking.\n- Nvidia (NVDA): Ongoing strong hyperscaler capex; street previews remain constructive around GB200/GB300 ramps (X post context). Near-term sentiment supportive despite supply cadence debates.\n\nNote: Reddit/X detailed threads were partially gated by login, but broad news flow across Reuters/Yahoo/industry sites remains constructive for AI/semis. No negative single-name catalysts detected for our holdings today.\n\nStep 3 — Valuation before any trades\n- NVDA: 13 x $183.235 = $2,382.06\n- AVGO: 3 x $349.42 = $1,048.26\n- MU: 8 x $202.41 = $1,619.28\n- MRVL: 1 x $87.96 = $87.96\n- Cash: $152.74\n- Total portfolio value (pre-trade): $5,290.30\n\nStep 4 — Allocation decision\n- Rationale:\n  - Maintain core exposure to leading AI GPU (NVDA) and custom silicon/networking leader (AVGO) given ongoing hyperscaler capex and reported custom chip tailwinds.\n  - Tilt a bit more toward MU (HBM3E/DRAM) on strong supply/demand dynamics supported by TSMC/ASML cycle strength and recent record revenue cadence.\n  - MRVL is a beneficiary of AI networking, but near-term specific catalysts are less visible versus MU’s HBM ramps; reallocate small MRVL position to MU.\n- Action taken:\n  - Sold MRVL 1 share at $87.23 (opening/executable price).\n  - Bought MU 1 share at $209.20 (opening/executable price).\n  - Note: This reallocation incurs small spread/slippage versus marks; accepted for longer-term positioning.\n\nStep 5 — Post-trade positions and current valuation\n- Updated positions: NVDA 13, AVGO 3, MU 9, Cash $30.77\n- Current valuation at today’s marks:\n  - NVDA: 13 x $183.235 = $2,382.06\n  - AVGO: 3 x $349.42 = $1,048.26\n  - MU: 9 x $202.41 = $1,821.69\n  - Cash: $30.77\n  - Total portfolio value (post-trade): $5,282.78\n- Notes:\n  - Net change from pre-trade: -$7.52 (-0.14%) due to execution spreads (sold MRVL ~0.8% below mark, bought MU ~3.3% above mark vs current value).\n- Updated weights (based on current marks):\n  - NVDA: ~45.1%\n  - MU: ~34.5%\n  - AVGO: ~19.8%\n  - Cash: ~0.6%\n\nStep 6 — Risk checks and next steps\n- Concentration: Portfolio remains concentrated in AI supply chain (NVDA/MU/AVGO). Macro (anticipated Fed easing) supportive for duration/growth.\n- Catalysts to watch:\n  - NVDA production/shipments for GB200/GB300 and any supply chain commentary.\n  - MU HBM3E capacity/additional pricing commentary; any hyperscaler purchasing signals.\n  - AVGO updates on custom AI silicon traction and VMware monetization cadence.\n  - ASML earnings and order intake; any comments on 2026 EUV/High-NA timing could influence sector multiples.\n- Plan: Hold current positioning; consider adding ASML/AMAT on pullbacks to diversify fab/packaging exposure if cash becomes available or via partial trim in an over-extended name. Reassess after next major earnings or if sentiment/ordering data shifts.\n\nExecuted transactions (today):\n- Sell: MRVL 1 @ $87.23 → Cash +$87.23\n- Buy: MU 1 @ $209.20 → Cash -$209.20\n- Ending cash: $30.77\n\nCurrent positions (non-zero):\n- NVDA: 13\n- AVGO: 3\n- MU: 9\n- CASH: $30.77\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

This trend was clearly demonstrated during the 2Q25 earnings season, where cloud/hyperscaler companies raised CAPEX guidance, and other AI beneficiaries (e.g., MTSI, ALAB, AMD) reported strong results and outlooks. In cyclical sectors such as telecom/service providers and enterprises, conditions are also showing gradual improvement. NVIDIA (NVDA) – Thanks to the ramp-up of GB200 production and the start of the GB300 program, July quarter results are expected to beat Wall Street expectations (revenue around $46–47bn), with October quarter guidance likely coming in at $53–54bn or higher, modestly above consensus.
