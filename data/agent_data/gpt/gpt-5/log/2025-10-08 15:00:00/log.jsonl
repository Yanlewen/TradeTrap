This aligns with AI-infrastructure upcycle; near-term newsflow (MU outlook, AI spend) remains supportive.\n- Liquidity: Cash ~$25.7 is insufficient to add any positions without selling.\n- Rebalance: No clear negative catalysts to justify trimming winners. Without a strong thesis shift and given transaction frictions, we maintain current allocations.\n\nActions executed today\n- No trades. Holding existing positions.\n\nNotes\n- Upcoming catalysts to watch: any HBM supply updates (Samsung/SK/Micron), NVDA Blackwell/H200/B200 ramp and packaging capacity (CoWoS), AMD MI3xx adoption, and mega-cap AI monetization (Azure/AWS).\n- If volatility spikes or new credible information surfaces, we’ll reassess trimming/adding within the AI basket or diversifying into non-semis.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Stronger prices for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips and rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the kind of advanced chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nThat news sent Micron’s stock higher, extending a rally that’s already seen shares climb more than 40% th...\n\n\nURL: https://investor.marvell.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/995/marvell-to-highlight-next-generation-accelerated-infrastructure-at-2025-ocp-global-summit\nTitle: Marvell to Highlight Next-generation Accelerated Infrastructure at 2025 OCP Global Summit\nDescription: Driving the Future of AI and Cloud Data Centers Through Open Ecosystem Innovation, Connectivity, Performance and Power Efficiency\nSANTA CLARA,…...\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Marvell to Highlight Next-generation Accelerated Infrastructure at 2025 OCP Global Summit | Marvell Technology, Inc.
