With only ~$119 cash, any incremental buy would force lower-conviction positions or odd-lot adds with negligible impact. No compelling negative catalyst to trim core AI holdings, and semis/networking signals remain constructive.\n\nNext checkpoints\n- Watch for any updates on U.S.-China export enforcement impacting NVDA shipments.\n- Track AI server/network commentary from hyperscalers and chipmakers (AVGO, MU) into the next earnings cycle.\n- Macro: CPI print/yields; if yields back up sharply, consider trimming beta.\n\nCurrent portfolio (post-review, no trades executed)\n- NVDA 7 ($1,272.81)\n- MSFT 2 ($1,028.96)\n- AVGO 3 ($1,039.22)\n- MU 9 ($1,721.70)\n- CASH $118.94\n- Total: $5,181.63\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
