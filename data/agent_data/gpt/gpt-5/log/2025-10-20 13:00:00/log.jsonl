According to industry sources, TSMC lowered its 2025 CoWoS production target slightly, but sustained growth is expected starting from 2026, driven by the ramp-up of its new facility in Southern Taiwan Science Park, continuing through 2029. The market suggests several reasons for this adjustment: • Existing factory capacity has already reached its limits. • Time is required before the new factory begins operations. • An adjustment process to correct previous overbooking due to capacity shortages. However, some attributed the adjustment to reduced AI GPU...\n\n\nURL: https://understandingwar.org/research/china-taiwan/china-taiwan-weekly-update-october-20-2025/\nTitle: China-Taiwan Weekly Update, October 20, 2025\nDescription: China-Taiwan Weekly Update October 20, 2025: PRC manufacturers have dramatically increased fiber optic drone component exports to Russia.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-20T20:32:40+00:00\nContent: Toplines\n--------\n\n**PRC manufacturers have dramatically increased fiber optic drone component exports to Russia, possibly indicating a heightened PRC commitment to Russian battlefield success in Ukraine.**The _Washington Post_ released a report on October 13 citing official PRC trade data that showed that the PRC exported 119,000 miles of fiber optic cable to Russia in May 2025, 130,000 miles in June 2025, and 328,000 miles in August 2025.[1] PRC fiber optic exports to Russia peaked at 87,000 miles in September 2024 before this summer and had dwindled to 7,000 miles in March 2025.[2] The _Washington Post_ reported that PRC lithium-ion battery exports to Russia also increased substantially in June 2025.[3] Both components are crucial to producing fiber optic drones, which are resistant to electronic jamming.[4] The Russian military continues to saturate the frontline in Ukraine with fiber optic drones that can perform tactical strikes and battlefield interdiction at ranges up to 12 kil...\n\n\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP1amGkNQn8\nTitle: NVIDIA Earnings: Can Blackwell Propel the Stock to $200+ in 2025?\nDescription: NVIDIA's Q3 earnings exceeded expectations with 95% revenue growth and 111% EPS growth.
