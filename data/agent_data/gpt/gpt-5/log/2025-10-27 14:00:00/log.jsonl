Ongoing AI capex cycle remains robust.\n  - Policy backdrop: Reports in mid-2025 indicated partial export rule reversals allowing certain China-bound parts (e.g., H20), though China countermeasures add uncertainty. Net effect: global ex-China demand remains the key driver.\n  - Social chatter: Some posts highlight the “GPU vs custom ASIC” debate (with AVGO/MRVL strength), but consensus among analysts is they will coexist given software flexibility advantages of GPUs near-term.\n\n- Micron (MU)\n  - Earnings: Recent Q4 FY2025 ahead of expectations; HBM and server DRAM driving upside; positive guide.\n  - Supply/demand: TrendForce notes DRAM capacity growth constrained through 2026 due to HBM focus—supportive for pricing across the cycle.\n  - Macro tailwind: Continued AI server buildouts suggest sustained HBM visibility.\n\n- Broadcom (AVGO)\n  - Earnings: Strong Q3 2025; AI semis up sharply; VMware integration driving software growth; record backlog (~$110B reported by third-party summary).\n  - Strategic: Custom AI silicon/accelerator momentum complements GPU ecosystem versus replacing it.\n\n- Macro IT capex\n  - Gartner: 2026 IT spend forecast +9.8% y/y to >$6T—supportive of enterprise infrastructure, AI hardware, and software spending trajectories.\n\n- Reddit/X sentiment\n  - Some WSB-style bearish option yolo posts surface (limited access due to network restrictions), but not a reliable signal. Overall, no broad negative wave detected; AI-related tickers remain central in discussions.\n\nStep 5 — Assessment and action\n- Thesis check:\n  - NVDA: Leadership in AI accelerators, Blackwell ramp forthcoming, software stack advantages. Risks: custom ASIC encroachment, geopolitics; but near-to-medium term demand remains robust.\n  - MU: Positioned to benefit from HBM scarcity/pricing and server DRAM cycle. Near-term fundamentals continue to improve; structural tailwinds persist into 2026.\n  - AVGO: Dual engine (AI semis + VMware) with strong backlog; benefits from custom silicon demand, networking (Tomahawk/Jericho), and software cash flows.\n\n- Portfolio construction:\n  - Currently 3-name AI/semis-concentrated basket with minimal cash.\n  - With only ~$24 cash, no incremental buys are possible.\n  - Any redeployment would require selling a position first.\n\nDecision today\n- No change. Maintain positions.\n  - Rationale: Fundamental momentum remains favorable across all three holdings; there is no compelling deterioration warranting trims. With limited cash, forced rebalancing would increase trading risk and potential opportunity cost heading into ongoing AI capex strength. We will keep dry powder as is and monitor catalysts (Blackwell production/ramp updates, MU supply/pricing commentary, AVGO next print and VMware synergies) for opportunistic adjustments.\n\nMonitoring plan (near-term)\n- NVDA: Watch for Blackwell production/ramp timelines, CoWoS capacity updates, and any incremental guidance on supply/demand mix.\n- MU: Track HBM3E/HBM4 transitions, pricing commentary, and capacity expansion cadence.\n- AVGO: Monitor AI custom silicon pipeline updates, VMware cross-sell/renewal metrics, and networking product cycles.\n\nNo trades executed today.\n\nSummary of current portfolio after update\n- NVDA: 8 shares (27.61%)\n- AVGO: 5 shares (32.58%)\n- MU: 10 shares (39.35%)\n- Cash: $23.98 (0.43%)\n- Total value: ~$5,537.93\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Amid this trend, the company has raised its guidance for the coming quarter.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) published its Q4 FY2025 results, which came in ahead of analyst expectations. Revenue totalled 11.32 billion USD, while adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share reached 3.03 USD – both above market forecasts. The primary driver of growth was strong demand from data centres, particularly in AI-related solutions, including HBM memory and server DRAM.\n\nThe company also strengthened its cash flow position. Free cash flow after capital expenditure amounted to +803 million USD, with 4.93 billion USD invested in equipment and capacity expansion (CapEx). At quarter-end, Micron held 11.94 billion USD in cash and short-term investments – a solid liquidity buffer, especially given its extensive production expansion plans.\n\nThe key revenue growth driver in the quarter was the cloud segment.
