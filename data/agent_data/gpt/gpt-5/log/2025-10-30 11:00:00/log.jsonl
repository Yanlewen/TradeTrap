Swapping 1 NVDA for 1 MU would tilt further toward memory at the expense of the leading platform provider just ahead of NVDA’s upcoming Blackwell ramp and guidance. Swapping AVGO to MU would reduce diversification into software/network/custom silicon.\n- Decision: Hold positions unchanged today.\n  - Rationale: The basket is balanced across the AI compute stack. Near-term catalysts (NVDA guidance; MU HBM visibility; AVGO VMware execution) look constructive across all three. With minimal cash, forced rotation doesn’t offer a superior risk-reward right now.\n  - Next checks: Reassess after any material US–China export headlines, and around NVDA’s next earnings/guidance window; consider adding to MU on any pullback if cash becomes available, or trimming into strength to rebalance if any one name exceeds ~40% of portfolio.\n\nNo trades executed today. Portfolio stays:\n- NVDA: 10\n- AVGO: 5\n- MU: 8\n- CASH: 56.1406\n\nWatchlist and triggers\n- NVDA: Blackwell shipment commentary, China B30A export decision, next earnings date and DC segment growth cadence.\n- MU: HBM capacity additions, pricing, customer mix tied to Blackwell/Hopper demand.\n- AVGO: VMware renewal/expansion metrics, AI custom silicon pipeline, networking demand signals.\n\nI will continue monitoring X/Reddit/news for any sudden policy or demand updates that warrant reallocations intraday.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The power supply chain will remain a bottleneck through 2030, and data centers will be have to be located closer to liquid power hubs.\n*   AI is credit-positive for many tech companies, data center operators, and power providers in the current early stage of development. Key risks will likely come from competitive disruption and pricing-model changes in software, lease renewal uncertainty in data centers, and the availability of power.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a transformative force in the global tech industry in the fall of 2022.

Understanding why Nvidia is winning requires a more complete understanding of the semiconductor industry. The industry is shaped by industry standards, rapid innovation, supply-demand dynamics, fierce competition, and the business cycle.\n\nWhat drives these dynamics, and where is the industry headed next?\n\nThe Basics\n\nSemiconductors are materials that can either conduct or insulate electrical current under certain conditions. This is a unique property; many other natural materials are either conductors or insulators. Silicon quickly became the leading material for use in semiconductors due to its abundance and cost efficiency.\n\nThe discovery of a semiconducting material eventually led to the invention of the transistor. A transistor is essentially a switch for electrical current; it can be 'on' or 'off' which is represented by a '1' or a '0'. These are known as 'bits' or binary digits. A string of 8 bits is know...\n\n\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfpel0/avgo_analysis_dd/\nTitle: \nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: You've been blocked by network security.\n\nTo continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer token\n\nIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.\n\n[Log in](https://www.reddit.com/login/)[File a ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=21879292693140)...\n\n\nURL: https://www.sdxcentral.com/analysis/broadcom-bounces-vmware-operating-concerns/\nTitle: Broadcom bounces VMware operating concerns\nDescription: Broadcom posted robust VMware-led earnings for its most recent quarter and expects even more from that deal going forward.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Broadcom shrugged off the ability to grow the VMware business despite ongoing customer unrest.\n\nBroadcom posted robust VMware-led earnings for its most recent quarter and expects even more from that deal going forward, shrugging off concerns over Broadcom’s ability to grow that business despite ongoing customer unrest.\n\nBroadcom’s software infrastructure business, which is where VMware now lives, scored $5.8 billion in revenues during the fourth quarter of Broadcom’s fiscal 2024.
