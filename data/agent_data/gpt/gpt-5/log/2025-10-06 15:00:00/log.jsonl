Although it did not achieve notable success with the previous-generation HBM3E, industry observers say the atmosphere is shifting with the next-generation HBM4. In particular, visible collaboration with NVIDIA — the largest HBM customer — is positioning Samsung as a potential “game changer” capable of reshaping the market landscape. According to industry sources, Samsung is expected to secure the No. 2 position in NVIDIA’s HBM4 supply chain next year. While SK hynix is likely to maintain exclusivity in the first half, the competitive landscape is projected to be reorganized in the second half.

The growth outlook is driven by accelerating demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a key component in powering advanced AI models and data centers.\n\nIn Q4, Micron’s HBM revenue reached nearly $2B, implying an $8B annualized run rate. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted that HBM3E supply for 2026 is largely sold out, while pricing discussions for HBM4 remain ongoing. Micron highlighted that HBM4 pricing will be “significantly higher” than HBM3E, reflecting a tight supply environment.\n\nMicron also reported an adjusted gross margin of 51.5%, beating consensus of 45.9%, and earnings of $3.03 per share. Analysts cited stronger-than-expected pricing as a key driver.\n\nOn the U.S. policy front, Micron has received $6.2B in CHIPS Act subsidies, with a disbursement tied to its Idaho fab construction milestone. Executives emphasized they do not anticipate changes to their agreement despite potential revisions to grant structures under review.\n\nWith NVIDIA among its HBM customers and TSMC set to manufacture logic dies for upcoming HBM4E, Micron Technology is positioning itself as a critical player in the AI memory supply chain.\n\n👉 How will Micron’s HBM momentum reshape competition with SK hynix and Samsung Electronics?\n\nThanks to Reuters for providing the full article with additional background, charts, and insights at the link below. 👇\nhttps://lnkd.in/gnWQf4_s\n\n#ChipDesign,#SemiconductorManufacturing,#VLSI,#Lithography,#ICPackaging\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Micron Technology beats Q1 revenue, HBM demand drives growth | Robert Quinn posted on the topic | LinkedIn\n\n===============\n\nAgree & Join LinkedIn\n\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_user-agreement), [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_privacy-policy), and [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_cookie-policy).\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertquinn2020_chipdesign-semiconductormanufacturing-activity-7376601343202947072-4MCI#main-content)[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/?trk=public_post_nav-header-logo)\n*   [Top Content](https://www.linkedin.com/top-content?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_topContent)\n*   [People](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/+/+?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_people)\n*   [Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/...\n\n\nURL: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806275-amd-flipped-script-ai-70-percent-price-hike-could-change-everything\nTitle: AMD Just Flipped The Script On AI: A 70% Price Hike That Could Change Everything\nDescription: Advanced Micro Devices' rumored 70% price jump for its Instinct MI350 AI chips is a real-time signal that it is evolving.
