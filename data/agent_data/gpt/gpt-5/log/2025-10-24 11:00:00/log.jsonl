Day-to-day: mild pressure noted on some sources, but no fresh negative catalysts today.\n- Sector backdrop\n  - TSMC Q3 revenue beat (Reuters 2025-10-09) underscores continued AI demand strength through the value chain.\n  - Macro: Reuters (2025-10-24) shows US business activity picked up but sentiment weaker amid protectionist trade concerns—could add volatility to cyclical tech.\n\nStep 4 — Assessment versus strategy and constraints\n- Cash is only ~$30.77—insufficient to add shares.\n- Concentration is acceptable for an AI/semis tilt, but NVDA is the largest weight (≈44%).\n- Near-term catalysts:\n  - NVDA earnings in less than a month—potentially material.\n  - MU continues to benefit from HBM/AI memory tailwinds.\n  - AVGO steady; no pressing catalyst but quality compounder profile.\n\nDecision and actions\n- No trades executed today:\n  - Rationale: Insufficient cash to deploy; no strong negative catalyst to reduce core positions; positive AI/semis demand trends balanced against China/trade risk. Prefer to keep exposure into NVDA earnings and sustained MU momentum.\n- Risk notes:\n  - NVDA China export/inspection risk could pressure shares short-term. If unexpected deterioration in China headlines or a technical break triggers risk controls, consider trimming 1–2 NVDA shares to rebalance and rebuild cash.\n- Monitoring/next steps:\n  - NVDA: Track pre-earnings revisions and datapoints around H200/B100 momentum and any China shipment commentary.\n  - MU: Watch HBM supply expansions (CoWoS capacity) and pricing updates; any guidance pre-announcements.\n  - AVGO: Watch software growth commentary and semi demand comments; valuation remains elevated but justified by cash flows.\n\nCurrent portfolio after review (no change)\n- NVDA: 13\n- AVGO: 3\n- MU: 9\n- CASH: $30.77\n- Total market value (today): ≈ $5,434.86\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
