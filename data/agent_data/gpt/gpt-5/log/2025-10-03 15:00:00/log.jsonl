Nasdaq wobbly.\n  - Recent jobs data context (CNBC Sep): Earlier large downward revisions to payrolls highlight slowing momentum; markets sensitive to macro prints.\n- Semis/AI\n  - NVDA: Ongoing enterprise/partner momentum (e.g., Fujitsu collaboration on full-stack AI). Prior reports denying H100/H200/Blackwell supply-constraint rumors (Sep 2). Sentiment still constructive for AI infra.\n  - MU: Recent Q4 FY2025 beat on DRAM/HBM with stronger guidance and margin expansion; data center AI demand strong.\n- Mega-cap tech\n  - AMZN: Prime Big Deal Days set for Oct 7–8; historically a Q4 demand tailwind.\n  - AAPL: Mixed narrative on China demand/AI roadmap in prior months; no fresh 10/03-specific catalyst surfaced in our scan today.\n  - MSFT: Heavy AI capex continues alongside strong cloud; recent reports (late Oct) flagged investor debate on spend vs growth.\n\nStep 5 — Decision and actions\n- Constraints: Available cash (~$83.76) is insufficient for incremental MU/NVDA/AMZN/MSFT/AAPL share purchases at current prices.\n- Rebalance consideration: AAPL could be trimmed to fund favored names (MU/NVDA/AMZN), but near-term catalysts favor holding:\n  - MU: Positive momentum from HBM/DRAM strength.\n  - AMZN: Immediate catalyst (Prime Big Deal Days next week).\n  - NVDA: Ongoing AI infra demand/partnerships; macro volatility but constructive trend.\n  - MSFT: Balanced by Azure growth despite capex debate.\n  - AAPL: No new negative catalyst today; maintain for diversification.\n- Action today: No trades executed. Hold positions and preserve small cash buffer.\n\nWhat I’ll watch into next sessions\n- AMZN: Price action into and through Oct 7–8 (Prime Big Deal Days). Potential add on any pullback with strong volume.\n- MU/NVDA: Follow-through on HBM/Blackwell headlines; watch semis’ reaction to yields/macro. Add on weakness if thesis intact.\n- AAPL: Any China demand or AI roadmap updates; consider rotation if AAPL underperforms into earnings vs semis/AMZN strength.\n- Macro: Rates and any labor/inflation prints that could sway tech multiples.\n\nSummary\n- Total portfolio value: 5,095.93\n- No trades today; positioning remains overweight semis (MU, NVDA) and AMZN, balanced with MSFT/AAPL.\n- Cash: 1.6% for flexibility; will redeploy on tactical pullbacks or post-catalyst confirmation early next week.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Initial estimates indicate that Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annualized rate of less than 1.0% during the first quarter. This marks a slowdown from the robust growth rate observed in 2024 (2.8%), reflecting a more cautious economic environment. The economy's ability to sustain growth amidst these challenges has been noteworthy, but unfortunately, its luck may be running out.\n\nConsumer conditions remained relatively stable, contributing to the economic momentum. Nonfarm payrolls added another 228,000 jobs in March, better than expectations. Along with that, the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, but there are signs of potential future job market weak...\n\n\nURL: https://seekingalpha.com/news/4491308-nvidia-says-supply-constraint-claims-are-categorically-false\nTitle: Nvidia says supply constraint claims are 'categorically false'\nDescription: In a reaction to media reports, Nvidia (NVDA) attempted to set the record straight and declared there are no supply constraints for cloud access to its H100, H200 or Blackwell GPUs.\nPublish Time: 2025-09-02T16:38:16.000Z\nContent: Nvidia says supply constraint claims are 'categorically false' (NVDA:NASDAQ) | Seeking Alpha\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to content](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4491308-nvidia-says-supply-constraint-claims-are-categorically-false#content)\n\n[Home page Seeking Alpha - Power to Investors](https://seekingalpha.com/#source=source%3Asite_navigation)\n\n*   Create Free Account\n*   [About Premium](https://seekingalpha.com/subscriptions/premium#source=why_premium%3Aexpanded%3Anavbar_left)\n*   [Explore Alpha Picks](https://subscriptions.seekingalpha.com/lp_alpha-picks_sub/#source=explore_alpha_picks%3Aexpanded%3Anavbar_left)\n*   [NEW Virtual Analyst Report](https://seekingalpha.com/subscriptions/premium-virtual-analyst-report#source=virtual_analyst_report%3Aexpanded%3Anavbar_left)\n*   [FREE Newsletters](https://seekingalpha.com/free-investing-newsletters#source=free_newsletters%3Aexpanded%3Anavbar_left)\n\n[Home](https://seekingalpha.com/#source=home%3Aexpanded%3Anavbar_left)\n\n*   \n[Stock Analysis](ht...\n\n\nURL: https://x.com/fujitsulabs/status/1977902176430100562\nTitle: Fujitsu Research on X: \"Fujitsu expands strategic collaboration with NVIDIA (@nvidia ) to deliver full-stack AI infrastructure!\n\nThe initiative aims to bolster enterprises' competitive edge through AI, while preserving their autonomy in AI utilization.
