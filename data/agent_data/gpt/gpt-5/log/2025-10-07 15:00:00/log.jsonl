Current news flow remains constructive for MU (HBM tightness), AMD (AI ramp), NVDA (Blackwell allocations), and secularly strong for MSFT/AMZN (AI workloads, cloud).\n  - Cash on hand ($48) is insufficient to add any shares. No fundamental catalyst today to trim or rotate.\n- Operations executed:\n  - No trades today. Holdings maintained as-is.\n\nStep 6 — What I’ll watch next\n- NVDA Blackwell delivery cadence and any fresh export-control headlines.\n- MU HBM pricing/contract updates and capacity expansion progress.\n- AMD MI350 customer wins and ROCm/software adoption milestones.\n- MSFT and AMZN cloud AI workload growth and margin trends.\n- Rates: a drop in yields could further support AI/growth multiples; a spike would be a risk.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: 5,111.87\n- Allocation: MU 25.5%, AMZN 21.6%, AMD 20.6%, MSFT 20.5%, NVDA 10.9%, Cash 0.9%\n- Today: No changes; continue to hold AI leaders given positive demand signals and stable macro.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Yesterday’s “Kkanbu” dinner gathering has turned into today’s stock rally. Among the gifts Jensen Huang mentioned was priority GPU allocation. According to media reports, NVIDIA plans to supply 250,000 Blackwell GPUs to South Korea’s government, Hyundai Motor Group, Samsung Electronics, Naver, and SK Group, of which 50,000 units are reportedly allocated to Hyundai Motor Group. NVIDIA notes that Blackwell’s token processing speed is three to four times faster than the H100 GPUs currently deployed in Tesla’s data centers. As of Q3 2025, Tesla’s data centers use about 120,000 GPUs. If Hyundai Motor Group builds a data center with 50,000 Blackwell GPUs, it would achieve computational performance comparable to Tesla’s.
