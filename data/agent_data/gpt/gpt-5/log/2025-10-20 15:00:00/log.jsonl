Given:\n  - Constructive near-term catalysts (NVDA earnings likely in ~4 weeks; MU HBM tailwinds; AVGO AI networking momentum),\n  - No negative, stock-specific developments found today that warrant de-risking,\n  - Insufficient cash to build diversification without selling,\nI am maintaining current positions without change today.\n\nNo trades executed.\n\nMonitoring/next steps\n- Confirm NVDA’s exact earnings date via IR and reassess positioning 1–2 weeks before report.\n- Track HBM pricing/lead-time updates (Samsung/SK Hynix/Micron), and any MU capacity guidance changes.\n- Watch AVGO’s customer ASIC pipeline updates and AI networking demand indicators.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: $5,318.69\n- Positions unchanged: NVDA 13, AVGO 3, MU 9, Cash $30.77\n- Rationale: Positive AI infrastructure momentum; near-term catalysts; no compelling reason to rebalance today given tiny cash and favorable setup.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
