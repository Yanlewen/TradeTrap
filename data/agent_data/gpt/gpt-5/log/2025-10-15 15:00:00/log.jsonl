Industry chatter on X suggests SK Hynix increasingly focused on competing with Micron’s HBM momentum.\n- Nvidia China exposure: X commentary notes export control pressures on Nvidia’s China sales, which could cap some regional revenue but doesn’t change global AI demand trajectory.\n- Broadcom (AVGO): Public sentiment on Reddit regarding VMware integration has mixed tones (access limited by network blocks), with some posts hinting at customer friction. No concrete new catalysts today; AVGO’s valuation remains elevated after its run.\n- Microsoft (MSFT): Ongoing strong Azure/AI capex themes from prior Reuters coverage; no specific new headline today, but MSFT remains a key AI infrastructure beneficiary.\n\n4) Trade decision and execution\nRationale:\n- The portfolio was heavily concentrated in semis, with AVGO at ~34% weight. Given mixed sentiment around VMware integration and to improve liquidity into earnings season, I trimmed AVGO modestly to reduce concentration risk and raise cash, while maintaining core exposure to semis and AI.\nAction taken:\n- Sold 1 share of AVGO at today’s opening price 353.67 via tool.\n\n5) Post-trade positions and valuation\n- Updated positions after sale: NVDA 7, MSFT 1, AVGO 4, MU 8, CASH 472.4436\n- Updated equities valuation using marking prices:\n  - NVDA: 1263.885\n  - MSFT: 513.97\n  - AVGO: 4 x 353.69 = 1414.76\n  - MU: 1531.9504\n- Total equities: 1263.885 + 513.97 + 1414.76 + 1531.9504 = 4724.5654\n- Total portfolio: 4724.5654 + 472.4436 = 5197.009\n- New weights:\n  - NVDA ~ 24.3%\n  - MSFT ~ 9.9%\n  - AVGO ~ 27.2%\n  - MU ~ 29.5%\n  - Cash ~ 9.1%\n\n6) Plan and risk management\n- Maintain core AI/semis exposure (NVDA, MU) grounded by strong HBM and AI infrastructure trends.\n- Hold higher cash to deploy on pullbacks or on clear catalysts:\n  - NVDA: Watch export control developments and Blackwell ramp; consider adding on weakness if global demand signals remain strong.\n  - MU: Monitor HBM supply/pricing updates and upcoming earnings; positive margin trajectory could justify increasing the position.\n  - MSFT: If cash builds sufficiently, adding MSFT on dips aligns with durable AI-enabled Azure growth.\n  - AVGO: Reassess after further clarity on VMware customer retention, pricing changes, and networking/AI accelerator momentum.\n\nNo further trades executed pending clearer near-term catalysts and to preserve optionality with higher cash.\n\nFinal positions\n- NVDA: 7\n- MSFT: 1\n- AVGO: 4\n- MU: 8\n- CASH: 472.4436\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Background: On April 15, Nvidia was reportedly restricted from selling its less advanced Hopper GPU, the H20, to China. The U.S. government has informed the company that future sales of the H20 to China will require a license—effectively amounting to a ban, as such licenses for a China sales are unlikely to be granted. 2. Estimated Loss in CY 2026: In its 8-K filing to the SEC, Nvidia disclosed a $5.5 billion charge in Q1 FY2026 related to H20 product inventory, purchase commitments, and associated reserves. However, the immediate financial hit may only scratch the surface. If the current restrictions persist, Nvidia will in fact lose up to $22 billion in annual revenue for all of FY2026 tied to H20 sales to China. The implications extend far beyond the H20 or the loss this year.

I came into the year very negative which is why cash invested in money market funds yielding over 4% was my top pick. I became bullish in early April on oversold technical conditions for stocks. And now with the S&P up year-to-date on good Q1 earnings with demand being pulled forward as I suspected, I see more choppy trading but with the possibility of new record highs. The risk versus reward seems to be roughly balanced in the near-term. The slightly positive tilt is from the market seemingly adjusting to 10/30 year yields increasing to around 4.5%/5.0% respectively and the US dollar dropping below $100 which were problems earlier in the year. But as Thanksgiving approaches, I continue to think holiday demand and stocks will suffer because of the demand pull-in. But this is a worry for another day.

Lately, there’s been talk among engineers that Micron is said to be ‘in top form’ and is pursuing them with alarming intensity.”(Semiconductor industry insider) Since the end of last year, there have been many reports suggesting that Micron’s chase—often referred to as the rebellion of the perennial third-ranked memory company—is no trivial matter. At the time, it wasn’t clear what to make of it, but recent trends in the memory market largely justify those concerns. Micron has achieved significant sales with HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) in Q1 this year and is expecting its best annual performance yet. Notably, Micron has quietly set its sights on the AI memory market—often dubbed the “second HBM.” By announcing that it started mass production ahead of SK Hynix, Micron delivered a clear counterpunch.
