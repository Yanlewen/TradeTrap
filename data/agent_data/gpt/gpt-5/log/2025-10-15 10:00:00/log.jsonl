Market reaction reportedly strong (AVGO up double digits on headlines).\n- NVDA:\n  - Blackwell expected to dominate high-end GPU shipments in 2025 (TrendForce via EE Times Asia, Aug). No fresh negative today; sentiment noisy on X but nothing thesis-breaking today.\n- MU (Micron):\n  - Recent guidance raise (late Sept articles) tied to DRAM/HBM pricing/demand; HBM share estimates show SK Hynix leading, Micron improving but still No.2. Positive mid-term, but near-term upside today less catalyst-heavy than AVGO’s news.\n- Macro:\n  - CPI nowcasts available from Cleveland Fed; no disruptive macro headline found in our scrape impacting today’s decision.\n\nStep 4 — Portfolio decision rationale\n- Objective: Maximize long-term returns with prudent rebalancing in AI infrastructure leaders.\n- Rationale to adjust:\n  - MU weight was high (~33%). While MU fundamentals are improving with AI/HBM, AVGO just received a distinct incremental catalyst (OpenAI partnership) that can drive backlog, custom silicon visibility, and potentially multiple expansion.\n  - Shift a slice from MU into AVGO to better align with current catalysts while keeping core AI exposure via NVDA and MSFT intact.\n\nStep 5 — Executed trades (at today’s open prices)\n- Sold MU 1 share at 189.08\n- Sold MU 1 share at 189.08\n- Bought AVGO 1 share at 354.22\n\nNew positions after trades\n- NVDA: 7\n- MSFT: 2\n- AVGO: 4\n- MU: 7\n- Cash: 142.8836\n\nStep 6 — Post-trade valuation and weights (using current value prices)\n- Equity valuation:\n  - NVDA = 7 × 180.07 = 1,260.49\n  - MSFT = 2 × 513.71 = 1,027.42\n  - AVGO = 4 × 344.13 = 1,376.52\n  - MU = 7 × 187.04 = 1,309.28\n  - Total equities = 4,973.71\n- Total portfolio (post-trade) = 4,973.71 + 142.88 = 5,116.59\n- Post-trade weights:\n  - NVDA ~ 24.6%\n  - MSFT ~ 20.1%\n  - AVGO ~ 26.9%\n  - MU ~ 25.6%\n  - Cash ~ 2.8%\n\nNotes and next steps\n- The reallocation slightly reduced total value intraday due to mark-to-market differentials, but it improves alignment with today’s incremental catalyst (AVGO/OpenAI) while maintaining diversified AI exposure (NVDA/MSFT/MU).\n- With cash at ~2.8% and limited ability to add to NVDA/MSFT/AVGO at current asks, we’ll hold cash for flexibility. Candidates to monitor if prices pull back: NVDA, AVGO, and selectively MRVL/QCOM on any weakness, subject to fresh news checks on X/Reddit.\n- Upcoming catalysts to watch:\n  - AVGO: Any formal details/updates from OpenAI partnership, custom silicon pipeline signals.\n  - NVDA: Blackwell ramp updates and next event commentary.\n  - MU: HBM capacity/qualification updates versus Hynix/Samsung, pricing strength.\n  - MSFT: Azure AI demand and Copilot monetization trajectory in the next earnings update.\n\nFinal updated positions\n- NVDA: 7\n- MSFT: 2\n- AVGO: 4\n- MU: 7\n- Cash: 142.8836\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Investors and traders engaged in discussions focusing on bearish technical indicators like volume profiles and gaps, suggesting further declines. Some traders capitalized on this by selling put options, while others saw it as a buying opportunity for long-term investment. There was a notable sentiment of frustration among some traders regarding perceived market manipulation aimed at lowering the stock price. The trading community was actively sharing updates and strategies, with many anticipating specific price levels for potential rebounds or further drops.\n\nThis story is a summary of posts on X and may evolve over time.

(Ticker: MU) recently gave investors a surprise. The company lifted its fiscal Q4 2025 outlook, calling for $11.2 billion in sales—about half a billion more than it had expected just weeks earlier. Gross margins are also moving higher, now projected at 44.5%. The reason?
