Core AI/custom silicon momentum intact but headline/regulatory risk persists.\n- Micron (MU)\n  - Reuters (2025-10-28) cites SK Hynix sold out for 2026 and a chip “super cycle” view, supporting AI memory demand; this is constructive read-through for MU’s HBM3E and DRAM pricing trajectory.\n- Sector\n  - AI semis remain supported by strong accelerator and HBM demand; sentiment constructive, with periodic headline risk (regulatory for AVGO, product transition for NVDA).\n\nStep 5 — Decision and rationale\n- No trade today.\n  - Cash is only ~$18.50, insufficient to add any positions.\n  - MU has strong tailwinds from the AI memory cycle; AVGO continues to benefit from AI/custom silicon and networking; NVDA remains a core AI exposure with near-term narrative noise but strong secular demand.\n  - With limited cash and no need to reduce risk right now, we keep the current allocation.\n\nStep 6 — What we’re watching next\n- NVDA’s next earnings/call in November: updates on Blackwell timing, H200/H100 supply, and data center demand cadence.\n- MU’s HBM3E capacity updates and pricing commentary into FQ1 FY2026 (expected in December).\n- AVGO regulatory headlines around VMware pricing and integration, plus AI accelerator/custom chip commentary on the next earnings.\n- Sector-wide data center capex commentary from hyperscalers during their earnings windows.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: $5,909.65\n- Allocation: MU ~39.2%, AVGO ~32.3%, NVDA ~28.3%, Cash ~0.3%\n- No changes to positions today; we remain positioned in AI compute (NVDA), AI infrastructure/networking (AVGO), and AI memory (MU), with minimal cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Design Flaws: There were reports in August 2024 about design flaws which led to delays in mass production. This issue was related to the processor die that connects two Blackwell GPUs on a single Nvidia GB200 Superchip. The design flaw necessitated a redesign, which was expected to push back the delivery schedule by at least three months or more.\n2.   Yield Issues: Nvidia later admitted in August 2024 that its Blackwell-based products were experiencing low production yields. This required a re-spin of some layers of the B200 processor to improve yields, with production ramp-up scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n3.   Overheating Problems: Reports in November 2024 highlighted concerns over overheating when Blackwell GPUs were deployed in server racks, raising issues about their deployment in data centers.\n\nOriginal Release Date:\n\n*   The Blackwell...\n\n\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1odld9a/motley_fool_prediction_nvidias_stock_price_in_5/\nTitle: \nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: You've been blocked by network security.\n\nTo continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer token\n\nIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.\n\n[Log in](https://www.reddit.com/login/)[File a ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=21879292693140)...\n\n\nURL: https://x.com/JacksonHPC\nTitle: Profile / X\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Profile / X\n\n===============\n\nDon’t miss what’s happening\n\nPeople on X are the first to know.\n\n[Log in](https://x.com/login)\n\n[Sign up](https://x.com/i/flow/signup)\n\n[](https://x.com/)\n==================\n\nProfile\n-------...\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/04/broadcom-avgo-q3-2025-earnings-report.html\nTitle: Broadcom’s stock pops on mystery $10 billion AI customer\nDescription: Broadcom has been one of the biggest winners in the artificial intelligence boom and investor expectations are growing.\nPublish Time: 2025-09-04T16:00:01+0000\nContent: Broadcom (AVGO) Q3 2025 earnings report\n\n===============\n\n[Skip Navigation](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/04/broadcom-avgo-q3-2025-earnings-report.html#MainContent)\n\n[![Image 2: CNBC](https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/7821ea3cb72f88388591.svg)](https://www.cnbc.com/world/)\n\n[Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets/)\n\n*   [Pre-Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/pre-markets/)\n*   [U.S. Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/us-markets/)\n*   [Europe Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-europe/)\n*   [China Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/china-markets/)\n*   [Asia Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-asia-pacific/)\n*   [World Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/world-markets/)\n*   [Currencies](https://www.cnbc.com/currencies/)\n*   [Cryptocurrency](https://www.cnbc.com/cryptocurrency/)\n*   [Futures & Commodities](https://www.cnbc.com/futures-and-commodities/)\n*   [Bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/bonds/)\n*   [Funds & ETFs](https://www.cnbc.com/funds-and-etfs/)\n\n[Business](https://www.cnbc.com/business/)\n\n*   [Eco...\n\n\nURL: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832790-micron-the-most-attractive-artificial-intelligence-play\nTitle: Micron: The Most Attractive Artificial Intelligence Play\nDescription: Micron Technology stands out as the most attractive AI play, trading at a forward P/E of 11 with robust AI-driven growth.

According to The Information:\n\n> “The first shipments of racks equipped with Nvidia’s newest chips, Blackwell, have been plagued by overheating as well as glitches involving the way the chips connect to one another, according to three people working at suppliers and two customers that have dealt with the issues. These kinds of defects aren’t unusual for a new type of chip, but they’re delaying the data center plans of customers such as Microsoft. In response, Microsoft and three other major customers—Amazon Web Services, Google and Meta Platforms—recently cut some orders of Nvidia’s Blackwell GB200 racks, according to two people who work at suppliers of the customers.
