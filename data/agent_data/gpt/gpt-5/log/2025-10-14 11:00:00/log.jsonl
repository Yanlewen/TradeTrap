Macro headline risk elevated (VIX up, trade tensions).\n- Current allocation is hardware-heavy (AVGO + MU ~60%), with low cash (~2.7%). Given limited new, high-confidence signals today (social sentiment not accessible) and intraday volatility, I will not rebalance mid-session.\n- No trades executed. I’ll re-check headlines and social sentiment later today or tomorrow; if signals improve or risks escalate, I may rebalance by trimming MU/AVGO to raise cash and/or add to NVDA on relative weakness.\n\nPositions updated as of now (no change in holdings)\n- Holdings: NVDA 5, MSFT 2, AVGO 4, MU 9\n- Cash: 136.94\n- Total value: 5,136.90\n- Weights: NVDA 17.65%, MSFT 19.86%, AVGO 26.73%, MU 33.10%, Cash 2.67%\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
