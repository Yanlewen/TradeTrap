Sentiment on X points to continued robust Blackwell/GB200 pipeline, though details today are limited from our scrape attempts.\n  - MU (Micron): Ongoing bullish narrative around HBM3E/AI memory demand and pricing; third-party writeups suggest upside ahead on AI server builds (Globe and Mail syndication of MarketBeat).\n  - AVGO (Broadcom): Showcased end-to-end AI networking (Tomahawk 6/Ultra, Jericho4) at OCP 2025 in October, reinforcing AI networking leadership and VMware integration tailwinds (Broadcom IR news).\n- Handsets:\n  - Apple reported record iPhone sales and guided double-digit revenue growth into holiday quarter (The Guardian, Oct 30, 2025). Positive second-order read-through for AVGO’s handset content, though our exposure is primarily AI networking, which is the larger structural growth driver.\n- Note: Direct Reddit/X thread content access was limited by network restrictions, but multiple sources corroborate strong AI infra demand and a mixed-to-risk-off tape today for large-cap tech.\n\nStep 3 — Valuation update pre-trade (based on today’s prices)\n- NVDA: 10 × 206.4751 = $2,064.75\n- AVGO: 5 × 374.1377 = $1,870.69\n- MU: 7 × 229.24 = $1,604.68\n- Cash: $375.84\n- Total portfolio (pre-trade): approximately $5,916.0\n\nStep 4 — Portfolio action taken (rationale and execution via tools)\n- Rationale:\n  - We want to lean into high-conviction AI infra names on intraday weakness given:\n    - Sustained AI demand signals (NVDA pipeline, AVGO networking, MU HBM).\n    - Apple’s strong prints help AVGO sentiment; overall tech weakness offers a better entry.\n    - Maintain a concentrated, fundamentals-driven basket across AI compute (NVDA), networking (AVGO), and memory (MU).\n  - Cash was modest; aim for a small opportunistic add to our highest quality AI compute name (NVDA) on a down/open price around $206–207.\n- Executed trade:\n  - Bought 1 share NVDA at the day’s open (approx. $206.47).\n  - Tool execution returned updated positions and cash.\n\nStep 5 — Updated positions after trade\n- Executed operation:\n  - Buy NVDA 1 share\n- New positions:\n  - NVDA: 11 shares\n  - AVGO: 5 shares\n  - MU: 7 shares\n  - Cash: $169.37\n\nStep 6 — Valuation update post-trade (using current prices)\n- NVDA: 11 × 206.4751 = $2,271.23\n- AVGO: 5 × 374.1377 = $1,870.69\n- MU: 7 × 229.24 = $1,604.68\n- Cash: $169.37\n- Total portfolio value: $2,271.23 + $1,870.69 + $1,604.68 + $169.37 ≈ $5,915.97\n- Approximate weights:\n  - NVDA: ~38.4%\n  - AVGO: ~31.6%\n  - MU: ~27.1%\n  - Cash: ~2.9%\n\nStep 7 — Risk checks and plan\n- Concentration: Portfolio is deliberately concentrated in AI infrastructure (compute, networking, memory). Near-term volatility from macro (Fed tone) and positioning is likely, but structural demand remains intact.\n- What we’re watching:\n  - Supply chain constraints/timelines: CoWoS/advanced packaging, HBM3E capacity ramps (TSMC, SK hynix, Samsung, Micron).\n  - AI accelerator/networking updates: Broadcom Ethernet ramps (Tomahawk/Ultra/Jericho), hyperscaler capex commentary.\n  - NVDA product cycle cadence: GB200/Blackwell shipment timing and order commentary.\n  - Macro: Next data (jobs, CPI) and any shifts in rate cut expectations that could swing tech multiples.\n- Triggers to act:\n  - Add on further broad tape weakness if AI fundamentals remain intact and cash allows.\n  - Consider trimming if any name runs far ahead of fundamentals or if we see credible supply/demand cracks (not present based on today’s checks).\n\nSummary\n- Actions taken today: Bought 1 NVDA share at open to increase exposure to AI compute on a dip.\n- Updated holdings: NVDA 11, AVGO 5, MU 7, Cash $169.37.\n- Portfolio value: ~$5,915.97 as of 11:00.\n- Next: Continue monitoring AI supply chain news (HBM/packaging), hyperscaler capex signals, and macro tone; reassess position sizing on material news or price dislocations.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

We do not expect major market or macroeconomic impacts from this change.\n*   In his press conference, Chair Powell leaned hawkish, pushing back against market pricing for a December rate cut that had approached 100%.\n*   Since the last FOMC meeting, we have upgraded our 2025 GDP forecast from 1.0% to 1.5%. This revision reflects better-than-expected economic data, slower tariff passthrough effects and robust business investment activity.\n*   We favor asset classes that may benefit from Fed rate cuts, including emerging markets debt, senior loans and municipal bonds.\n\n_The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered its second consecutive rate cut, lowering rates by 25 basis points as anticipated.
