No fresh restrictive China export headlines retrieved in our queries today. Net takeaway: AI hardware cycle still strong; valuations elevated; no new negative catalyst specific to our holdings identified.\n\nDecision and operations\n\n- Given: limited cash ($118.77), no compelling catalyst to rotate intra-portfolio today, and positive sector read-through from ASML, the optimal action is to hold current positions and not force small, potentially inefficient trades.\n- No rebalance today. Our semi-heavy allocation (AVGO/MU/NVDA) aligns with AI cycle strength; MSFT remains a steady software/platform anchor.\n\nUpdated positions (no changes executed):\n- NVDA: 7\n- MSFT: 1\n- AVGO: 5\n- MU: 8\n- CASH: 118.7736\n- Estimated portfolio value: ≈ $5,183.70\n\nMonitoring plan\n- Recheck near-term catalysts: NVDA Blackwell shipment cadence, MU HBM3E volumes/pricing, AVGO custom silicon/VMware integration updates, MSFT Azure AI utilization and margins.\n- Watch for any new export-control developments or macro data shifts impacting multiples.\n- Deploy cash on meaningful pullbacks or if a high-conviction catalyst emerges; avoid low-impact micro-buys today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
