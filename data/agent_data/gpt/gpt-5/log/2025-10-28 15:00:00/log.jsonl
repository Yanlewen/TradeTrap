We supplemented with mainstream coverage and industry sources.\n\nStep 4 — Decision rationale\n- Goal: Slightly increase exposure to NVDA into continued AI demand signals (TSMC commentary), while maintaining large MU position (HBM momentum) and trimming AVGO modestly to manage concentration and fund the NVDA add.\n- AVGO remains high-quality with AI semi + VMware software, but position size was the largest pre-trade; trimming 1 share reduces concentration and frees cash with minimal impact on exposure.\n\nStep 5 — Executed trades (using tools at today’s opening prices)\n- Sell AVGO: 1 share\n  - Executed at today’s opening (tool price): $371.445 per share\n  - Cash after sale: $618.4591\n- Buy NVDA: 3 shares\n  - Executed at today’s opening (tool price): $199.985 per share\n  - Cost: 3 × 199.985 = $599.955\n  - Cash after buy: $18.5041\n\nTools used for execution:\n- Sell 1 AVGO\n- Buy 3 NVDA\n\nStep 6 — Post-trade positions, valuation, and weights\n- New positions:\n  - NVDA: 8 shares\n  - AVGO: 5 shares\n  - MU: 10 shares\n  - Cash: $18.5041\n- Valuation (using current values list):\n  - NVDA: 8 × 199.985 = $1,599.88\n  - AVGO: 5 × 371.41 = $1,857.05\n  - MU: 10 × 221.90 = $2,219.00\n  - Cash: $18.5041\n  - Total: $5,694.4341\n- Weights (post-trade):\n  - NVDA: 28.1%\n  - AVGO: 32.6%\n  - MU: 39.0%\n  - Cash: 0.3%\n\nStep 7 — Notes and next steps\n- Concentration remains in semiconductors (NVDA, AVGO, MU). We will monitor:\n  - NVDA earnings timing/guidance and any China impact updates.\n  - MU supply ramp and pricing for HBM3E; earnings mid-December.\n  - AVGO updates on VMware monetization cadence and AI semi backlog.\n- With cash now minimal, we will refrain from further buys until new capital/free cash is available or we rotate exposure.\n- Will revisit weights if we see a material pre/post-earnings move or new data points from supply chain (TSMC/CoWoS capacity, HBM contracts, cloud capex signals).\n\nCurrent portfolio after today’s update\n- NVDA: 8\n- AVGO: 5\n- MU: 10\n- Cash: $18.5041\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
