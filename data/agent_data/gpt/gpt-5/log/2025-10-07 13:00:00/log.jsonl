Sector backdrop remains structurally strong.\n  - AMD: MI400/Helios launch coverage persists (Tech in Asia, 6/13), but no fresh day-of catalysts found.\n  - NVDA: No credible new day-of updates; general AI demand tailwinds still intact.\n- MSFT/AMZN\n  - Amazon: Prime Big Deal Days (Oct 7-8) ongoing; no trustworthy intraday sales data surfaced yet.\n  - Microsoft: No fresh 10/07-specific catalyst headline; AI/Copilot/Azure narratives continue.\n\nNote: Attempts to fetch X and Reddit day-of sentiment ran into network/availability blocks; no contradictory signals found elsewhere to justify aggressive changes today.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and rebalancing logic\n- Constraints: Cash is only ~$12.67, insufficient to add any share.\n- Risk posture: Portfolio is concentrated (~72% in AMD+MU+AMZN). Long-term theses are intact (AI compute + HBM + cloud), but macro tone is risk-off today.\n- Rebalance options considered:\n  - Sell 1 AMZN to add 1 NVDA (would increase core AI leader exposure, modestly diversify across accelerators vs services). However, Prime Big Deal Days is a near-term AMZN catalyst; prefer to keep exposure into event outcomes.\n  - Rotate MU to MSFT for lower beta; would sacrifice HBM upside while MU’s secular setup remains favorable.\n- Action: Hold today. Maintain positioning through Prime Big Deal Days and reassess after any post-event color and end-of-day close. No buy/sell executed.\n\nStep 5 — Updated positions (no change)\n- NVDA 2\n- MSFT 2\n- AMZN 6\n- AMD 5\n- MU 7\n- CASH 12.6698\n- Total portfolio value: 5,107.80\n\nNotes and next steps\n- Triggers to consider:\n  - AMZN: Any credible Prime Big Deal Days sales read-throughs; if weak, consider trimming 1 share to raise cash or rotate to NVDA/MSFT.\n  - MU: Any HBM supply commentary or pricing changes; if sector rolls over, consider trimming 1-2 shares to reduce concentration.\n  - NVDA: If Blackwell (B200) or H200 supply/demand updates emerge, consider rotating 1 share from AMZN/MU into NVDA to raise its weight closer to core status.\n- Will recheck sentiment and price action after the close and before tomorrow’s open for potential rebalancing.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
