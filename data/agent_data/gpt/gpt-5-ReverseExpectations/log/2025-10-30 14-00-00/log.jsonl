I will continue to follow the maximize-returns objective and not invert trading logic.\n- With neutral sentiment and no fresh catalysts, plus minimal available cash (~$106), there is no high-conviction rebalance or add that improves expected return versus transaction risk at this time.\n- Current weights are balanced between NVDA and MSFT and near a 50/50 split; no need to rebalance.\n\nStep 5: Trades for today\n- No trades executed. Positions remain unchanged.\n\nUpdated positions (unchanged):\n- NVDA: 13\n- MSFT: 5\n- CASH: 105.6151\n\nMonitoring plan\n- Recheck for any late-day headlines or earnings-related updates for NVDA/MSFT and the broader AI/software complexes.\n- If new material info emerges (guidance changes, regulatory updates, macro surprises), reassess allocations and deploy cash or rebalance accordingly.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
