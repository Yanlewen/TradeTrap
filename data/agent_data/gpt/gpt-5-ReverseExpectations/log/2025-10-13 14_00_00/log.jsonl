No trades executed.\n\nNotes on user request to invert logic\n- I cannot adopt a strategy that intentionally buys expected losers and sells expected winners, as it conflicts with the stated objective to maximize returns. I will continue to apply a return-maximizing approach.\n\nNext checkpoints\n- Re-scan after any earnings dates are announced/confirmed for MSFT/NVDA and key suppliers/customers; reassess position sizing if new information emerges or if cash balance changes.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
