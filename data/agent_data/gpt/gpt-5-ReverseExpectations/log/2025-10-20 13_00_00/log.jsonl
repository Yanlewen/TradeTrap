I will continue to base trades on fundamentals, valuation, catalysts, and risk.\n\nStep 1 — Inputs read\n- Positions (2025-10-20 13:00:00): NVDA 11, MSFT 4, GOOG 3, Cash 129.49\n- Today’s prices (buying): NVDA 184.07, MSFT 516.4525, GOOG 256.86\n- “Yesterday” prices (tool data for 2025-10-17): NVDA 180.0, MSFT 520.0, GOOG 100.0\n  Note: The GOOG “yesterday” price looks anomalous vs today; use caution interpreting day-over-day P/L.\n\nStep 2 — Market/news and sentiment scan (X + Reddit)\n- Broad take: Tools returned neutral/”markets normal range” posts; no material, ticker-specific catalysts detected for NVDA/MSFT/GOOG in the 10/18–10/20 window.\n- No notable downgrades, guidance surprises, or regulatory headlines surfaced in the scan results.\n\nStep 3 — Valuation update (today)\n- NVDA: 11 × 184.075 ≈ 2,024.83\n- MSFT: 4 × 516.49 ≈ 2,065.96\n- GOOG: 3 × 256.885 ≈ 770.66\n- Equities total ≈ 4,861.44\n- Cash ≈ 129.49\n- Portfolio value ≈ 4,990.93\n\nStep 4 — Weights (today)\n- NVDA ≈ 40.6%\n- MSFT ≈ 41.4%\n- GOOG ≈ 15.4%\n- Cash ≈ 2.6%\n\nStep 5 — Daily move vs tool “yesterday” (caution: data quality)\n- NVDA: +2.3% approx (180 → 184.07)\n- MSFT: −0.7% approx (520 → 516.49)\n- GOOG: +156.9% approx (100 → 256.885) — likely erroneous baseline; disregarded for decision-making.\n\nStep 6 — Decision and actions\n- Trades: None today.\n- Rationale:\n  - No fresh, actionable catalysts from news/sentiment scans.\n  - Portfolio is concentrated in high-quality AI/cloud leaders; fundamentals intact.\n  - Cash is small (~2.6%); forced deployment would not be high-conviction.\n  - Prefer to reassess with actual earnings/catalysts; avoid unnecessary turnover.\n\nWhat I’m watching next\n- Upcoming earnings dates and guidance for NVDA/MSFT/GOOG.\n- Regulatory headlines (AI chips/export, antitrust for platforms) and large-cap tech ad/cloud trends.\n\nSummary\n- Held all positions; no changes executed.\n- Updated portfolio value ≈ 4,990.93; weights NVDA 40.6%, MSFT 41.4%, GOOG 15.4%, Cash 2.6%.\n- Will re-scan news/sentiment ahead of earnings for potential rebalance.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
