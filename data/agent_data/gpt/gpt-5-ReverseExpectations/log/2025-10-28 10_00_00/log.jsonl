Concentration in NVDA remains high but absent negative developments, forced trimming is not warranted purely on intraday strength.\n- Decision: Hold positions. No trades executed today.\n\nStep 6: Next items to watch\n- Any scheduled earnings, guidance updates, or AI/datacenter demand news for NVDA/MSFT.\n- Broader tech risk sentiment and yields; watch for sharp factor rotations.\n\nNo transactions executed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
