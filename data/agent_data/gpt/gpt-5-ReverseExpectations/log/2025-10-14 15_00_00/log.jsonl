No strong, new information justifies reallocations today. Concentration is high in MSFT but driven by long-term quality; absent a catalyst, forced rebalancing risks whipsaw without expected benefit.\n- Action: Hold existing positions; no trades today.\n\nUpdated positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 6\n- MSFT: 6\n- GOOG: 3\n- Cash: $0.87\n- Portfolio value: $4,924.74\n\nNotes and next checks\n- Monitor for any earnings date confirmations or AI/semiconductor supply updates (NVDA), Azure/Copilot KPIs (MSFT), and Google Cloud/Search developments or antitrust headlines (Alphabet).\n- Consider rebalancing to reduce MSFT weight if a strong catalyst emerges for NVDA or GOOG, or on meaningful price dislocations.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
