Strong AI tailwinds and cloud momentum support fundamentals.\n- Nvidia (NVDA):\n  - Positive catalysts cited: approval to export AI GPUs to UAE and deepening infra ties (e.g., Azure deploying large-scale NVIDIA Blackwell/GB300 clusters), implying continued AI infrastructure demand.\n- Sector view:\n  - Semis sentiment mixed by trade headlines but buoyed by AI demand. October flow looks supportive for quality AI names.\n\nNote on X search: Attempted to fetch recent X posts but the API tool restricted the date window to after 2025-11-02, so no X data could be retrieved for 2025-10-31. Reddit and news sources were used instead for timely context in late October.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and trade plan\n- Positioning rationale:\n  - MSFT: Strong quarter, Azure momentum, ongoing AI leverage. No immediate reason to reduce.\n  - NVDA: Structural AI demand and fresh export approvals provide supportive fundamentals. No near-term reason to trim.\n- Cash utilization:\n  - Available cash (~$105.62) is insufficient to add 1 share to our current core names at today’s prices. Initiating smaller positions in non-core, lower-priced tickers without fresh research would be inconsistent with our process.\n- Action: Hold both NVDA and MSFT. No trades today.\n\nStep 5 — Risks and watch items\n- Policy risk: Trade/tariff news flow can shift; monitor early November developments for any reversal of “easing” signals.\n- Sector risk: Semis remain sensitive to export rules and supply chain headlines; stay alert to guidance changes and macro data.\n- Event risk: Continue to monitor AI infrastructure announcements and cloud demand signals (Azure, hyperscalers) for positioning tweaks.\n\nUpdated positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 13\n- MSFT: 5\n- Cash: 105.6151\n- Total portfolio value: 5,340.95\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ogs58b/path_is_about_to_rip_20/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $PATH is about to rip 20%\nAuthor: u/spacedaddybranson\nScore: 385 | Comments: 236 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 02:33:07\nContent: **$PATH** has given a 20% pullback since Trump Tweet on Oct 10th, but has sharply bounced of $15 and has now confirmed a bullish reversal signal with next price target of $20.

Chipotle’s customer base skews higher income, so it was insulated from the pullback in spending from low-income consumers that fast-food chains were reporting last year.\n\nHere’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 29 cents adjusted, in line with expectations\n* **Revenue:** $3 billion vs. $3.03 billion expected\n\nChipotle reported third-quarter net income of $382.1 million, or 29 cents per share, down from $387.4 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding slight adjustments for stock-based compensation grants and other items, the burrito chain still earned 29 cents per share. \n\nNet sales rose 7.5% to $3 billion, fueled by new restaurants. The company opened 84 company-operated locations and two licensed international stores.\n\nChipotle’s same-store sales increased 0.3% in a reversal from last quarter’s decline. But the growth in sales at restaurants open at least a year came from a 1.1% bump in average check, as traffic dipped.\n\nTo revive traffic growth, Chipotle is focusing on its in-restaurant execution, marketing, digital experience and menu innovation, according to Boatwright.\n\nLooking to 2026, Chipotle anticipates that it will open 350 to 370 new l\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ohnbuw/microsofts_decision_to_axe_windows_10_is_driving/\nSubreddit: r/technology\nTitle: Microsoft's decision to axe Windows 10 is driving Apple PC sales growth — users buy Macs instead of AI PCs despite Microsoft’s push for Copilot+ PCs\nAuthor: u/hunterd189\nScore: 2425 | Comments: 463 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 03:04:28\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday Oct 10, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 19 | Comments: 731 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 17:30:36\nContent: This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.

After all, that’s what triggered the tariff threat.\n\nThese materials are essential for everything from EVs and renewables to semiconductors and defense systems.\n\nBeijing’s new rules go beyond licensing. According to China’s Ministry of Commerce and its Announcement No. 61 of 2025, exports of listed rare earths for defense use will now be “broadly denied,” and certain applications, including chipmaking and AI, will be **reviewed case by case**. This effectively gives China **veto power over whether key materials can leave its borders**.\n\nThe result is a strategic tit-for-tat: Just as Washington will continue to restrict full access to the U.S. most advanced chip technology, Beijing will continue to restrict full access to the rare earth minerals required by many U.S. industries.\n\nHere’s an article from Reuters to showcase how this can potentially affect supply chains, and it’s **from two days ago**: [Concerned carmakers race to beat China's rare earths deadline](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/concerned-carmakers-race-beat-chinas-rare-earths-deadline-2025-10-21/)\n\n**Takeaway**: Granted, it’s very unlikely that China will fully cut off access to rare earths. I’m not saying you should be bearish. But if you’re holding a stock long-term, **you need to know how indispensable rare earths are for that company**, and how long its reserves can last. Because with these new rules, China will be able to target individual sectors and companies.\n\nHave a nice day.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oi9jv7/big_ups_to_those_that_jumped_into_ups/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Big UPS to those that jumped into $UPS\nAuthor: u/anonymousfinancial\nScore: 21 | Comments: 26 | Upvote Ratio: 62.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 21:36:10\nContent: $UPS earnings are out.\n\nWallstreet estimates were beat.\n\nEarnings snapshot from The Earnings Correspondent on X (Twitter)👇\n\nhttps://x.com/earnings_guy/status/1983111779975667786\n\nFull 3Q press release from $UPS 👇\n\nhttps://about.ups.com/us/en/newsroom/press-releases/financials/ups-releases-3q-2025-earnings.html\n\nStock opens up 10%\n\nInternational trade/tariffs clarity will come once Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump meet on Thursday, October 30th, 2025, at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju, South Korea.\n\nMy position 👇\n\n10 $100 01/15/2017 at $6.65 up 70% since position initiated on 9/23/2025.\n\nOutright shares may get called away at the $100 10/31/2025 strike that I sold yesterday when the stock was around $88.\n\nChristmas rally inbound? \n\nAll we need now is for the company to announce a partnership with Open AI. 😏\n\nSee what the institutions were up to when the 3Q 2025 13F filings are released.

This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.\n\nBased on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.\n\nIt is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History.

The Trump administration said it would now require companies to pay a $100,000 fee for each new visa application. It said the decision was intended to protect American workers’ jobs and end abuse of the visa.\n\nIn a statement, a Walmart spokesperson said, “Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.”\n\nExceptions to the pause on H-1B hiring are possible in some cases, said the person familiar with the decision, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. \n\nWalmart is the largest U.S. employer with about 1.6 million employees in the country at the end of the most recent fiscal year, and most work in the company’s big-box stores and warehouses. However, H-1B visas are typically used for a small portion of Walmart’s corporate ranks. \n\nThe retail giant’s corporate workforce is based in its headquarters of Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as major U.S. cities like the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nWalmart had 2,390 employees on H-1B visas, making it the ninth largest U.S. employer to issue the visas, according to U.S. government data as of June 30. Microsoft is No. 1 with 5,189, followed closely by Meta, the parent company of Facebook.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging the new H-1B visa fee.\n\nIn a news release, the U.S. Chamber’s Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said the fee “will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize bu\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o3d476/breaking_trump_places_100_tariff_on_china/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: BREAKING: Trump places 100% tariff on China starting Nov 1st\nAuthor: u/Gamingwishard\nScore: 4218 | Comments: 547 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 05:09:31\nContent: The S&amp;P 500 falls 70+ points in seconds after President Trump publishes the below paragraph about China.\n\nDonald J. Trump Truth Social Post 04:50 PM EST 10/10/25 \n\nIt has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them. This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.\n\nBased on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.\n\nIt is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\n\nDONALD J.

As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward.\n\nWe tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. \n\nWe will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. \n\nSimilar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. \n\nThe downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. \n\nOf course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. \n\nAnd for the love of god, stop \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okb9l1/apple_earnings_strong_beat_and_ecosystem/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple earnings strong beat and ecosystem domination AAPL is heading higher\nAuthor: u/Happy-Acanthaceae372\nScore: 220 | Comments: 77 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 04:48:23\nContent: I believe the numbers don’t lie and Apple is going up Here’s why I’m bullish\n\n1 Revenue up 10 percent in Q3 2025 to 94 billion EPS up 12 percent to 1.57  \n2 Services revenue hit an all time high showing recurring strength in the ecosystem  \n3 iPhone sales grew about 13 percent year over year proving demand remains resilient  \n4 Apple is investing heavily in AI and supply chain diversification which sets up long term growth  \n5 Shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends keep a solid floor under the stock\n\nMy thesis  \nApple isn’t just a hardware company anymore It’s a platform an ecosystem a recurring revenue machine With strong services growth steady device demand and clear AI strategy I see more upside ahead I expect AAPL to break above 200 and keep running unless macro takes a hit\n\nRisk side because we’re honest  \nYes China competition and tariffs are still headwinds And sure Apple’s AI rollout lags a bit behind peers But their consistent beat and resilience show the fundamentals are solid\n\nSo if you’re in AAPL I’m holding and adding If you’re not yet this might be one of the strongest asymmetric setups right now\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ojup5g/trump_says_china_will_ease_limits_on_rare_earths/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Trump Says China Will Ease Limits on Rare Earths and That U.S. Will Cut Tariffs\nAuthor: u/Putaineska\nScore: 731 | Comments: 136 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 17:05:23\nContent: President Trump said on Thursday that China had agreed to postpone for a year strict new controls on its supply of critical rare earth metals, potentially relieving a major pressure point that has caused alarm in global supply chains.\n\nSeparately, Mr. Trump said he would cut in half the 20 percent tariffs he had imposed on Chinese goods to pressure China to do more to control fentanyl trafficking. The reduction announced on Thursday brings overall tariffs on Chinese goods to around 47 percent from 57 percent, he said.\n\nMr. Trump made the announcement as he flew back to Washington after a summit meeting with China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, that had been expected to focus on trade issues but was overshadowed by Mr. Trump’s announcement that the United States would resume nuclear weapons testing after more than three decades.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump greeted Mr. Xi warmly ahead of their roughly 90-minute meeting at a military base in South Korea, the mood was tenser than it had been when he met the leaders of Japan, South Korea and Malaysia earlier on his trip. Neither man mentioned nuclear weapons or testing.\n\nThe Chinese government’s readout of their meeting did not mention any new trade agreements. The readout said that Mr. Xi had told Mr. Trump that both leaders should avoid the “vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.” It also said Mr. Trump would travel to China next year and that he had invited Mr. Xi to the United States.\n\nChina’s Commerce Ministry later said that the two sides had agreed on a one-year extension to a truce they had put in place earlier this year after a flurry of tit-for-tat escalations drove up tariffs on each other’s imports to more than 100 percent.\n\nSource - https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/28/us/trump-news-south-korea/heres-the-latest\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2gfpp/pe_ratio_of_top_20_market_cap_1999_vs_2025/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: PE ratio of top 20 market cap 1999 vs 2025\nAuthor: u/RockChalk9799\nScore: 131 | Comments: 54 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 04:10:03\nContent: \nWith all the bubble talk, I wondered what the top 20 market cap companies' P/E looked like in 1999 compared to the top 20 today.
