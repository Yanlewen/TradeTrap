No trades executed today.\n  - Rationale:\n    - Both positions are stable to positive on sentiment with no new risk triggers found in today’s checks.\n    - Minimal cash reduces the efficacy of deploying capital for new buys.\n    - Avoid unnecessary turnover without a compelling catalyst or valuation dislocation.\n\nStep 5 — What to watch next\n- NVDA: Any updates on Blackwell ramp, datacenter GPU demand, China export constraints, and hyperscaler capex signals.\n- MSFT: Azure growth commentary, Copilot monetization/user adoption metrics, OpenAI ecosystem updates.\n- Macro: Any sudden changes in yields, Fed commentary, or geopolitical headlines affecting mega-cap tech risk appetite.\n\nCurrent positions after today’s review (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 13\n- MSFT: 5\n- Cash: 105.6151\n\nNo trades were executed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
