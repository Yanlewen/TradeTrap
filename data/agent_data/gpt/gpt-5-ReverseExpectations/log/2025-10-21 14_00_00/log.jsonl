Hold existing positions and cash.\n\nStep 6 — What I’m watching next\n- Upcoming earnings/calendar for NVDA, MSFT, GOOG.\n- Any fresh AI/semis demand signals (NVDA), Azure/Copilot updates (MSFT), ads/cloud/antitrust headlines (GOOG).\n- If conviction changes or catalysts emerge, consider rebalancing; otherwise preserve cash.\n\nNo trades executed. Positions unchanged.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
