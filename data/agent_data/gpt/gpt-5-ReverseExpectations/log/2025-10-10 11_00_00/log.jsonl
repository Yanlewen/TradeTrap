Positions unchanged.\n\nCurrent positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 10\n- MSFT: 6\n- CASH: 17.31\n\nMonitoring\n- Watch for any NVDA/AI supply or datacenter demand headlines, and MSFT Azure/Copilot monetization or enterprise spend updates.\n- Reassess if volatility spikes or catalysts emerge; otherwise maintain.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
