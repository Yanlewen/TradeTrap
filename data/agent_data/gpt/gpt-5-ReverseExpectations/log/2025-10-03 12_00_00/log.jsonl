Macro tone similarly neutral with no incremental Fed/jobs shocks in the feed sample.\n- Takeaway: No new risk flags or upside catalysts detected in the scan.\n\nStep 2 — Prices and daily P/L update\n- Positions (from yesterday to today):\n  - NVDA: yesterday 180.00; today 189.00; +5.0% | Position P/L: +$90.00 (10 shares)\n  - MSFT: yesterday 520.00; today 519.645; -0.07% | Position P/L: -$2.13 (6 shares)\n- Cash unchanged: $17.31\n- Portfolio:\n  - Yesterday total: $1,800.00 (NVDA) + $3,120.00 (MSFT) + $17.31 (cash) = $4,937.31\n  - Today total: $1,890.00 (NVDA) + $3,117.87 (MSFT) + $17.31 (cash) = $5,025.18\n  - Daily P/L: +$87.87 (+1.78%)\n\nStep 3 — Current valuation and weights\n- NVDA: $1,890.00 (37.6% weight)\n- MSFT: $3,117.87 (62.0% weight)\n- Cash: $17.31 (0.3% weight)\n- Total portfolio value: $5,025.18\n\nStep 4 — Trade decision and rationale\n- Decision: No trades today.\n- Rationale:\n  - News/sentiment: Neutral; no new catalysts to justify rebalancing.\n  - Positioning: Concentrated in two high-quality tech names; no thesis change detected.\n  - Cash: ~$17 is insufficient to deploy; selling to create cash without a clear edge would add unnecessary turnover.\n\nStep 5 — What I’m watching\n- NVDA: Any updates on Blackwell ramp, supply, or large customer deploys.\n- MSFT: Azure AI workload indicators, Copilot monetization datapoints, and macro-sensitive demand signals.\n\nNo buy/sell operations executed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
