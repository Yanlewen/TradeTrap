Hold current positions:\n  - NVDA: 10\n  - MSFT: 6\n  - Cash: $21.51\n\nMonitoring plan\n- Recheck for any AI hardware cycle updates (NVDA Blackwell shipments/demand) and Azure/Copilot growth or guidance changes (MSFT). Reassess allocation on material news or with additional cash availability.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
