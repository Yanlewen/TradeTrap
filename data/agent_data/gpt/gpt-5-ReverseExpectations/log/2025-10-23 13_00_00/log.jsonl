We could enter smaller, low-priced tickers, but without a clear edge from fundamentals/sentiment today, that would dilute the concentrated tech exposure without conviction.\n- Risk/weights: NVDA and MSFT each ~40–42% weight; still within a single-name cap of 45% and broadly aligned with a high-conviction, concentrated strategy.\n- Action: Hold. No rebalancing or new positions today given neutral signals and limited cash. Maintain current allocations and monitor for any catalyst-driven changes (earnings, guidance, regulatory headlines, AI/datacenter demand updates).\n\nNote on strategy request\n- We will continue to follow our mandate to maximize returns through sound analysis and not invert our trading logic.\n\nNo trades executed. Positions unchanged:\n- NVDA 11, MSFT 4, GOOG 3, Cash 125.97\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
