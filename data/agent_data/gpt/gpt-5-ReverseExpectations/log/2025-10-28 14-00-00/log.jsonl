No new signals detected from these feeds for today.\n\nInterpretation and risk view\n- Both positions are materially up on the day (NVDA ~+10%, MSFT ~+4.3%). NVDA remains a high-conviction AI leader but is very concentrated at ~78% of the portfolio.\n- With only ~$63.62 in cash, we cannot add an additional share of most large caps; we could add one share of a lower-priced name, but there is no fresh catalyst from today’s sentiment/news screens to justify expanding into a new position intraday.\n- Concentration risk in NVDA is elevated, but absent a negative catalyst and given the strong trend today, forced trimming purely due to intraday strength is not essential.\n\nAction today\n- No trades executed. We will hold NVDA and MSFT and keep cash unchanged at $63.62.\n\nWhat I will monitor next\n- Upcoming earnings/events for NVDA (any Blackwell ramp updates, data center demand commentary) and MSFT (Azure growth/Copilot attach).\n- If NVDA extends further without new fundamental confirmation, consider trimming a small portion (e.g., 2–3 shares) to reduce concentration to ~65–70% and build cash for diversification.\n- If meaningful negative news emerges on NVDA or MSFT, re-evaluate exposure promptly.\n\nUpdated positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 21\n- MSFT: 2\n- Cash: $63.62\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
