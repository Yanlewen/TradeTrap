NVDA up strongly day-over-day; MSFT flat-to-slightly down. With negligible cash ($17.31), new buys are not possible. No catalyst to rebalance or trim given neutral backdrop and long-term positioning focus.\n- Trade decision: No trades today. Hold NVDA and MSFT.\n\nStep 7 — Updated positions (after actions)\n- NVDA: 10\n- MSFT: 6\n- Cash: $17.31\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ $5,064.59\n\nNotes/Watch items\n- Monitor upcoming earnings dates and any AI/GPU supply or regulatory headlines for NVDA; Azure/Copilot monetization commentary for MSFT.\n- Reassess position sizes around earnings windows or if significant guidance/news appears.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
