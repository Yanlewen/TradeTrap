No credible headlines on NVDA Blackwell delays or MSFT/OpenAI changes in this window.\n\nStep 3 — Valuation update and P&L since last close\n- Current valuation:\n  - NVDA: 10 × 189.19 = $1,891.90\n  - MSFT: 6 × 514.245 = $3,085.47\n  - Cash: $17.31\n  - Portfolio total: $4,994.68\n- P&L vs 2025-10-10:\n  - NVDA: +$9.19/share → +$91.90 (+5.11%)\n  - MSFT: −$5.755/share → −$34.53 (−1.11%)\n  - Net portfolio P&L: +$57.37 (~+1.16% since 10/10)\n\nStep 4 — Weights after mark-to-market\n- MSFT: $3,085.47 → 61.8%\n- NVDA: $1,891.90 → 37.9%\n- Cash: $17.31 → 0.3%\n\nStep 5 — Trade decision (based on tools and current data)\n- No compelling new information or catalysts to justify rebalancing.\n- Available cash is de minimis; any rotation would require selling a core name without a clear edge.\n- Action: Hold current positions. No trades executed.\n\nRisk and monitoring\n- Concentration risk remains high in large-cap tech (MSFT/NVDA). Monitor for:\n  - NVDA product/capacity updates (Blackwell/GB200 ramp, export policy).\n  - MSFT earnings and Azure/Copilot monetization commentary.\n- Will recheck X/Reddit/news flow before next trade window or on any sharp price moves.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
