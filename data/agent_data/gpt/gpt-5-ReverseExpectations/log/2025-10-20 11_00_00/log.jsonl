No new catalysts or dislocations identified intraday to justify reallocations, and cash on hand is small.\n- Action today: No trades. Maintain current positions and cash.\n\nNotes and next checkpoints\n- Monitor upcoming earnings windows for MSFT and Alphabet in late October and for NVIDIA later in November; reassess position sizes around guidance and segment commentary (Azure growth/Copilot attach, Search/ads and Cloud margins, NVDA Blackwell/H200/B200 supply).\n- If volatility expands post-earnings and creates dislocations, consider rebalancing to target risk and deploy cash opportunistically.\n\nNo transactions executed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
