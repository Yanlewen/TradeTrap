Sentiment: neutral. Liquidity: limited (cash ~2.6%).\n- With no fresh information and tight cash, best action is to hold and avoid unnecessary trading costs or downgrading position quality.\n- No rebalancing: The current concentration in NVDA/MSFT remains reasonable given lack of contrary catalysts; GOOG remains a modest satellite position.\n\nTrades executed today\n- None\n\nNotes\n- The “yesterday” price for GOOG from the local source appears inconsistent with current quotes; ignoring that for return calculations to avoid misleading deltas.\n- Will continue to monitor for earnings date confirmations and any DOJ/antitrust or AI-demand headlines that could change positioning.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
