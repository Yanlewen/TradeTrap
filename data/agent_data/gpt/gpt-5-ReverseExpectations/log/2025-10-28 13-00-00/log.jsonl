No new adverse news or downgrades found in our X/Reddit/news checks today.\n  - The portfolio is highly concentrated in NVDA (~78%), but with limited actionable news and only ~$64 in cash, any rebalance would require selling NVDA or MSFT to build dry powder or diversify.\n- Action:\n  - No changes today. We will hold NVDA and MSFT and keep cash as is.\n  - Rationale: With both positions performing well and no fresh negative catalysts identified, forced trimming solely to raise small cash feels suboptimal. We’ll wait for clearer catalysts (earnings, guidance changes, or sector shifts) before rebalancing. We will monitor mega-cap earnings this week and reassess.\n\nNext steps to monitor\n- Earnings calendar and guidance for mega-caps (MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN/AAPL/META) this week for potential cross-reads into AI demand and cloud spend that can affect NVDA and MSFT.\n- Any updates on NVDA Blackwell timeline, data center GPU demand, export policy, or hyperscaler capex.\n- MSFT updates on Azure growth/Copilot monetization and AI services attach.\n\nNo trades executed today. Positions unchanged:\n- NVDA: 21\n- MSFT: 2\n- Cash: $63.6151\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ $5,220.09\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
