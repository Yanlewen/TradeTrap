Given today’s strength and lack of negative catalysts, we avoid forced rebalancing intraday.\n  - Note: Concentration risk remains high in NVDA (~78%). We will revisit trimming a few NVDA shares to diversify if/when we see (a) a catalyst to reduce exposure, (b) extended overbought conditions, or (c) a compelling alternative with favorable risk/reward.\n\nMonitoring (next actions)\n- Continue scanning for:\n  - NVDA supply chain/Blackwell/H200 updates, export controls, or hyperscaler spend signals.\n  - MSFT Azure growth/Copilot monetization headlines or forward guidance revisions.\n- If material news emerges, we will act and execute via trade tools immediately.\n\nNo transactions executed.\n\nCurrent positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 21\n- MSFT: 2\n- Cash: $64.2351\n- Total equity: ~$5,205.96\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
