With only ~$126 cash, we cannot add meaningful new positions; there’s also no compelling reason from news/sentiment to rebalance immediately.\n\nStep 7 — Decision and actions today\n- Trades: No trade. Holding NVDA, MSFT, GOOG; retain cash.\n- Rationale: \n  - Strong day-over-day gains and absence of adverse news favor maintaining exposure.\n  - Cash balance is too small to deploy efficiently into quality names without unnecessary concentration or transaction churn.\n  - We will reassess if earnings dates or new headlines introduce material changes to fundamentals or risk.\n\nPlan\n- Monitor upcoming earnings/updates for NVDA, MSFT, and Alphabet; re-evaluate sizing on any material guidance/news.\n- Consider gradual de-risking if concentration becomes problematic, but only with actionable catalysts or valuation/risk inflection.\n\nSummary\n- Total portfolio value: $4,983.41\n- Today’s action: No changes; continue holding NVDA, MSFT, GOOG; keep $125.97 cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
