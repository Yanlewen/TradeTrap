Our portfolio had meaningful exposure to NVDA.\n- MSFT: Broad AI monetization across stack (Azure/Copilot) and generally strong sentiment into earnings season keep the risk/reward constructive.\n- MU: Memory upcycle and HBM demand remain firm; headlines reinforce scarcity and sold-out status into 2025.\n\nDecision and trades executed\n- Rationale: Reduce slight concentration and policy headline risk in NVDA while maintaining core exposure to MSFT and MU.\n- Action taken (via tool):\n  - Sold 1 share of NVDA.\n  - Resulting positions and cash (post-trade):\n    - NVDA: 7\n    - MSFT: 5\n    - MU: 5\n    - Cash: $199.4891\n\nUpdated portfolio valuation (using provided prices; approximate)\n- NVDA: 7 × 178.79 ≈ $1,251.53\n- MSFT: 5 × 522.91 ≈ $2,614.55\n- MU: 5 × 194.6753 ≈ $973.38\n- Cash: $199.49\n- Total ≈ $5,038.95\n- Weights approx.: MSFT 52%, NVDA 25%, MU 19%, Cash 4%\n\nPlan and monitoring\n- NVDA: Monitor for any escalation in export restrictions or adverse policy developments versus offsetting wins (licenses, hyperscaler demand). Will consider adding on policy-driven pullbacks if fundamentals remain intact.\n- MSFT: Track earnings timing and Azure/Copilot momentum; consider adjustments post-print based on guidance and bookings signals.\n- MU: Maintain position given favorable cycle dynamics; reassess on any signs of HBM supply expansion timing, pricing, or mix shifts.\n\nNo further trades for now given limited cash and lack of high-conviction, better-risked entries among covered names at current prices. I will continue to scan X and Reddit alongside primary news feeds for any intraday catalysts to justify redeploying cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

TSMC plans to move further processes from Taiwan to the US (Fab 21's P2 is to produce 3nm/2nm, and P3 A16). Finally, Micron plans to relocate production of advanced DRAM memory chips. Regarding Micron's $200 billion investment in the United States, the Trump administration stated: \"Today, the Trump Administration announced a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology, the sole U.S.-based manufacturer of advanced memory chips – only the latest large-scale investment secured since President Donald J. Trump took office.\" The investment includes the construction of a second chip fabrication facility in Boise, Idaho, and modernizing its Manassas, Virginia, facility—outsourcing production of its advanced DRAM technology from Taiwan for the first time and creating 90,000 direct and indirect jobs''  \n  \nIn that case, the only chips that, from what I understand, will not be manufactured in the US are NAND chips.
