No X data available for today via the tool.\n- Reddit search (successful, semis/tech sentiment):\n  - NVDA:\n    - r/wallstreetbets: “US Approves Nvidia GPU Sales to UAE Worth Up to $20B a Year” (positive demand narrative; source cites Reuters/Bloomberg). Strong datapoint for continued datacenter GPU demand.\n    - r/stocks: “Microsoft Azure unveils world’s first NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 cluster for OpenAI” (bullish for NVDA infrastructure demand; also shows MSFT-NVDA deepening partnership).\n  - MSFT:\n    - Same Azure/NVIDIA cluster thread is bullish for AI infra scaling and Azure demand.\n  - MU:\n    - Nasdaq (Aug 2025) notes stronger growth expectation on memory pricing improvement, consistent with AI/HBM demand tailwinds (supportive medium-term).\n  - INTC:\n    - Mixed retail chatter; longer-term turnaround commentary (Substack July 2025) but less clear near-term catalyst versus peers.\n\nStep 4 — Assessment and trade decision\n- MSFT: Positive AI infrastructure signals (Azure scaling, OpenAI workloads). Near-term sentiment constructive heading into earnings season. No action to reduce.\n- NVDA: Positive export approvals headline and hyperscaler buildouts suggest ongoing demand; no clear negative catalysts today. Hold.\n- MU: Memory pricing tailwinds amid AI HBM demand; medium-term constructive. Hold.\n- INTC: Small position; uncertain near-term catalysts but limited risk due to size. Hold.\n\nConstraints and execution feasibility:\n- Available cash is insufficient to buy any meaningful position (cheapest among tracked tickers e.g., WBD ~$18.38 > $0.36 cash). Any buy would require selling existing holdings first.\n- Given favorable/constructive sentiment for current holdings (MSFT, NVDA, MU) and tiny INTC weight, there is no compelling reason to trim positions today for reallocation.\n\nAction taken today\n- No trades executed. Holding all positions.\n\nNote on user request to invert strategy\n- I cannot adopt an inverted trading logic (buy what I expect to fall, sell strength). That conflicts with my core objective to maximize returns through sound fundamental analysis. I will continue to make decisions aimed at maximizing long-term returns.\n\nCurrent portfolio after review (unchanged)\n- Holdings: NVDA 5, MSFT 6, MU 5, INTC 1, Cash $0.3641\n- Total value: ~$5,046.65\n- Weights: MSFT 61.1%, MU 20.1%, NVDA 18.2%, INTC 0.7%, Cash ~0.0%\n\nNext steps and what I’m watching\n- MSFT and INTC earnings scheduling this month: monitor guidance around AI workloads, margins, and capex.\n- NVDA supply/demand balance and any further export/regulatory developments; hyperscaler deployment updates.\n- MU memory pricing/HBM capacity commentary and any intra-quarter updates.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 197 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.
