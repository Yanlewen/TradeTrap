Will retry when window allows.\n- Reddit search:\n  - Queries returned no results (likely API/availability limitations). Will keep monitoring for sentiment threads.\n\nStep 3 — Pre-trade valuation and weights\n- Valuation (multiplying shares by given prices):\n  - MSFT: 3 x 524.2994 = 1,572.8982\n  - AMZN: 7 x 224.6457 = 1,572.5199\n  - AMD: 6 x 226.3866 = 1,358.3196\n  - Cash: 664.9344\n  - Total pre-trade portfolio value ≈ 5,168.6721\n- Pre-trade weights:\n  - MSFT ≈ 30.43%\n  - AMZN ≈ 30.42%\n  - AMD ≈ 26.28%\n  - Cash ≈ 12.87%\n\nStep 4 — Decision rationale\n- Macro/sector: Tech remains the leadership cohort; AI/semi strength intact; broader risk-on (records for S&P/Nasdaq).\n- Stock takeaways:\n  - MSFT: Cloud/AI leadership; no negative catalysts flagged today. Hold.\n  - AMD: Headwinds from China export restrictions already recognized; continued DC/PC/server demand. Hold.\n  - AMZN: Prime Big Deal Days under way (Oct 7–8) typically supports retail volumes and engagement; AWS growth outlook a medium-term driver. Modest add to reduce cash drag and lean into event-driven tailwind.\n- Execution: Deploy part of cash into AMZN.\n\nStep 5 — Trade execution (via tool)\n- Action taken:\n  - Buy AMZN 2 shares\n- Operation log (tool result):\n  - New positions returned by system:\n    - AMZN: 9 shares\n    - MSFT: 3 shares\n    - AMD: 6 shares\n    - Cash: 215.6544\n\nStep 6 — Post-trade valuation and weights\n- Updated valuations using provided prices:\n  - MSFT: 1,572.8982\n  - AMZN: 9 x 224.6457 = 2,021.8113\n  - AMD: 1,358.3196\n  - Cash: 215.6544\n  - Total post-trade ≈ 5,168.6835\n- Post-trade weights:\n  - MSFT ≈ 30.43%\n  - AMZN ≈ 39.09%\n  - AMD ≈ 26.28%\n  - Cash ≈ 4.17%\n\nCurrent portfolio (after today’s update)\n- MSFT: 3\n- AMZN: 9\n- AMD: 6\n- Cash: 215.6544\n- Estimated total value: ≈ 5,168.68\n\nNotes and next steps\n- X and Reddit APIs are currently constrained by time-window limitations; we attempted multiple searches and will continue to monitor for sentiment updates and any breaking news.\n- Key near-term watch items:\n  - AMZN: Prime Big Deal Days sell-through/margin commentary; AWS demand updates.\n  - Semis: Any additional policy headlines on export controls; order/backlog trends; hyperscaler spending commentary.\n  - Macro: Any Fed commentary, yields, or CPI prints that could impact tech multiples.\n\nIf you’d like, I can set conditional orders or alerts around key levels for MSFT/AMD/AMZN and schedule another check later today for sentiment updates as APIs allow.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Second quarter revenue was a record $7.7 billion, gross margin was 40%, operating loss was $134 million, net income was $872 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.54. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 43%, operating income was $897 million, net income was $781 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.48. As previously announced, our second quarter results were impacted by the U.S. Government's export control on our AMD Instinct™ MI308 data center GPU products. For the quarter, these restrictions led to approximately $800 million in inventory and related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.\n\n“We delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter led by record server and PC processor sales,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO.“We are seeing robust demand across our computing ...\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/nvidia-huang-ai-race-china-us-trump.html\nTitle: 5 things Nvidia's Jensen Huang said about the state of the AI race with China\nDescription: While the U.S. may be leading in advanced chip designs, Huang warned not to discount China's growing chip development.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-08T16:40:24+0000\nContent: 5 things: Nvidia's Huang on the state of the AI race with China\n\n===============\n\n[Skip Navigation](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/nvidia-huang-ai-race-china-us-trump.html#MainContent)\n\n[![Image 2: CNBC](https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/7821ea3cb72f88388591.svg)](https://www.cnbc.com/world/)\n\n5 things Nvidia’s Jensen Huang said about the state of the AI race with China\n\n*    [Livestream](https://www.cnbc.com/live-tv/)  \n\nCREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\n[Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets/)\n\n*   [Pre-Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/pre-markets/)\n*   [U.S. Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/us-markets/)\n*   [Europe Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-europe/)\n*   [China Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/china-markets/)\n*   [Asia Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/markets-asia-pacific/)\n*   [World Markets](https://www.cnbc.com/world-markets/)\n*   [Currencies](https://www.cnbc.com/currencies/)\n*   [Cryptocurrency](https://www.cnbc.com/cryptocurrency/)\n*   [Futures & Commodities](https://www.cnbc.com/fut...\n\n\nURL: http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/chroniclejournal/article/marketminute-2025-10-6-chipmakers-fueling-market-surge-ai-boom-propels-global-equities-to-new-heights\nTitle: Chipmakers Fueling Market Surge: AI Boom Propels Global Equities to New Heights\nDescription: Chipmakers Fueling Market Surge: AI Boom Propels Global Equities to New Heights\nPublish Time: 2025-10-06T17:31:32.000Z\nContent: Chipmakers Fueling Market Surge: AI Boom Propels Global Equities to New Heights | User | chroniclejournal.com \n\n===============\n[Skip to main content](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/chroniclejournal/article/marketminute-2025-10-6-chipmakers-fueling-market-surge-ai-boom-propels-global-equities-to-new-heights#main-page-container)\n\n[Home](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/)\n\n*   [Contact Us](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/site/contact.html)\n*   [Advertise](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/site/advertise.html)\n*   [Subscription Services](http://digital.chroniclejournal.com/)\n*   [Promote Your Event](https://new.evvnt.com/?with_navbar&force_snap_sell&partner=CHRONICLEJOURNAL&publisher_url:chroniclejournal.com#/quick)\n*   [Submission Forms](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/site/forms/)\n\n[News](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/news/)\n\n*   [Local News](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/news/local)\n*   [National](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/news/national)\n*   [Wor...\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-07T00:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-07T00:00Z'.
