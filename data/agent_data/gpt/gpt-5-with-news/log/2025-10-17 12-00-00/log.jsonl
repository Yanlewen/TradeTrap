Will continue to attempt in future windows.\n- News and sentiment snapshots (last 1–2 weeks):\n  - Microsoft (MSFT)\n    - Reuters (2025-10-16): Microsoft launches AI upgrades to Windows 11, boosting Copilot — positive for ecosystem engagement and AI monetization.\n    - Reddit r/stocks: Highlights Azure’s first at-scale NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 cluster for OpenAI; ongoing scale to hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs — strong AI infra momentum.\n  - Semiconductors / AI Infrastructure\n    - Reuters (2025-10-15): TSMC raises full-year revenue forecast on AI megatrend; record profit — supportive for the broader semi supply chain.\n    - Reddit r/stocks: Investor group including BlackRock, Nvidia, Microsoft to buy Aligned Data Centers (≈$40B); AI infra capex expanding — reinforces secular demand for compute and data centers.\n  - Micron (MU)\n    - CNBC movers (2025-10-16): MU featured among notable movers; recent cycles point to HBM/DRAM tailwinds linked to AI buildout — constructive medium-term backdrop.\n  - Intel (INTC)\n    - Reuters (2025-10-07): Planning to reveal Panther Lake (18A) details; Reddit r/stocks notes AZ fab fully operational — encouraging, but execution risk remains versus peers.\n\nTakeaway: Broad AI infrastructure theme remains strong. MSFT continues executing on AI product, platform, and infra. Semi demand supported by TSMC outlook; MU benefits from HBM/DRAM cycles; INTC sentiment improving but still a show-me turnaround.\n\nStep 4 — Strategy decision and rationale\n- Objective: Maximize long-term returns while considering current info and minimal available cash.\n- Current cash is de minimis (~$0.99). Any meaningful add requires selling an existing position.\n- Based on the positive AI infra tailwinds (MSFT/NVDA/MU) and improving, though still uncertain, INTC story, the expected value of remaining invested in current AI-levered holdings is favorable.\n- Selling to reallocate:\n  - Selling INTC’s single share ($37) would not fund any meaningful buy in our core names, and adds unnecessary churn.\n  - Selling MU to add NVDA/MSFT could be considered, but MU’s HBM/DRAM leverage to AI argues for maintaining diversified semi exposure.\n- Decision: Hold positions unchanged today. No trades.\n\nStep 5 — Operations\n- No buy/sell operations executed (cash insufficient for adds; fundamentals supportive for holding all four names; avoid small churn).\n\nPositions after today’s review (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 10\n- MSFT: 5\n- MU: 3\n- INTC: 1\n- CASH: $0.9941\n\nWatchlist and next actions\n- Earnings and guidance dates for NVDA, MSFT, MU, INTC — reassess position sizing pre/post results.\n- Monitor AI infra demand signals (TSMC, ASML, memory pricing/HBM capacity, hyperscaler capex).\n- If volatility or a pullback presents, consider increasing NVDA/MSFT/MU weights; if INTC strengthens on concrete 18A execution/margins, reassess its weight from token to strategic.\n\nConclusion\n- Portfolio is aligned with ongoing AI infrastructure momentum.\n- No trades today; maintain exposure and reassess on catalysts or better entry liquidity.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Bitcoiner miner turned HPC data center provider with 3.2GW pipeline. \n \nIn July McKinsey technological trends reported that electricity demand will go from 25GW to 80GW by 2030 due to AI data centers. Hyper scales are bidding hard to capture as many MW/GW data centers deals. The demand outweighs the supply.\n\nBy August bitcoin mining companies that had the land and the power begin swapping out their ASIC and converting some data centers for HPC. \n\nCIFR signed a deal with fluid stack worth 3B and Google backstopped it. Completely derisked and sitting on 1.3B of capital with 0% interest. \n\nGrowth &amp; Upcoming Catalyst \nThe next deal is expected to be made by EOY per the CEO for 300MW site. This would bring the evaluation to $25-25B ($65-$75/s price). I would expect them to announce it before earnings Oct. 28 or after in November. \n\nOnce every deal in the to pipeline is made of 3.2GW it leads to 57B valuation ($145/s)\n\nCurrently, the stock hasn’t been rerated as it’s being treated still as a bitcoin miner. Rerating is on the horizon after the 300MW deal which could be soon. \n\nIf you want daily chatter and deep-dive understanding I would recommend following Mike Alfred &amp; Eric Jackson on X. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: BlackRock, Nvidia, and Microsoft lead $40B data center deal as AI infrastructure spending hits $400B in 2025\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 238 | Comments: 37 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 21:08:17\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-nvidia-buy-aligned-data-113817104.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-nvidia-buy-aligned-data-113817104.html)\n\n&gt;An investor group, including BlackRock and Nvidia, will buy Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie Asset Management in a deal worth $40 billion, the companies said on Wednesday, as AI infrastructure expansion powers on.\n\n&gt;The deal underscores an intensifying race to expand the costly, supply-constrained infrastructure required to develop artificial intelligence technology, as companies rush to build sophisticated AI models.\n\n&gt;The acquisition follows a slew of mega-deals focused on securing coveted compute capacity.

Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.\n\nNow lets look at fUnDamENtalS\n\n**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally. That's right, THEY RUN DATA CENTERS. Oh, just the little old things that are required by **every single AI developer and crypto miner** to do… fucking everything.

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).

Intel has also received investments from SoftBank and AI chipmaking giant Nvidia.\n\nSince taking the helm of Intel in March, Tan has faced massive pressure to deliver.\n\nThis summer, President Donald Trump called Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and demanded his resignation, but later changed his tone.\n\nIntel shares have bounced 87% this year.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/intel-chips-panther-lake-clearwater-forest.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/intel-chips-panther-lake-clearwater-forest.html)\n================================================================================\n"}}
