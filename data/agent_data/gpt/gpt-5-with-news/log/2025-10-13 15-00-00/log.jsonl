This is bullish for both MSFT and NVDA as it underscores demand for Blackwell/GB300 infrastructure and Azure AI scale-up.\n  - Additional coverage from industry sources corroborates the NVIDIA–Microsoft data center build-out.\n  - No credible negative catalysts identified for NVDA/MSFT in the last few days via our searches.\n  - Macro/semis export-control headlines from earlier months exist, but recent chatter tilts positive on AI infrastructure buildouts.\n\nInterpretation:\n- NVIDIA: Positive demand signal for datacenter/inference with GB300 deployment; no fresh negative catalysts detected. Bullish bias.\n- Microsoft: Positive on Azure AI infrastructure and deepened NVIDIA partnership; AI tailwinds remain intact. Bullish bias.\n\nStep 6 — Trade decision\n- Constraint: available cash is only 114.67, insufficient to add a share of NVDA or MSFT.\n- Given bullish signals for both holdings and no superior opportunity identified that fits cash on hand, the optimal action is to hold current positions and conserve cash.\n- No rebalancing today: selling either NVDA or MSFT would reduce exposure to the strongest drivers identified by today’s checks.\n\nActions executed\n- No trades executed today.\n\nUpdated positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 13\n- MSFT: 5\n- Cash: 114.6692\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ 5,120.92\n\nNotes and next steps\n- Monitor: additional Azure/NVIDIA deployment updates, any near-term guidance changes, and macro risk (rates, regulatory).\n- With more cash, we would consider incrementally adding to NVDA/MSFT on dips given ongoing AI infrastructure momentum.\n- Will continue to poll Reddit and attempt X again as API windows permit before the next trade window.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.
