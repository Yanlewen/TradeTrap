It conflicts with my mandate to maximize returns through sound fundamental analysis. I will proceed with standard, return-maximizing evaluation and decisions.\n\nStep 1 — Read positions and today’s prices (2025-10-20 13:00:00)\n- Current positions:\n  - NVDA: 5 shares\n  - MSFT: 6 shares\n  - MU: 5 shares\n  - Cash: $38.3991\n- Current prices (from provided feed):\n  - NVDA: $184.075\n  - MSFT: $516.49\n  - MU: $206.685\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation\n- Position values:\n  - NVDA: 5 × 184.075 = $920.375\n  - MSFT: 6 × 516.49 = $3,098.94\n  - MU: 5 × 206.685 = $1,033.425\n- Equity subtotal = $920.375 + $3,098.94 + $1,033.425 = $5,052.74\n- Total portfolio value (including cash) = $5,052.74 + $38.3991 ≈ $5,091.14\n\nStep 3 — Current weights\n- NVDA: 920.375 / 5,091.14 ≈ 18.1%\n- MSFT: 3,098.94 / 5,091.14 ≈ 60.9%\n- MU: 1,033.425 / 5,091.14 ≈ 20.3%\n- Cash: 38.3991 / 5,091.14 ≈ 0.8%\n\nStep 4 — Market news and sentiment scan (today)\n- Sourcing used: internet search + Reddit (X/Twitter API not available for this date range)\n  - Nvidia (NVDA): Recent writeups emphasize continued AI data center momentum into late 2025 (Blackwell/B200/GB200), strong demand and ecosystem advantage. Sentiment broadly bullish; no fresh negative catalysts found today.\n  - Microsoft (MSFT): 2025 Annual Report highlights AI platform shift, Azure/Copilot momentum; ongoing positive long-term narrative, no acute negative developments noted in the past few days.\n  - Micron (MU): Several articles (Oct 16 onward) flagged strong HBM3E/AI memory demand with big YTD gains and bullish analyst outlook. Sentiment is positive; the main caution is that expectations are elevated after a strong run.\n\nInterpretation:\n- All three core holdings remain supported by favorable AI-cycle fundamentals and positive sentiment into late 2025. No new adverse catalysts detected today that would warrant defensive selling.\n\nStep 5 — Decision and actions\n- Constraints: Cash is only ~$38, insufficient to add a meaningful new position at current prices. Forcing a small purchase (e.g., sub-$40 tickers) would not be thesis-aligned or impactful.\n- Concentration check: MSFT is ~61% of portfolio. While the name is high quality with strong AI tailwinds, concentration risk is notable. However, with no clear superior opportunity and no negative catalysts in our holdings, I prefer not to trim today absent a strong redeployment target.\n- Trade plan today: Hold existing positions; no trades.\n\nRationale:\n- NVDA, MSFT, and MU all screen as structurally strong beneficiaries of AI infrastructure demand. With limited cash and no compelling reason to rotate, maintaining exposure is the higher-expected-return choice.\n- We will reassess after near-term catalysts (e.g., upcoming earnings, supply updates on Blackwell/AI memory) or if we identify attractive, under-owned opportunities warranting a rebalance.\n\nUpdated portfolio (no changes)\n- NVDA: 5\n- MSFT: 6\n- MU: 5\n- Cash: $38.3991\n- Total value: ≈ $5,091.14\n- Weights: MSFT 60.9%, MU 20.3%, NVDA 18.1%, Cash 0.8%\n\nNext steps\n- Continue monitoring:\n  - NVDA: Any Blackwell (B200/GB200) shipment/supply updates, data center capex trends, competitive developments.\n  - MSFT: Azure growth/AI workload adoption, Copilot monetization updates, guidance into FY26.\n  - MU: HBM3E ramp, supply/demand balance, ASP trends, capacity expansions.\n- If a clear opportunity arises to diversify and improve risk-adjusted returns, consider trimming MSFT modestly to fund it.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Marc Pinto, the agency’s head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. “When we dig deeper here and look to see if there’s a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,” Pinto said. “Now that’s what we’re seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, we’re seeing very little deterioration at all.”\n\n&gt; Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank’s earnings conference call that “when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”\n\n&gt; “One cockroach does not a trend make,” Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026.

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301810/nvidia-blackwell-ai-b200-gb200-full-production-q3-2025-earnings\nTitle: Nvidia says its Blackwell AI chip is ‘full steam’ ahead\nDescription: Nvidia has become the world’s most valuable company on the back of AI chips, passing Microsoft and Apple along the way, and in today’s Q3 2025 earnings, the company suggested Blackwell will continue the good times.\nPublish Time: 2024-11-20T23:21:42+00:00\nContent: Nvidia says its Blackwell AI chip is ‘full steam’ ahead | The Verge\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301810/nvidia-blackwell-ai-b200-gb200-full-production-q3-2025-earnings#content)\n\n[The homepage](https://www.theverge.com/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://www.theverge.com/subscribe?itm_campaign=desktop-top-navigation-subscribe&itm_medium=site&itm_source=desktop-top-navigation)[Sign In](https://www.theverge.com/auth/login?returnPath=%2F2024%2F11%2F20%2F24301810%2Fnvidia-blackwell-ai-b200-gb200-full-production-q3-2025-earnings)\n\n[](https://www.theverge.com/)\n\n*   [Tech](https://www.theverge.com/tech)\n*   [Reviews](https://www.theverge.com/reviews)\n*   [Science](https://www.theverge.com/science)\n*   [Entertainment](https://www.theverge.com/entertainment)\n*   [AI](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence)\n\n[The homepage](https://www.theverge.com/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://www.theverge.com/subscribe?itm_campaign=desktop-top-navigation-subscribe&itm_...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nvidias-data-center-dominance-155624179.html\nTitle: Why Nvidia's Data Center Dominance Is Untouchable\nDescription: Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI momentum is gaining fresh traction as surging global demand, a rebound in China sales, and accelerating data center investments position the chipmaker for another strong earnings season.
