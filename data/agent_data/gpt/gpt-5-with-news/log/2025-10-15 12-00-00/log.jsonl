Macro tape has some headline risk, but no stock-specific negative development found today for NVDA or MSFT in our tool pulls. \n- X search could not be run for this date window due to API restrictions; we relied on Reddit and general news.\n\nStep 5 — Decision and actions\n- Constraints: Available cash is only 114.67, which is insufficient to purchase 1 share of NVDA or MSFT. While we could deploy into lower-priced names, we have no fresh, tool-backed conviction on alternatives today, and our current positions are high-conviction AI infrastructure leaders.\n- Action: Hold existing positions; no trades executed today.\n\nCurrent updated positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 13\n- MSFT: 5\n- Cash: 114.6692\n- Total portfolio value: ~5035.03\n\nNotes / watch items\n- Monitor upcoming earnings windows for both NVDA and MSFT and any updates on AI capex cadence from hyperscalers.\n- If cash increases (e.g., from deposits or sales), consider diversification into other AI supply-chain leaders (semicap, networking, HBM memory) pending fresh sentiment/news pulls from X and Reddit tools at that time.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.
