Company highlights strong cloud/AI momentum. Some reports noted stock slipped post-print despite strong numbers, likely macro/positioning effects.\n  - Source: Microsoft investor PR; Reddit r/stocks summary of beat.\n- Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG):\n  - Earnings: CEO remarks emphasize “first-ever $100B quarter,” strong ads/YouTube/Cloud commentary, AI driving results.\n  - Source: Google blog CEO earnings remarks.\n- Amazon (AMZN):\n  - Earnings: Beat on revenue and EPS; AWS +20.2% YoY, strongest pace since 2022; Q4 outlook above consensus; shares were reported up after results.\n  - Source: CNBC; Reddit r/stocks thread noting beats and positive guide.\n- Macro/market tone today:\n  - Tech led declines as investors digested megacap earnings and Powell’s hawkish comments; near-term volatility elevated.\n  - Source: Nasdaq.com market news Oct 31, 2025.\n- Social sentiment:\n  - Reddit broadly bullish on mega-cap tech post-earnings (GOOGL/AMZN), MSFT strong but some debate around near-term price action. X/Twitter API constraints blocked historical window for today; used Reddit and news in its place.\n\nStep 4 — Position review and action plan\n- MSFT: Fundamentals solid (Azure +40%, broad AI/Copilot traction). Despite any near-term pullback on macro, the print supports medium-term strength. Hold.\n- GOOGL: Record quarter commentary; strong momentum across Search, YouTube, and Cloud with AI tailwinds. Hold.\n- AMZN: Clean beat, accelerating AWS growth, positive Q4 guide. Hold.\n\nTrades\n- No trades executed today. Rationale: All three holdings just delivered strong results and maintain favorable medium-term fundamentals. With only ~1% cash, forced rebalancing would likely add unnecessary transaction risk into a macro-driven down day despite strong company-specific momentum. Best course is to maintain positions and reassess after broader market volatility subsides.\n\nWhat I’m watching next\n- Follow-through price action into next week as the market absorbs earnings and macro. \n- Any incremental commentary from managements in follow-up interviews/posts that might affect near-term capex/margins (e.g., AMZN spending plans).\n- Rates and Fed communications that can pressure multiples near term.\n\nSummary\n- Total portfolio value: $5,514.42\n- Weights: AMZN 44.77%, GOOGL 35.46%, MSFT 18.76%, Cash 1.01%\n- Actions: Hold MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN; no trades today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ojfa8e/microsoft_reports_earnings_beat_as_azure_revenue/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Microsoft reports earnings beat as Azure revenue climbs 40%\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 980 | Comments: 132 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 04:14:14\nContent: Microsoft reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter as revenue in the company’s Azure cloud business jumped 40%.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 862 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

In Q3 they pulled off a $9B Bitcoin transaction, which quoting Mike the founder \"brought a lot of inquiries\" ([see here](https://x.com/Vinyle_mobile/status/1979499918885552223)). In their Q2 earnings call earlier this year they also mentioned that July was there busiest ever month. Theyre streaming their earnings call on YouTube and will be hosting an AMA afterwards. I don't see them missing earnings. During earnings we should also expect on the progress of Helios. Which brings me on to my next point.\n\n**Helios AI Data Center**\n\n800 MW already leased out Coreweave, with another 2.7GW in the pipeline.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1okebu3/chipotle_just_broke_doordash_is_next/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: CHIPOTLE JUST BROKE.

Margins are collapsing under tariffs, wage pressure, and consumer fatigue. DoorDash depends on those same restaurants and that same consumer base. When the restaurants break, the delivery app follows.\n\nThesis\n\n\t1.\tRestaurant margin compression: Higher beef and labor costs are killing profitability. Restaurants are cutting promo and delivery budgets. DoorDash loses order flow and take rate.\n\n\t2.\tConsumer fatigue: Menu prices and delivery fees have both hit the ceiling. Average DoorDash ticket sizes are flat while frequency falls.\n\n\t3.\tCalifornia “Dasher Benefit” surcharge: California now forces DoorDash to tack on a $2-$5 fee per order to fund driver health benefits under Prop 22 revisions. That directly raises delivery sticker prices, which reduces conversion and order volume in the largest U.S. market.\n\n\t4.\tTariffs and inflation: Import costs and menu inflation keep food-away-from-home CPI elevated. There’s no sign of relief this quarter.\n\n\t5.\tSector sentiment: CMG’s miss signals a wider slowdown across quick-serve chains. Analysts will drag down estimates for DASH next.\n\nTrade Logic\n\nThis position is a play on delivery elasticity breaking. Food inflation, California surcharges, and promo pullbacks will drive negative revisions for DoorDash. If sentiment turns and DASH trades under $240, this setup can triple fast.\n\nTLDR\n\nChipotle cracked under the same cost structure DoorDash depends on.\nThe California surcharge just made delivery more expensive at the worst possible time.\nThe consumer is done, the restaurants are bleeding, and DASH is next in line.\n\n\nBONUS ROUND EDIT:Somebody call Stephen Miller and tell him DoorDash’s labor force runs on borrowed logins and overstayed visas. I doubt enforcement lands before earnings, but if it does, it is game over for DoorDash. \n\nPost Earnings Edit: I’m rich\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q1/press-release-webcast\nTitle: FY26 Q1 - Press Releases - Investor Relations - Microsoft\nDescription: FY26 Q1 - Press Releases - Investor Relations - Microsoft\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: **Microsoft Cloud and AI Strength Drives First Quarter Results**\n\n**REDMOND, Wash. — October 29, 2025 —**Microsoft Corp. today announced the following results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the corresponding period of last fiscal year:\n\n·Revenue was $77.7 billion and increased 18% (up 17% in constant currency)\n\n·Operating income was $38.0 billion and increased 24% (up 22% in constant currency)\n\n·Net income, on a GAAP basis, was $27.7 billion and increased 12%, and on a non-GAAP basis was $30.8 billion and increased 22% (up 21% in constant currency)\n\n·Diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, was $3.72 and increased 13%, and on a non-GAAP basis was $4.13 and increased 23% (up 21% in constant currency)\n\n·Non-GAAP results exclude the impact from investments in OpenAI, explained in the Non-GAAP Definition section below\n\n“Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,\" sa...\n\n1034.58\n\nURL: https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2025/\nTitle: Q3 earnings call: Remarks from our CEO\nDescription: Read CEO Sundar Pichai’s remarks from the Alphabet Q3 2025 earnings call.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-29T21:43:00+00:00\nContent: Oct 29, 2025\n\n7 min read\n\nIn this story\n\n*   [Introduction](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2025/#introduction)\n*   [Full-stack approach to AI](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2025/#full-stack-approach-ai)\n*   [Search](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2025/#search)\n*   [Google Cloud](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2025/#google-cloud)\n*   [YouTube](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2025/#youtube)\n*   [Waymo](https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2025/#waymo)\n\n**_Editor’s Note_**_: Our Q3 results show record growth.
