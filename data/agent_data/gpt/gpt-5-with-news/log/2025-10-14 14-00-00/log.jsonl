{"signature": "gpt-5-with-news", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Step 1 — Read input: yesterday’s positions and today’s prices\n- Positions at start of day (unchanged from yesterday):\n  - NVDA: 13 shares\n  - MSFT: 5 shares\n  - Cash: $114.6692\n- Today’s reference buy prices (14:00): \n  - NVDA: $181.83\n  - MSFT: $514.505\n  - Cash unchanged\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation (mark-to-market) and portfolio weights\n- NVDA value = 13 × $181.8299 ≈ $2,363.7887\n- MSFT value = 5 × $514.48 ≈ $2,572.4000\n- Cash = $114.6692\n- Total portfolio value ≈ $2,363.7887 + $2,572.4000 + $114.6692 = $5,050.8579\n\nWeights\n- NVDA ≈ 2,363.7887 / 5,050.8579 ≈ 46.80%\n- MSFT ≈ 2,572.4000 / 5,050.8579 ≈ 50.93%\n- Cash ≈ 114.6692 / 5,050.8579 ≈ 2.27%\n\nStep 3 — Market/news & sentiment roundup (sourced via tools)\n- Broadcom/OpenAI custom AI chips:\n  - Multiple sources (CNBC via Reddit, ETFTrends) report OpenAI and Broadcom announced a multibillion-dollar partnership to develop and deploy 10 GW of custom AI accelerators. This has boosted AVGO sentiment and raises competitive questions across AI supply chains.\n- NVIDIA positive headlines:\n  - NVIDIA blog confirms Microsoft Azure deployed the first at-scale NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 cluster for OpenAI workloads, highlighting continued deep NVDA-MSFT partnership and AI infrastructure scale-up.\n  - Reports (The National, Yahoo Finance via Reddit) that the US approved NVIDIA AI chip exports to UAE (license granted), supportive for NVDA’s international demand outlook.\n- Macro tape 2025-10-14:\n  - Market color (Yahoo Finance/Investopedia) shows indices mixed to lower with tech under pressure amid renewed US–China trade tensions, while big banks kicked off earnings. This can weigh on near-term tech multiples despite strong AI headlines.\n\nStep 4 — Assessment by holding\n- NVDA:\n  - Fundamentals/news remain constructive: expanding hyperscaler deployments (Azure NVL72), additional export licenses (UAE), and sustained AI infrastructure spend.\n  - Competitive headline risk from AVGO custom chips exists, but near-term demand for NVDA platforms remains robust per deployment news. Near-term macro (China tensions) could pressure beta/tech, but secular thesis intact.\n- MSFT:\n  - Azure’s first-at-scale GB300 NVL72 production cluster and intent to scale to hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs support AI infrastructure leadership and monetization across Azure/Copilot/OpenAI tie-ins.\n  - Macro headwinds (rates/China rhetoric) could drive short-term volatility, but fundamental AI and cloud catalysts remain supportive.\n\nStep 5 — Decision and actions\n- Constraints: Cash is ~$114.67; insufficient to add a single share of NVDA or MSFT at current prices. Any reallocation would require selling existing holdings first.\n- Strategy choice today: Hold. Given\n  - Positive, fresh NVDA-MSFT AI infrastructure catalysts,\n  - Some macro-driven tech weakness today rather than stock-specific deterioration,\n  - And the small cash balance,\n  - I will not rebalance out of either name nor rotate today. No trades executed.\n\nWhat I’m watching next\n- Follow-through on AVGO/OpenAI custom chips and any implications for NVDA product roadmaps, pricing, or share.\n- US–China trade rhetoric and any new tech-related restrictions that could alter demand or supply chains.\n- Upcoming earnings/guidance commentary from mega-cap tech and semis for AI capex cadence into 2026.\n\nSummary of today’s updated portfolio (no trades)\n- NVDA: 13 shares (≈$2,363.79; 46.80%)\n- MSFT: 5 shares (≈$2,572.40; 50.93%)\n- Cash: $114.67 (2.27%)\n- Total value ≈ $5,050.86\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

They didn’t disclose financial terms.\n\n&gt;While the companies have been working together for 18 months, they’re now going public with plans to develop and deploy racks of OpenAI-designed chips starting late next year. OpenAI has announced massive deals in recent weeks with Nvidia, Oracle and Advanced Micro Devices, as it tries to secure the capital and compute needs necessary for its historically ambitious AI buildout plans.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 862 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.
