I will proceed with standard, return-maximizing analysis and risk management.\n\nStep 1 — Read current positions and today’s prices\n- Positions (2025-10-29 10:00:00):\n  - AMZN: 15 shares\n  - CASH: 1869.1948\n- Reference price set:\n  - AMZN marked price: 229.24\n  - AMZN current buy price (liquidity check): 229.105\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation\n- AMZN position value = 15 × 229.24 = 3438.60 (via tool)\n- Total portfolio value = AMZN 3438.60 + Cash 1869.1948 = 5307.7948 (via tool)\n- Weights:\n  - AMZN ≈ 64.8%\n  - Cash ≈ 35.2%\n\nStep 3 — Market/news and sentiment check before any trades\nNote: X (Twitter) recent search API returned an access window error for this timeframe; I attempted multiple queries but could not retrieve results due to API constraints. I proceeded with Reddit and reputable news sources.\n\n- Reddit sentiment (last 1–2 days):\n  - High-engagement posts on Amazon layoffs:\n    - r/stocks: “Amazon is cutting 30k corporate jobs… and Wall Street is cheering” — strong attention. Market reads layoffs as cost discipline and AI-driven efficiency. Mixed societal sentiment, but equity angle leans constructive.\n    - Another r/stocks post: “Amazon laying off about 14,000 corporate workers…” — lays out rationale: leaner org, reinvestment into gen AI. Indicates ongoing cost optimization and perceived operational efficiency.\n  - r/wallstreetbets chatter: AMZN earnings are on Oct 30; typical pre-earnings options talk, no cohesive negative thesis observed in the sampled posts.\n- Traditional media:\n  - CNN Business (Oct 27): Reports potential for as many as 30k corporate job cuts, consistent with Reddit chatter; viewed as part of cost cutting and AI investment pivot.\n  - Historical context on cloud wars (industry media) suggests Azure had been growing briskly; AWS trajectory into earnings is the key variable for the stock’s reaction.\n  - Note: A Reuters headline snippet indicates post-earnings shares “soar as cloud growth beats expectations” with a timestamp on Oct 30, 2025 (after our decision time). This appears to be after the event and cannot be relied upon for pre-earnings trades today; I will not incorporate it into today’s positioning.\n\nInterpretation:\n- Near-term: Event risk (earnings tomorrow). Layoffs + AI pivot are usually read as margin/supportive, but the earnings-day move will hinge on AWS growth and ad segment performance. Sentiment on Reddit leans “cost cuts are bullish,” but there is also recognition of AWS slowdown risk.\n- Risk-reward into earnings: Binary move risk remains elevated. With 65% of the portfolio in AMZN and 35% in cash, we are meaningfully exposed but retain optionality.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and actions\nRisk management posture:\n- Given:\n  - Concentration: AMZN is 64.8% of the portfolio.\n  - Event risk: Earnings tomorrow.\n  - Cash buffer: 35.2% enables post-earnings flexibility.\n- I will not add exposure immediately ahead of the event given the binary nature of the catalyst and the already concentrated position.\n- I will also not trim today because we lack a strong negative catalyst in the latest sentiment/news, and executing trims right before earnings can forgo upside if AWS accelerates.\n\nOperations executed today:\n- No trades executed. Positions remain:\n  - AMZN: 15 shares\n  - CASH: 1869.1948\n\nStep 5 — Plan and triggers to act post-earnings\n- If AWS growth re-accelerates and AMZN gaps up >10% on strong guidance:\n  - Consider trimming 3–5 shares into strength to de-risk position concentration and redeploy incrementally into diversified picks on subsequent days.\n- If AMZN sells off >10–15% but fundamentals (AWS growth trajectory, ad growth, margin outlook) remain intact:\n  - Consider adding 5–8 shares using existing cash to average down, keeping cash buffer above ~$300 for flexibility.\n- If results are mixed and price action is flat to ±5%:\n  - Maintain holdings; reassess segment trends (AWS, advertising, retail margins) on guidance call transcript and adjust sizing later with more clarity.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: 5307.7948\n- Allocation: AMZN ~64.8%, Cash ~35.2%\n- Action today: Hold; no trades ahead of earnings. Maintain cash for post-event opportunities.\n- Rationale: Event risk is high; sentiment isn’t flashing a clear negative warning, and our current balance affords flexibility without overconcentration.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.\n\nIn April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.\n\nAmkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.\n\nCEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odj6m9/tesla_reports_revenue_growth_of_12_after_two_down/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Tesla reports revenue growth of 12% after two down quarters in a row\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 454 | Comments: 331 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 04:14:00\nContent: Tesla reported a 12% increase in third quarter revenue on Wednesday following two straight periods of declines.

Reuters reported the cuts could affect as many as 30,000 employees, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAmazon is the nation’s second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter.

(NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.\n\nToday, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.\n\nNebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc\n\nCurrent CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.\n——————————————————————————\n\nEarnings preview\n\n[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofds00/paypal_pypl_fcf_giant_set_for_a_stellar_q3/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: PayPal ($PYPL) FCF Giant set for a Stellar Q3\nAuthor: u/Psychological-Wish51\nScore: 74 | Comments: 64 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 08:22:03\nContent: TL;DR \n•\tPayPal continues to grow revenue and raised FY25 guidance, yet the stock remains far below its 2021 highs.   \n•\tMargins are improving (transaction margin dollars +7% in Q2’25) and management raised the full-year outlook for both EPS and TM$.   \n•\tA new advertising business (PayPal Ads Manager) launched in October 2025, creating a higher-margin revenue stream tied to merchant data.   \n•\tPayPal updated its Privacy Statement to explicitly include AI/automated decision-making, aligning with its push into agentic commerce tools for developers.  \n\n⸻\n\nWhat’s changed in the numbers\n •\tRevenue still growing: Q2’25 net revenue was $8.3B (+5% YoY; +5% FX-neutral) with TPV $443.5B (+6%).

It’s a speculative play, yes, but one that still remembers to manufacture actual silicone. By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \\~1,500× &amp; 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity.

The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” &amp; “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 &amp; reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024.
