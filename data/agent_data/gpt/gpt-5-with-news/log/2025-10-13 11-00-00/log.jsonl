Strong but with policy risk.\n- MSFT: AI/Cloud fundamentals strong medium-term; near-term pacing can be capped by capacity constraints and timing of AI monetization scaling.\n\nStep 6 — Decision and actions\n- Constraints: Available cash ($114.67) is insufficient to purchase even 1 share of the lowest-priced tracked equity, so no buys are feasible today.\n- Rebalance consideration: Given limited new incremental data and earnings still ahead later in October, risk/reward to actively rebalance right now is modest. We’ll hold current positions to keep exposure into upcoming catalysts.\n- No trades executed today.\n\nStep 7 — Risk management notes and what we’re watching next\n- NVDA: Monitor any updates on Blackwell (B100/B300) shipments, yield/supply commentary, and any incremental export policy actions. Also watch large-cap AI peer prints and hyperscaler capex updates that could affect NVDA demand signals.\n- MSFT: Watch Azure growth cadence commentary and Copilot monetization/consumption metrics into the next update window; any capacity expansion signals that could re-accelerate growth would be key.\n\nCurrent portfolio (post-update, unchanged from start of day)\n- NVDA: 13 shares\n- MSFT: 5 shares\n- Cash: $114.67\n- Total value: $5,103.45\n- Weights: MSFT 50.30%, NVDA 47.46%, Cash 2.25%\n\nNo trades executed today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\"\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-2024-10-30/\nTitle: Microsoft forecasts slower cloud business growth in second quarter\nDescription: Microsoft predicted increased spending on artificial intelligence this quarter but slower growth in its cloud business Azure, signaling that big AI investments were not enough to keep pace with capacity constraints at its data centers.\nPublish Time: 2024-10-30T20:04:06.321Z\nContent: Microsoft forecasts slower cloud business growth in second quarter | Reuters\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-2024-10-30/#main-content)\n\n[Exclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals Learn more about Refinitiv](https://www.reuters.com/differentiator/)\n\n[](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n*   [World](https://www.reuters.com/world/) \n\n[Browse World](https://www.reuters.com/world/)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n    *   [Africa](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/)\n    *   [Americas](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/)\n    *   [Asia Pacific](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/)\n    *   [China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/)\n    *   [Europe](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/)\n    *   [India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/)\n    *   [Israel and Hamas at War](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)\n    *   [Japan](https://www.reuters.c...\n\n\nURL: https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-crosses-5-trillion-valuation-remains-trade-flashpoint-2025-10-31/\nTitle: Nvidia crosses $5 trillion valuation but remains a trade flashpoint\nDescription: \nPublish Time: 2025-10-31T10:30:00Z\nContent: Nvidia crosses $5 trillion valuation but remains a trade flashpoint | Reuters\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to main content](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-crosses-5-trillion-valuation-remains-trade-flashpoint-2025-10-31/#main-content)\n\n[Exclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals Learn more about Refinitiv](https://www.reuters.com/differentiator/)\n\n[](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n*   [World](https://www.reuters.com/world/) \n\n[Browse World](https://www.reuters.com/world/)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n    *   [Africa](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/)\n    *   [Americas](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/)\n    *   [Asia Pacific](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/)\n    *   [China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/)\n    *   [Europe](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/)\n    *   [India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/)\n    *   [Israel and Hamas at War](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-ham...\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'MSFT Azure Copilot guidance 2025-10' found no results.

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*\n* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:\n   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracki\n================================================================================\n"}}
