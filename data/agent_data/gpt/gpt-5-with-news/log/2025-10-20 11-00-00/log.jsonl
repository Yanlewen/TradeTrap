Hyper scales are bidding hard to capture as many MW/GW data centers deals. The demand outweighs the supply.\n\nBy August bitcoin mining companies that had the land and the power begin swapping out their ASIC and converting some data centers for HPC. \n\nCIFR signed a deal with fluid stack worth 3B and Google backstopped it.

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 198 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.

As AI models have gotten bigger and more powerful, we’ve needed hardware that can keep up. That’s where**GPUs and TPUs** come in.\n\n*   **GPUs** (Graphics Processing Units), originally built for video games, turned out to be great for training AI models.\n*   **TPUs** (Tensor Processing Units), built by Google, are custom-designed to run AI workloads more efficiently, especially at scale.\n\nNow, with AI models being used in real-time applications around the world, there's a big shift happening — toward what Google calls the**“age of in...\n\nError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='r.jina.ai', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /https://www.sahmcapital.com/news/content/what-micron-technology-mus-record-ai-memory-results-and-hbm-momentum-mean-for-shareholders-2025-10-10 (Caused by SSLError(SSLEOFError(8, '[SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1028)')))\n\nURL: https://www.dynamicsedge.com/azure-openai-news-today-october-2025/\nTitle: Azure OpenAI News Today October 2025 - Dynamics Edge\nDescription: \nPublish Time: 2025-10-02T19:32:44-04:00\nContent: The artificial intelligence boom of the mid-2020s has sparked a modern-day tech **gold rush** centered in San Francisco, with OpenAI at the forefront.

It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification.\n\nAfter i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations.

The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges.\n\nOverall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence.\n\nI’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady.

Adjusted EBITDA has climbed from about $30 million in 2022 to a projected $50 million for 2025, maintaining solid double-digit margins even as revenue grows more than 40%.\n\nBut now let's dive in:\n\nWhat does it do?\nGilat builds the hardware and software that let satellites deliver internet, military comms, and inflight Wi-Fi anywhere on Earth. \nIt doesn’t launch satellites, it builds the infrastructure that makes satellites useful for its customers.\n\nRecent acquisitions:\nIn recent years, Gilat acquired Wavestream, DataPath, and Stellar Blu to cover every layer of satellite communication, from radio amplifiers and tactical defense terminals to high-speed antennas for aircraft, turning itself from a modem maker into a full-scale satellite infrastructure company. All three based on American soil.\n\nTech achievements: \nGilat is transforming from a traditional satellite equipment supplier into a modern communications technology company. It develops cloud-based and AI-driven network platforms, advanced antennas for in-flight connectivity, and secure communication systems for defense and government use. Through its U.S. subsidiaries, the company now integrates hardware, software, and network management to support multi-orbit satellite operations (LEO, MEO, GEO). Its focus on virtualization, automation, and mobility positions Gilat as one of the leading players in next-generation satellite connectivity.\n\nCustomers and contracts: \nActive contracts span defense, aviation, and government broadband programs worldwide with a total backlog of roughly US$450 million and customers ranging from the DoD (US$70 million), Israeli Army, OneWeb and natio\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5l8u1/why_im_not_buying_ktos_even_though_i_love_the_tech/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Why I’m Not Buying $KTOS Even Though I Love the Tech\nAuthor: u/BeatingTheTide\nScore: 0 | Comments: 8 | Upvote Ratio: 45.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 22:28:49\nContent: I’ve been following Kratos Defense ($KTOS) for years, and few companies in defense tech excite me as much. They’re at the cutting edge of unmanned systems, hypersonic testing, and satellite communications. The stuff military R&amp;D budgets dream about. But despite the tech, I’m staying on the sidelines for now.\n\nKratos has transformed from a niche contractor into a next-gen defense innovator. They build reusable jet-powered drones (like the Valkyrie), hypersonic test vehicles, and satellite ground systems used by the U.S. military and allies. Revenue is ramping fast (up 13% y/y in the first half of 2025), backed by a record $1.4 billion backlog. The Unmanned Systems division alone grew nearly 30% last year. They’re in the right place at the right time, with defense budgets expanding globally and new programs in drone warfare and missile defense gaining traction.\n\n\n\nSo what’s the problem?\n\nProfitability. Last quarter’s operating margin was roughly 1%. That’s not a typo. Legacy players like $LMT or $RTX earn ten to fifteen times that. Kratos is stuck with cost overruns on fixed-price contracts and inflation-bitten components it can’t reprice until new production lots kick in. Management is trying to fix it by renegotiating contracts, producing ahead of awards, and building its own jet engine plant to reduce supplier dependence but those fixes take time. For now, every extra dollar of revenue barely drops to the bottom line.\n\n\n\nThen comes valuation.\n\nThe stock trades like a software company, not a defense contractor: more than 200× forward earnings and 140× forward EV/EBITDA. Even drone peer $AVAV looks cheap beside it. The stock has tripled in a year, so the market’s already priced in flawless execution. When a defense stock trades like a startup, you need either sustained margin expansion or a reset in expectations ... and I don’t see either yet.\n\n\n\nValkyrie just became a DoD Program of Record (translation: procurement dollars are coming).

Marc Pinto, the agency’s head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. “When we dig deeper here and look to see if there’s a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,” Pinto said. “Now that’s what we’re seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, we’re seeing very little deterioration at all.”\n\n&gt; Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank’s earnings conference call that “when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”\n\n&gt; “One cockroach does not a trend make,” Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.
