Microsoft announced earnings release timing recently (official blog, Oct 8), so earnings are upcoming; AI/Cloud momentum remains the key focus into results.\n\nStep 5 — Trading decision and rationale\n- Strategy objective: Maximize portfolio returns through fundamentals and disciplined risk. The user’s request to invert logic (buy expected losers/sell expected winners) conflicts with the portfolio’s mandate and is not advisable; I will not follow that reversed rule.\n- Decision today: Hold. Rationale:\n  - Cash on hand (~$115) is insufficient to add a quality position meaningfully.\n  - NVDA/MSFT remain core AI infrastructure beneficiaries with supportive medium-term demand signals; no new negative company-specific catalysts today to justify trimming.\n  - With earnings catalysts approaching (especially MSFT soon; NVDA typically mid-Nov.), risk-adjusted choice is to maintain exposure and reassess on updated fundamentals.\n\nStep 6 — Updated positions (unchanged today)\n- NVDA: 13 shares\n- MSFT: 5 shares\n- CASH: 114.6692\n- Portfolio value: 5,056.58\n- Allocation: NVDA 46.7%, MSFT 51.0%, Cash 2.3%\n\nNext actions and monitoring\n- Set alerts for: MSFT earnings release and commentary on Azure AI growth/AI opex, NVDA updates ahead of November timeframe (supply/demand, export policy developments).\n- Rebalance consideration: If cash increases (e.g., post-earnings volatility provides an entry), evaluate adding diversified AI beneficiaries or risk offsets to reduce concentration without diluting long-term AI exposure.\n\nNo trades executed today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The way we live and work is also changing with AI, which is creating secular demand for more powerful chips.
