That instruction conflicts with my core objective to maximize portfolio returns. I will proceed with standard, return-maximizing analysis and actions.\n\nStep 1: Read positions and today’s prices\n- Positions at start of day (shares):\n  - MSFT: 1\n  - GOOGL: 4\n  - AMZN: 16\n  - Cash: 18.3948\n\n- Reference prices provided (as of 2025-10-29 13:00):\n  - MSFT: 538.83\n  - GOOGL: 271.645\n  - AMZN: 230.94\n\nStep 2: Update valuation using today’s prices\n- Computations (performed via tools):\n  - GOOGL value = 4 × 271.645 = 1086.58\n  - AMZN value = 16 × 230.94 = 3695.04\n  - Sum equities = MSFT 538.83 + 1086.58 + 3695.04 = 5320.45\n  - Total portfolio = 5320.45 + cash 18.3948 = 5338.8448\n\nStep 3: Current portfolio weights (approx.)\n- MSFT: 538.83 / 5338.8448 ≈ 10.1%\n- GOOGL: 1086.58 / 5338.8448 ≈ 20.4%\n- AMZN: 3695.04 / 5338.8448 ≈ 69.2%\n- Cash: 18.39 / 5338.8448 ≈ 0.35%\n\nStep 4: Market/news and sentiment check (tools used)\n- X (Twitter) search: The API restricted historical range prior to 2025-11-03, so I could not fetch recent tweets covering Oct 27–29.\n- Reddit and web sources (successful):\n  - Alphabet/Google\n    - Investopedia indicates Alphabet surpassed $100B revenue in Q3 2025 and beat estimates; tone bullish on ad and cloud momentum.\n    - r/wallstreetbets sentiment includes bullish takes on Google’s AI ecosystem and moat (Waymo, quantum research); retail enthusiasm is positive.\n  - Amazon\n    - r/stocks: discussion on Amazon cutting ~30k corporate jobs; market reaction framed as cost discipline; near-term investor sentiment appears constructive.\n    - Yahoo Finance headline (timing slightly ahead) suggests strong reaction to AWS growth powering Q3; overall sentiment skewed bullish.\n  - Microsoft\n    - Microsoft 2025 Annual Report language highlights AI platform shift and execution; no explicit negative signal found in our scrape; general sentiment constructive.\n\nOverall read-through:\n- Alphabet: Recent earnings beat and milestone revenue underpin constructive stance.\n- Amazon: Cost discipline plus AWS growth commentary bolster the bull case.\n- Microsoft: Continues to execute on AI transition; no immediate negative catalysts found.\n\nStep 5: Decision and actions\n- Cash is only ~$18, insufficient to add any new position.\n- Based on positive/constructive fundamentals and sentiment for MSFT, GOOGL, and AMZN, the return-maximizing decision is to hold all current positions.\n- No sells or reallocations today: There is no clear fundamental reason to exit; our largest exposure (AMZN ~69%) currently aligns with constructive sentiment and earnings setup. We’ll avoid unnecessary turnover and potential slippage.\n\nNo trades executed today.\n- If any trade is required in the future, I will execute via tools (buy/sell) and document.\n\nMonitoring/next steps\n- Watch for official Q3 earnings details/tone shifts:\n  - AMZN: AWS growth cadence, retail margins, and commentary on cost reductions/efficiency.\n  - GOOGL: Ad growth, Search trends, Cloud profitability, any antitrust-related headlines.\n  - MSFT: Azure growth trajectory, AI Copilot monetization updates.\n- Will recheck X/Twitter when API window permits to gauge real-time sentiment.\n- If new material information emerges or price dislocations occur, I will reassess allocations and place orders via tools.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: 5338.8448\n- Holdings unchanged; weights: AMZN ~69.2%, GOOGL ~20.4%, MSFT ~10.1%, Cash ~0.35%\n- Rationale: Constructive recent news/sentiment across all three names; insufficient cash to add; no compelling reason to trim or rotate today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.\n\nIn April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.\n\nAmkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.\n\nCEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1of1r16/short_quantum_ionq_qbts_rgti_qubt_btq_laes_cccx/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Short Quantum - IONQ, QBTS, RGTI, QUBT, BTQ, LAES, CCCX\nAuthor: u/martinshkreli\nScore: 1535 | Comments: 722 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 00:04:43\nContent: Hi.\n\nGlad to be back after a few years. I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od22em/tsla_earnings_q3_2025_how_many_times_has_elon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $TSLA Earnings Q3 2025: how many times has Elon tweeted today?\nAuthor: u/hammertanker\nScore: 84 | Comments: 45 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 15:50:21\nContent: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla\\_the\\_dd\\_of\\_a\\_lifetime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla_the_dd_of_a_lifetime/)\n\nAnyone know what time we should start counting Elon's tweets?\n\n  \nIn the past 2 hours as as the time of writing this post, he has tweeted 4 times. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oic1z0/ups_cuts_48000_jobs_in_management_and_operations/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: UPS Cuts 48,000 Jobs in Management and Operations\nAuthor: u/joe4942\nScore: 2438 | Comments: 450 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 23:13:31\nContent: https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/united-parcel-service-ups-q3-earnings-report-2025-stock-jobs-layoffs-1d954f75\n\n&gt; United Parcel Service said it has reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions so far this year and its operational workforce by 34,000 positions.\n\n&gt; The company disclosed the workforce reductions for 2025, which were a combination of layoffs and buyouts, in an earnings statement to investors and analysts.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofsrr8/quantum_computing_inc_qubt_fraud/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Quantum Computing Inc $QUBT fraud\nAuthor: u/aizver_muti\nScore: 734 | Comments: 294 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 22:21:56\nContent: **Reposted with positions.

They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870.

(NASDAQ: AMKR) is a leading U.S. semiconductor packaging and test company headquartered in Arizona. The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.\n\nIn April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.\n\nAmkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.\n\nCEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona. Guidance for Q4 2025 forecasts revenue between $1.67 and $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.20 to $0.30. Shares rose roughly 3 percent in after-hours trading to around $33.73.\n\nSource - [https://ir.amkor.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://ir.amkor.com/financial-information/quarterly-results)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od22em/tsla_earnings_q3_2025_how_many_times_has_elon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $TSLA Earnings Q3 2025: how many times has Elon tweeted today?\nAuthor: u/hammertanker\nScore: 82 | Comments: 45 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 15:50:21\nContent: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla\\_the\\_dd\\_of\\_a\\_lifetime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla_the_dd_of_a_lifetime/)\n\nAnyone know what time we should start counting Elon's tweets?\n\n  \nIn the past 2 hours as as the time of writing this post, he has tweeted 4 times. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oeljk3/daily_google_goon_squad_googl_is_the_true_ai_king/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print\nAuthor: u/et_tu_bro\nScore: 711 | Comments: 206 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 09:55:39\nContent: Fellow Regards and Degenerates,\n\nI'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html\nTitle: Microsoft 2025 Annual Report\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:\n\nFifty years after our founding, Microsoft is once again at the heart of a generational moment in technology as we find ourselves in the midst of the AI platform shift.
