No usable results.\n- Reddit sentiment and news:\n  - Alphabet tops $100B in quarterly revenue; Google Cloud +34% YoY; positive reaction (r/stocks, Oct 30).\n  - Amazon beats Q3 (Revenue $180.2B vs $177.8B est; EPS $1.95 vs $1.58; AWS $33.0B +20% YoY); positive reaction (r/stocks, Oct 31; AMZN IR release Oct 30).\n  - Microsoft: Strong Azure, guidance in line; broadly positive interpretation (Morningstar, Oct 30; Reddit discussions).\n\nInterpretation: Broadly strong fundamentals and sentiment for MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN into/after earnings, particularly cloud metrics across the “hyperscalers.”\n\nStep 3 — Update valuation and weights\n- Position values:\n  - MSFT: 2 x 525.78 = $1,051.56\n  - GOOGL: 7 x 281.48 = $1,970.36\n  - AMZN: 10 x 222.855 = $2,228.55\n  - Cash: $55.64\n- Total portfolio value: $1,051.56 + $1,970.36 + $2,228.55 + $55.64 = $5,306.11\n- Weights:\n  - AMZN: $2,228.55 / $5,306.11 ≈ 42.0%\n  - GOOGL: $1,970.36 / $5,306.11 ≈ 37.1%\n  - MSFT: $1,051.56 / $5,306.11 ≈ 19.8%\n  - Cash: $55.64 / $5,306.11 ≈ 1.05%\n\nStep 4 — Trade decision (goal: maximize long-term returns; tool-only execution)\n- Rationale: With positive news/metrics and constructive sentiment across MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN, there is no clear reason to reduce exposure today. Cash balance is minimal (~1%), so adding meaningfully is not feasible without trimming existing winners. Based on current setup, the risk/reward supports holding rather than rebalancing or trimming.\n- Note on execution prices vs. valuation: Any sell would execute at the day’s open (e.g., AMZN $248.65), not the valuation snapshot price ($222.855). Given positive news and favorable outlooks, I’m not initiating sells today.\n\nOperations executed\n- No buy/sell orders placed.\n\nCurrent updated positions (unchanged)\n- MSFT: 2\n- GOOGL: 7\n- AMZN: 10\n- CASH: $55.64\n- Portfolio value: ≈ $5,306.11\n\nNext checkpoints\n- Monitor post-earnings price action and any revisions to guidance or cloud spend commentary.\n- Reassess weights if any one position exceeds ~50% of portfolio due to a strong move, or if new information changes the outlook.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

[Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%. See, I think cloud stuff will continue to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to majorly benefit from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.\n\nDuring the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okbms0/hyperscalers_cloud_revenue_growth_msft_491b_up_26/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Hyperscalers Cloud Revenue Growth: MSFT $49.1b (up 26%), AMZN $33b (up 20%) and GOOGL $15.2b (up 34%)\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 220 | Comments: 54 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 05:02:47\nContent: The big three hyperscalers' cloud revenue growth as per the latest quarterly earnings:\n\n**MSFT**\n\nCloud Revenue = $49.1 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 26%\n\n*\"Microsoft Cloud commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392 billion.\"*\n\n**AMZN**\n\nCloud Revenue = $33 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 20%\n\n**GOOGL**\n\nCloud Revenue = $15.2 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 34%\n\n*\"Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog.\"*\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofcnus/yolong_on_amazon_earnings_amzn/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Yolo’ng on Amazon earnings $Amzn\nAuthor: u/keepBuyingApes\nScore: 198 | Comments: 59 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 07:27:58\nContent: Weird stock movement last few months while market is red hot.. i think this earning it’ll go atleast 15-20 bucks.\n\nUnless Bezos has more silicon expense coming in future i think stock is primed to rocket \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oj4mwu/nvda_is_the_first_company_to_reach_a_5_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: NVDA is the first company to reach a $5 Trillion market cap\nAuthor: u/GoZukkYourself\nScore: 2049 | Comments: 331 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 21:32:39\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/d1z6vjnnz1yf1.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b90be95c105a1684c919ed0b215a49df6a32082\n\n.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oka8ds/amzn_jumps_after_q3_earnings_and_q4_outlook_beat/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: $AMZN jumps after Q3 earnings and Q4 outlook beat estimates\nAuthor: u/Shadybite\nScore: 630 | Comments: 129 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 04:07:51\nContent: Revenue: $180.17B vs $177.8B expected  \nEPS: $1.95 vs $1.58 expected  \nAWS revenue: $33.01B vs $32.4B expected  \nQ4 revenue forecast: $206B to $213B vs $208.45B\n\n\\- Net sales increased 13% to $180.2 billion in the third quarter, compared with $158.9 billion in third quarter 2024.
