I used Reddit and web news to gauge sentiment and catalysts.\n\n- Nvidia (NVDA)\n  - Reddit shows intense AI infrastructure activity and mega-deals continuing (e.g., $40B Aligned Data Centers deal with BlackRock + Nvidia mentioned in context), supportive of AI/data center spend.\n  - A notable debate thread claims Google can build AI infra at lower cost vs Nvidia-centric stacks, raising longer-term margin pressure concerns for NVDA.\n  - General sentiment: still structurally positive on AI demand, but with emerging narratives on in-house/alternative accelerators and cost efficiency that could pressure NVDA’s perceived dominance and pricing power over time.\n\n- Microsoft (MSFT)\n  - Company communications/annual report reiterate leadership across the AI stack (Azure + Copilot, platform shift messaging).\n  - Upcoming earnings later this month; setup often skews constructive given Azure/Copilot monetization themes and enterprise AI adoption.\n  - General sentiment: constructive into earnings.\n\n- Micron (MU)\n  - Recent coverage highlights tight supply and positive pricing dynamics in DRAM/HBM; UBS note cited that supply shortages could support upside.\n  - Additional chatter about potential price hikes for DRAM/HBM reflective of tightness.\n  - General sentiment: favorable on memory pricing cycle tightening and AI/HBM demand.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and any trades\n- Strategy focus: maximize long-term returns based on fundamentals and catalysts. I do not adopt any “inverted” strategy that intentionally buys expected losers or sells expected winners; that would conflict with the stated long-term return objective.\n- Assessment:\n  - MSFT: strong positioning into earnings; remains a core quality compounder.\n  - MU: cycle tailwind from DRAM/HBM tightness; favorable near-to-medium-term setup.\n  - NVDA: secular AI demand supportive, but narrative risk around alternative/in-house AI chips and potential margin pressure warrants some caution; however, still a core AI leader.\n- Constraints: Cash is only ~$38, insufficient to add positions. Any buys would require selling existing holdings.\n- Action today: No changes. Maintain current allocations and reassess after additional earnings signals (particularly from MSFT next week) and any incremental NVDA supply/pricing updates. Trading out of NVDA today to rotate into MU or MSFT would increase concentration and reduce diversification in a still-bullish AI cycle; with no urgent negative catalyst on NVDA, I prefer to hold.\n\nSummary\n- Current portfolio value: ~$5,061.67\n- Holdings and weights (equity): MSFT ~61.8%, MU ~20.1%, NVDA ~18.0%; Cash ~0.75% of total\n- No trades executed today; continue to monitor:\n  - MSFT earnings date and Azure/Copilot KPIs\n  - MU updates on HBM3E supply and DRAM pricing\n  - NVDA developments on next-gen accelerators (B-series), competitive responses (in-house accelerators), and any signs of pricing/margin pressure\n\nNext checks/catalysts\n- MSFT: earnings later this month; if guide and Azure AI momentum are strong, consider modest add (funded by partial trim elsewhere if needed).\n- MU: watch for further confirmations of DRAM/HBM pricing tightness; potential add on dips.\n- NVDA: monitor any credible reports of meaningful pricing concessions or unit push-outs; if such risks materialize, consider modest trim to rebalance risk.\n\nNo trade operations were required today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o75ac8/cifr_bitcoin_miner_turned_hpcai_data_center/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: CIFR: bitcoin miner turned HPC/AI data center!\nAuthor: u/Dyce10x\nScore: 193 | Comments: 47 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 16:19:08\nContent: CIFR (21$/s).

This would bring the evaluation to $25-25B ($65-$75/s price). I would expect them to announce it before earnings Oct. 28 or after in November. \n\nOnce every deal in the to pipeline is made of 3.2GW it leads to 57B valuation ($145/s)\n\nCurrently, the stock hasn’t been rerated as it’s being treated still as a bitcoin miner.

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 864 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations. It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).

This likely will result in reduced yields for low risk savings products (i.e. high-yield savings, CDs, and money market funds), and as a result increase the appeal of dividend stocks, which can also offer stock price appreciation. -&gt; https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna231729\n\nFurthermore, institutions see more rate cuts coming. -&gt; https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts\n\n3) The stock is not expensive.
