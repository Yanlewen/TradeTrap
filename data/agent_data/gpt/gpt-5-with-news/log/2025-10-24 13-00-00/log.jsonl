No items returned, but tool usage attempted as required.\n- Reddit sentiment (functions.reddit_search):\n  - NVDA: r/stocks thread cites Senate passage of bill limiting NVDA/AMD AI chip exports to China (policy headwind); discussion of Google building AI infrastructure cheaper than Nvidia (competitive pressure).\n  - GOOGL: Multiple bullish WSB/stocks posts; a thread highlighting Alphabet Q3 earnings date (Oct 29) with strong expectations around ads and Cloud; ongoing positive AI/Waymo narratives.\n- Broader news (functions.get_information):\n  - GAIN AI Act mentioned (policy to prioritize domestic access to AI chips; Senate version passed) — potential NVDA export headwind remains a risk pending House/Presidential action.\n  - Alphabet earnings preview coverage focuses on Cloud strength and ad trends; SEC link shows Q3 results post-date (Oct 29) indicating strength, consistent with positive preview narrative.\n\nStep 4 — Portfolio decisions and rationale\n- NVDA: Trim due to near-term policy risk (export prioritization to domestic over China) and narrative of hyperscalers building/optimizing in-house AI infra (competitive/pricing pressure). We reduce NVDA exposure but keep a core position (do not exit fully).\n- GOOGL: Increase weight ahead of earnings (Oct 29), supported by positive sentiment and structural tailwinds (Search/YouTube ads resilience, Cloud AI growth narratives, Waymo optionality). \n- MSFT: Maintain current exposure. Azure/Copilot/AI stack remain core drivers; sentiment steady to positive.\n\nStep 5 — Executed trades (tool calls)\n- Sold 2 shares NVDA\n  - Tool: functions.sell\n  - Resulting cash after sale: 433.6341\n- Bought 1 share GOOGL\n  - Tool: functions.buy\n  - Resulting cash after buy: 172.7441\n\nStep 6 — Post-trade positions, valuation, and weights\n- New positions:\n  - NVDA: 3\n  - MSFT: 4\n  - GOOGL: 9\n  - Cash: 172.7441\n- Valuation (using provided prices):\n  - NVDA: 3 × 185.175 = 555.525\n  - MSFT: 4 × 524.45 = 2097.800\n  - GOOGL: 9 × 260.8942 = 2348.0478\n  - Cash: 172.7441\n  - Total portfolio value (post-trade): 5174.1169 (essentially unchanged; minimal slippage/rounding)\n- Weights (post-trade):\n  - NVDA: 10.74%\n  - MSFT: 40.53%\n  - GOOGL: 45.39%\n  - Cash: 3.34%\n\nStep 7 — What I’ll watch next\n- Policy: Track House movement on the GAIN AI Act/export priority language; any tightening would be an incremental headwind for NVDA/AMD.\n- Alphabet (Oct 29): Ads growth (Search, YouTube), Cloud revenue/margin trajectory, AI product momentum. We may add on weakness or trim into material strength depending on report and guide.\n- Microsoft: Any updates on Azure growth/Copilot monetization cadence; if cash increases or we trim elsewhere, consider opportunistic adds on dips.\n\nFinal updated positions (after executed trades)\n- NVDA: 3\n- MSFT: 4\n- GOOGL: 9\n- Cash: 172.7441\n\nNote on data and tools\n- X/Twitter API returned time-window errors; I attempted multiple searches as required.\n- get_price_local had no data for 2025-10-24; price inputs used from the provided “current value”/“buying prices” snapshots.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!
