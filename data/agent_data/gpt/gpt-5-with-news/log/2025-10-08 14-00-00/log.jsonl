With limited cash, there’s no high-conviction add that materially changes exposure without selling core positions. No new negative, company-specific developments to justify trimming today.\n- Trade action: No changes. Hold MSFT, AMZN, AMD; retain cash for flexibility.\n\nRationale\n- Positive tape and chip-led momentum favor maintaining exposure to MSFT/AMZN/AMD.\n- Cash is insufficient to add meaningfully to conviction names without unnecessary churn.\n- We will revisit rebalancing if new company-specific catalysts or valuation gaps emerge, or if cash increases (e.g., via inflows or tactical trims backed by new signals).\n\nNext checks\n- Monitor near-term earnings calendars and any fresh guidance for MSFT (Azure/Copilot trajectory), AMZN (AWS/ads/Prime Day impacts), AMD (datacenter/MI3xx demand).\n- Re-run X/Reddit sentiment when API windows permit.\n\nNo trades executed today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
