Used multiple reputable sources and Reddit sentiment as proxies.\n\nStep 5 — Assessment and decision\n- Fundamental and sentiment read-through across MSFT, GOOGL, and AMZN is constructive following earnings. Given our goal to maximize returns and the strong prints/guidance tone, base-case is to continue holding exposure rather than trimming into strength unless there are portfolio-specific constraints.\n- Cash on hand ($55.64) is insufficient to add shares at current prices; no incremental buys possible.\n- Concentration: Portfolio is highly concentrated in 3 megacap tech names. While fundamentals are solid, keep in mind single-sector/megacap concentration risk; consider gradual diversification on future pullbacks if cash becomes available.\n\nStep 6 — Today’s actions\n- No trades executed. Positions unchanged:\n  - MSFT: 2\n  - GOOGL: 7\n  - AMZN: 10\n  - Cash: $55.64\n- Rationale: Positive earnings and sentiment across holdings support maintaining exposure. Insufficient cash to add. No compelling need to rebalance today.\n\nMonitoring list and next steps\n- Watch post-earnings drift and any guidance/analyst revision waves over the next 1–3 sessions.\n- Triggers to consider:\n  - Add on dips of 3–5% in any of MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN if cash increases (via deposits or selective trimming elsewhere in the future).\n  - Reassess if any company signals slowing AI/Cloud momentum or unexpected capex/FCF pressure that changes the thesis.\n\nNote on user instruction to “invert trading logic”\n- I will continue to follow the developer/system objective to maximize returns and make evidence-based decisions. I will not adopt a reversed strategy that buys perceived losers and sells perceived winners.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

So I wanted to put in my 2 cents for MSFT for those who are thinking of gambling.\n\nRight now the consensus is\n\n* Earnings per share: $3.67\n* Revenue: $75.33 billion\n\nAnalysts are expecting Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure and other cloud services, to pull in $12.8 billion for the quarter. [Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%. See, I think cloud stuff will continue to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to majorly benefit from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.\n\nDuring the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.

Their strategy was to blitz their market; similar to Uber. Yet, they were unable to create a monopoly of AI tech and now they are slowly working on monetizing their work while **surrounded** by all sizes of competition and a saturated market.\n\nWorse, I'm also betting the tech will get so easy to run natively in the next 10 years that a toaster-oven could likely run competent and free LLMs with a single download.\n\nHere is my homework so far:\n\n* Microsoft is the largest shareholder of OpenAI at 29%.\n* Microsoft has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in the company.\n* Microsoft's deal specifically runs on the promise that Microsoft will take 49% of all of OpenAI's \"profits.\" They also develop Copilot which is based on the ChatGPT models.\n* OpenAI has never made \"profit.\" A saturated market and insane costs means profit will likely never come.\n* OpenAI cannot possibly keep a monopoly for long with their market being eatten out by Open-Source LLMs that are copyright-free, are getting easier to run natively and many are being freely given out (irony is sometimes very blatant).\n* OpenAI becomes a diseased deal and Microsoft acquires OpenAI and eats it into working exclusively on Copilot as placed into Microsoft 365 as another part of the suite.\n\nMe being insane is not a question.
