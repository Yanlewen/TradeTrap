It conflicts with my role to maximize returns via sound fundamental analysis. I will continue to make decisions aimed at positive expected returns.\n\nStep 1 — Read inputs (positions and prices)\n- Yesterday’s positions (today’s starting positions):\n  - MSFT: 5 shares\n  - GOOGL: 9 shares\n  - Cash: 204.1344\n- Today’s reference prices (11:00):\n  - MSFT_price: 532.72\n  - GOOGL_price: 265.75\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation\n- MSFT market value = 5 × 532.72\n- GOOGL market value = 9 × 265.75\n- Total portfolio value = MSFT value + GOOGL value + Cash\n\nCalculations\n- Using tool-calculated multiplications and sums:\n  - MSFT value = 2663.6\n  - GOOGL value = 2391.75\n  - Stock subtotal = 5055.35\n  - Total portfolio = 5055.35 + 204.1344 = 5259.4844\n\nCurrent weights (approx.)\n- MSFT: 2663.6 / 5259.48 ≈ 50.7%\n- GOOGL: 2391.75 / 5259.48 ≈ 45.5%\n- Cash: 204.13 / 5259.48 ≈ 3.9%\n\nStep 3 — Market/news and sentiment checks (tools used)\n- Macro/indices\n  - CNBC (Oct 27, 2025): S&P 500 and Nasdaq at record levels; risk-on tone and positive macro backdrop.\n- MSFT (earnings/setup)\n  - Microsoft IR site shows FY26 Q1 earnings materials page, indicating results are this week.\n- Alphabet/GOOGL (earnings/setup)\n  - Reddit r/stocks: Community posts note Alphabet Q3 earnings expected Oct 29.\n  - r/wallstreetbets sentiment around GOOGL is very bullish (numerous posts hyping AI momentum, Waymo, Cloud, etc.).\n- X (Twitter) search\n  - API time window constraints prevented fetching tweets for our time range; no usable items returned.\n\nStep 4 — Assessment\n- MSFT: Setup into earnings remains constructive with Azure strength and Copilot monetization narrative. Elevated expectations could bring volatility, but fundamentals remain solid.\n- GOOGL: Positive sentiment into Oct 29 earnings with AI, Search, YouTube, and Cloud tailwinds. As with MSFT, event risk is non-trivial but long-term risk/reward remains attractive.\n- Portfolio concentration: Highly concentrated in two mega-cap tech names heading into earnings week; modest cash buffer.\n\nStep 5 — Decision and actions for today\n- No trades today. Rationale:\n  - With only ~$204 cash, any additional buy would be marginal and not meaningfully improve expected return or diversification ahead of high-volatility events (MSFT and GOOGL earnings this week).\n  - Trimming now would reduce long-term exposure to two high-quality franchises without a strong fundamental catalyst to de-risk today.\n  - Prefer to keep small cash buffer for any post-earnings dislocations (either buy-the-dip opportunities or to add on confirmation).\n\nStep 6 — Updated portfolio snapshot (unchanged)\n- Holdings:\n  - MSFT: 5 shares (value ≈ 2663.60)\n  - GOOGL: 9 shares (value ≈ 2391.75)\n  - Cash: 204.13\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ 5259.48\n- Weights:\n  - MSFT ≈ 50.7%\n  - GOOGL ≈ 45.5%\n  - Cash ≈ 3.9%\n\nStep 7 — Next steps and monitoring plan\n- Monitor:\n  - MSFT FY26 Q1 earnings this week (Azure growth, Copilot monetization, margin mix).\n  - GOOGL Q3 earnings Oct 29 (Search/YouTube ad trends, Cloud growth and profitability, capex commentary).\n- Post-earnings plan:\n  - If either name dips on transient issues while fundamentals remain intact, consider deploying cash.\n  - If results indicate sustained acceleration with reasonable valuation, consider modestly adding on strength (subject to available cash).\n  - If results show material deterioration or negative forward guidance, consider trimming to manage concentration risk.\n\nNo trades executed today. Portfolio updated and monitored.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oe92la/intc_is_a_sleeping_dragon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon\nAuthor: u/Sensitive-Radish-292\nScore: 43 | Comments: 98 | Upvote Ratio: 70.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 01:12:05\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024\n\n# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON\n\n**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine.

In Q3 they pulled off a $9B Bitcoin transaction, which quoting Mike the founder \"brought a lot of inquiries\" ([see here](https://x.com/Vinyle_mobile/status/1979499918885552223)). In their Q2 earnings call earlier this year they also mentioned that July was there busiest ever month. Theyre streaming their earnings call on YouTube and will be hosting an AMA afterwards. I don't see them missing earnings. During earnings we should also expect on the progress of Helios. Which brings me on to my next point.\n\n**Helios AI Data Center**\n\n800 MW already leased out Coreweave, with another 2.7GW in the pipeline. Mike says that we could expect some of that capacity to be ERCOT approved by the end of the year ([see here](https://x.com/KARLW0LF/status/1978840343295496549)). There's an ERCOT meeting on the 22nd (a day after earnings) so we could hear more about this soon. Galaxy has been agressively expanding their data center operations and have recently poached some talent from top  companies ([see here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipto-mukherjee-scpm-mba-192a322a/)) and ([see here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjordan1984/)). Long term once the revenues starts coming in H1 2026 from the Coreweave deal we can expect similar jump to APLD earnings when they started\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oeljk3/daily_google_goon_squad_googl_is_the_true_ai_king/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print\nAuthor: u/et_tu_bro\nScore: 711 | Comments: 206 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 09:55:39\nContent: Fellow Regards and Degenerates,\n\nI'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://futurumgroup.com/insights/alphabet-q3-fy-2025-earnings-show-broad-based-ai-driven-growth/\nTitle: Alphabet Q3 FY 2025 Earnings Show Broad-Based AI-Driven Growth\nDescription: Alphabet Q3 FY 2025 shows AI growth in Search, YouTube, and Cloud, with higher backlog visibility and capex supporting enterprise AI demand.\nPublish Time: Sat, 08 Nov 2025 18:42:27 GMT\nContent: Alphabet Q3 FY 2025 Earnings: Broad-Based AI-Driven Growth - Futurum\n\n===============\n[Skip to content](https://futurumgroup.com/insights/alphabet-q3-fy-2025-earnings-show-broad-based-ai-driven-growth/#content)\n\n*   [Leadership Team](https://futurumgroup.com/about-us/leadership-team/) \n*   [Analyst Directory](https://futurumgroup.com/about-us/analyst-directory/) \n*   [Newsroom](https://futurumgroup.com/about-us/newsroom/) \n*   [Login](https://futurumgroup.com/insights/alphabet-q3-fy-2025-earnings-show-broad-based-ai-driven-growth/#elementor-action%3Aaction%3Dpopup%3Aopen%26settings%3DeyJpZCI6IjU4Nzc4IiwidG9nZ2xlIjpmYWxzZX0%3D) \n\n Search  \n\n[![Image 2: Futurum](https://futurumgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Logo-294x58-1.svg)](https://futurumgroup.com/)\n\n*   [Futurum Signal](https://futurumgroup.com/signal) \n*    What We Do  Close What We Do Open What We Do [![Image 4: A 60x52 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](blob:http://localhost/2c768569c6a8086d80f7537320c27825) Analyz...\n\n\nURL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/performance\nTitle: FY26 Q1 - Performance - Investor Relations - Microsoft\nDescription: FY26 Q1 - Performance - Investor Relations - Microsoft\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: FY26 Q1 - Performance - Investor Relations - Microsoft\n\n===============\n This is the Trace Id: 570f87247927495f167e0e290f329d32 \n\n![Image 1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/performance)\n\n[](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/performance)\n\n[Skip to main content](javascript:void(0))\n\n[![Image 2: A 216x46 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://uhf.microsoft.com/images/microsoft/RE1Mu3b.png)Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)\n\nInvestor Relations\n\n[Investor Relations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/default)\n\n Investor Relations \n\n*   [Home](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/default)\n*   \nInvestor Relations\n    *   [Home](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/default)\n    *   [Board & ESG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/corporate-governance/overview)\n    *   [Annual Reports](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/annual-reports)\n    *   [SEC Filings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor...\n\n\nURL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/26/stock-market-today-live-updates.html\nTitle: S&P 500 rallies 1% to notch first close ever above 6,800 on potential China trade truce: Live updates\nDescription: Stocks jumped on Monday after U.S. and China officials cooled tensions over the weekend.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-26T22:09:09+0000\nContent: Mon, Oct 27 2025 4:13 PM EDT\n\nStocks close at records\n-----------------------\n\nAll the three major averages finished at record levels on Monday.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.23% to end at 6,875.16.
