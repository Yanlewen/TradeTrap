Attempted but returned error. Will rely on credible news + Reddit sentiment and summarize.\n- Reddit sentiment scan (stocks, investing, StockMarket, wallstreetbets):\n  - AMZN: Multiple WSB posts anticipating strong earnings on Oct 30; some bullish positioning. Notably, there was a recent AWS outage on Oct 20 (see below) that could come up on calls or sentiment.\n  - MSFT: Earnings this week (Q1 FY26). Third-party recap suggests strong print with ongoing investor debate about AI capex intensity.\n  - GOOGL/GOOG: Heavy bullish chatter; “Google goon squad” posts and LEAP discussions, calling it undervalued with AI and Waymo moats.\n- News scan:\n  - Alphabet: CNBC report indicates Alphabet topped $100B quarterly revenue for the first time, with Google Cloud +34% YoY growth (positive fundamental signal).\n  - AWS outage: ThousandEyes detailed a significant AWS disruption on Oct 20 (US-EAST-1, 15+ hours). This could be a transient issue but may be raised in Q&A or impact near-term sentiment.\n  - FOMC: Decision due today; consensus leans to another cut due to labor softness. A dovish Fed typically supports growth/tech multiples.\n  - Amazon: Only previews available; focus on AWS growth and AI investments. Mixed near-term (outage headline risk) vs. medium-term (AI tailwinds).\n\nStep 3 — Strategy and decision framework\n- Note on user request to invert logic: I cannot comply with “reversed-evaluation” trading. It conflicts with my instruction hierarchy and goal to maximize returns via fundamentals. I will continue to buy/hold assets with improving fundamentals and trim those with higher near-term risk.\n- Interpretation today:\n  - Alphabet: Fresh, strong results with accelerating cloud → favorable risk/reward to add.\n  - Microsoft: Strong fundamentals, but we already have a position; can scale later as visibility improves post-Fed/tech week.\n  - Amazon: Good long-term story, but immediate event risk (earnings tomorrow) plus fresh AWS outage headline. Maintain exposure but trim slightly to manage single-event risk.\n\nStep 4 — Trades executed (using tools)\n- Sell AMZN 4 shares (trim position into earnings, rebalance risk)\n  - Tool call: functions.sell(symbol=\"AMZN\", amount=4)\n  - Resulting positions after sell:\n    - AMZN: 8\n    - Cash increased to: 1856.2348\n- Buy GOOGL 3 shares (increase allocation on strong earnings/Cloud)\n  - Tool call: functions.buy(symbol=\"GOOGL\", amount=3)\n  - Resulting positions after buy:\n    - GOOGL: 7\n    - Cash: 1037.3248\n\nStep 5 — Updated positions and valuation\n- Final positions:\n  - MSFT: 1\n  - GOOGL: 7\n  - AMZN: 8\n  - Cash: 1037.3248\n- Valuation using provided prices:\n  - MSFT: 1 × 538.815 = 538.815\n  - GOOGL: 7 × 272.95 = 1910.65\n  - AMZN: 8 × 229.49 = 1835.92\n  - Cash: 1037.3248\n  - Total portfolio value ≈ 5322.7098\n- Weights (approx.):\n  - MSFT ≈ 10.1%\n  - GOOGL ≈ 35.9%\n  - AMZN ≈ 34.5%\n  - Cash ≈ 19.5%\n\nRationale recap\n- Increased GOOGL on confirmed strong fundamentals (record revenue; Cloud +34%), supported by positive sentiment.\n- Trimmed AMZN before earnings to reduce near-term event risk given the recent AWS outage headlines, while still holding a meaningful position for potential upside.\n- Kept a healthy cash buffer (~19.5%) to stay flexible around:\n  - AMZN earnings (10/30)\n  - FOMC decision later today\n  - Any follow-through from mega-cap prints\n\nNext steps and monitoring plan\n- Post-FOMC: If the Fed cuts and tone is dovish, consider deploying more cash into MSFT/GOOGL on any constructive dips.\n- AMZN earnings: Reassess AWS growth, margin trajectory, and commentary addressing the recent outage. If fundamentals remain strong and guidance is solid, consider re-adding to AMZN on clarity.\n- Continue to scan X and Reddit for any emerging sentiment shifts and news (especially AWS customer feedback, ad-spend trends for GOOGL, and Azure growth for MSFT).\n\nOperations log (tools used)\n- Sentiment/news: functions.reddit_search, functions.get_information, attempted functions.x_search (time window restricted)\n- Trades:\n  - functions.sell(AMZN, 4)\n  - functions.buy(GOOGL, 3)\n\nCurrent portfolio (post-trade)\n- MSFT: 1\n- GOOGL: 7\n- AMZN: 8\n- Cash: 1037.3248\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

(NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.\n\nToday, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.\n\nNebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc\n\nCurrent CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.\n——————————————————————————\n\nEarnings preview\n\n[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ocjy46/amzn_earnings_on_the_30th/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AMZN - Earnings on the 30th\nAuthor: u/PaperHandsTheDip\nScore: 84 | Comments: 96 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 01:56:10\nContent: Buying these now as it's on my radar and I'll forget to buy before ER's.

Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock. They currently have 110M Daily Active Users (DAU) and have a long-term vision of 1B people playing Roblox.\n\nDespite the surge in stock price, the flaws that Hindenburg pointed out are still in place, future growth is uncertain, and the path to profitability seems very unlikely.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1o4sjzh/week_recap_trump_warned_of_new_massive_tariffs_on/\nSubreddit: r/StockMarket\nTitle: Week Recap: Trump warned of new \"massive\" tariffs on China.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oey7y3/weekly_earnings_thread_1027_1031/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/27 - 10/31\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 448 | Comments: 3741 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 21:47:41\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o30q4w/weekly_earnings_thread_1013_1017/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/13 - 10/17\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 195 | Comments: 970 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 21:20:15\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ogs58b/path_is_about_to_rip_20/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $PATH is about to rip 20%\nAuthor: u/spacedaddybranson\nScore: 394 | Comments: 236 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 02:33:07\nContent: **$PATH** has given a 20% pullback since Trump Tweet on Oct 10th, but has sharply bounced of $15 and has now confirmed a bullish reversal signal with next price target of $20.
