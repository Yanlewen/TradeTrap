Azure +40% Y/Y (CNBC). Strong cloud/AI momentum.\n- Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG)\n  - Q3 2025: Revenue ~$102.35B vs $99.89B est; YouTube ads beat; Google Cloud +34% Y/Y. Broad beat, positive commentary (Reddit link summarizing CNBC).\n- Amazon (AMZN)\n  - Signals of strength into/around Q3: SeekingAlpha headline and CNBC report indicate beat with AWS acceleration (~20% Y/Y) and strong Ads; shares reportedly spiked post-report. Note: Our current timestamp is 14:00 ET; if results land after close, near-term move risk/reward remains, but setup looks constructive.\n\n- X/Twitter API\n  - Recent search API returned an invalid time-window error; couldn’t pull posts within our exact timeframe due to API constraints.\n- Reddit\n  - Threads/coverage broadly upbeat for mega-cap tech; GOOGL praised; general risk-on chatter in earnings week threads.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and rationale\n- We currently have minimal cash ($55), and our three holdings (MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN) all have strong, improving fundamentals and positive sentiment.\n- MSFT: Just delivered a strong beat with robust Azure growth; favorable to hold.\n- GOOGL: Beat across key lines; Cloud growth re-accelerating; favorable to hold.\n- AMZN: Ahead of/around earnings, signals point to AWS re-acceleration and overall strength; risk of volatility around print, but expected risk/reward is favorable; holding makes sense.\n\nTrades today (14:00 ET): No changes\n- Reasons:\n  - All three positions exhibit strong momentum/fundamental support post-MSFT/GOOGL reports and into AMZN earnings.\n  - No compelling reason to rotate given limited cash; forced trimming could reduce exposure to leaders with positive catalysts.\n  - Maintain positioning through potential AMZN catalyst later today.\n\nStep 5 — Monitoring plan and risk controls\n- Watch AMZN into earnings and after-hours reaction:\n  - If large upside move materializes and valuation stretches, consider modest trim to rebalance risk and redeploy into cash or selectively into MSFT/GOOGL on dips.\n- Keep an eye on:\n  - Fed speakers and rate path expectations; further hawkish pushback could pressure multiples.\n  - GOOGL TAC trends and regulatory headlines.\n  - MSFT Copilot adoption commentary and Azure trajectory.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value ≈ $5,350.20\n- Weights: AMZN 42.1%, GOOGL 37.2%, MSFT 19.7%, Cash 1.0%\n- Action: Hold all.

Chipotle’s customer base skews higher income, so it was insulated from the pullback in spending from low-income consumers that fast-food chains were reporting last year.\n\nHere’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 29 cents adjusted, in line with expectations\n* **Revenue:** $3 billion vs. $3.03 billion expected\n\nChipotle reported third-quarter net income of $382.1 million, or 29 cents per share, down from $387.4 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding slight adjustments for stock-based compensation grants and other items, the burrito chain still earned 29 cents per share. \n\nNet sales rose 7.5% to $3 billion, fueled by new restaurants. The company opened 84 company-operated locations and two licensed international stores.\n\nChipotle’s same-store sales increased 0.3% in a reversal from last quarter’s decline. But the growth in sales at restaurants open at least a year came from a 1.1% bump in average check, as traffic dipped.\n\nTo revive traffic growth, Chipotle is focusing on its in-restaurant execution, marketing, digital experience and menu innovation, according to Boatwright.\n\nLooking to 2026, Chipotle anticipates that it will open 350 to 370 new l\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oeljk3/daily_google_goon_squad_googl_is_the_true_ai_king/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print\nAuthor: u/et_tu_bro\nScore: 709 | Comments: 206 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 09:55:39\nContent: Fellow Regards and Degenerates,\n\nI'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century. Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ogs58b/path_is_about_to_rip_20/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $PATH is about to rip 20%\nAuthor: u/spacedaddybranson\nScore: 388 | Comments: 236 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 02:33:07\nContent: **$PATH** has given a 20% pullback since Trump Tweet on Oct 10th, but has sharply bounced of $15 and has now confirmed a bullish reversal signal with next price target of $20. RSI successfully holding above 50, with mega-cap AI earnings this week, $PATH is about to rip 20%, all in $20c.\n\nThis is where $PATH gets sexy.\n\n* **Partnerships Galore**: Fresh ties with NVIDIA (for GPU-accelerated agents), OpenAI (LLM integration), Google Gemini (voice workflows), and Snowflake Cortex (data orchestration). This week alone, they announced deeper AI alliances that could juice enterprise adoption. Imagine: UiPath bots pulling real-time data from Snowflake, reasoning with OpenAI, and deploying on NVIDIA hardware. That's not incremental; that's a moat.\n* **Product Momentum**: Agentic platform's getting rave reviews—enterprises are piloting it for complex shit like supply chain orchestration. Motley Fool just dropped \"4 Major Trends Powering UiPath's Next Growth Phase,\" citing AI adoption, vertical expansions (healthcare, finance), and global push.\n* **Market Tailwinds**: RPA market's $25B today, projected $65B by 2030 (CAGR 20%+). But agentic AI? That's the $100B+ unlock. UiPath's positioned as the \"Salesforce of automation.\" Next earnings in December could be the spark—expect AI pipeline updates to light Twitter on fire.\n\nSentiment's flipping too. X chatter's buzzing with \"generational run\" calls and $20C options flow. One trader's eyeing the 200-week MA break for \"multiples.\" Even with some promo noise, the vibe's bullish.\n\n**Valuation: Undervalued AF Compared to AI Peers**\n\nAnalysts are sleeping—consensus PT's a meh $13.71 (Hold rating), high of $17.

I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.

(NASDAQ: AMKR) is a leading U.S. semiconductor packaging and test company headquartered in Arizona. The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.\n\nIn April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.\n\nAmkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.\n\nCEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona. Guidance for Q4 2025 forecasts revenue between $1.67 and $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.20 to $0.30. Shares rose roughly 3 percent in after-hours trading to around $33.73.\n\nSource - [https://ir.amkor.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://ir.amkor.com/financial-information/quarterly-results)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oajzdq/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Daily General Discussion and Advice Thread - October 19, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 9 | Comments: 38 | Upvote Ratio: 81.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 16:00:57\nContent: Have a general question?
