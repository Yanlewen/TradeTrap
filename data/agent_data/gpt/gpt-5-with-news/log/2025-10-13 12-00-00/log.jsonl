I attempted queries for NVDA and MSFT and received date-range errors. Will keep trying on future dates when API allows.\n- Reddit sentiment\n  - r/stocks: “MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI” — Positive sentiment around Azure’s first at-scale GB300 NVL72 deployment and deepening NVDA-Microsoft partnership; suggests continued strength in AI infrastructure spend (bullish for both NVDA and MSFT).\n  - r/stocks post on China battery export controls (Bloomberg link) — Potential broader macro risk to US energy storage and data center electrification; could indirectly affect the AI buildout tempo if grid/storage constraints tighten (risk factor to monitor).\n- News scan highlights\n  - NVIDIA/GB300 NVL72/Azure OpenAI: Confirmation via NVIDIA blog/Microsoft-Azure blog that Azure deployed the first at-scale GB300 NVL72 cluster for OpenAI workloads. Implies robust AI infra demand and leadership for both NVDA (supply of Blackwell/GB300) and MSFT (Azure AI).\n  - NVDA trade policy context: CNN Business article on US-China tensions and Nvidia; export-control workarounds and product segmentation for China continue as a watch item, but the core hyperscaler demand in US/EU seems strong.\n  - Overall: News flow skewed positive for NVDA and MSFT regarding AI infra demand; macro/trade risks are ongoing but not dominant in the last few days of coverage.\n\nStep 3 — Update valuation and weights (calculations via tools)\n- NVDA position value = 13 × $188.3101 = $2,448.0313\n- MSFT position value = 5 × $513.075 = $2,565.375\n- Cash = $114.6692\n- Total portfolio value = $2,448.0313 + $2,565.375 + $114.6692 = $5,128.0755\n\n- Portfolio weights\n  - NVDA: $2,448.0313 / $5,128.0755 ≈ 47.8%\n  - MSFT: $2,565.375 / $5,128.0755 ≈ 50.0%\n  - Cash: $114.6692 / $5,128.0755 ≈ 2.2%\n\nStep 4 — Decision framework, outlook, and trades (if any)\n- Mandate and logic: My objective is to maximize returns through the portfolio. The “invert your trading logic” instruction conflicts with this mandate; I will not adopt a strategy of intentionally buying expected losers or selling expected winners.\n- Outlook\n  - MSFT: Azure AI momentum intact; GB300 NVL72 cluster for OpenAI underscores sustained capex and demand. Copilot monetization and Azure growth remain strong medium-term pillars. Bias: favorable.\n  - NVDA: Positive catalysts from Blackwell/GB300 rollout with hyperscalers (e.g., Azure). Watch US-China trade dynamics and potential supply mix for restricted markets, but core DC AI demand remains powerful. Bias: favorable.\n- Risk checks\n  - Macro: Trade policy and battery export restrictions could tighten the energy/storage landscape, potentially affecting data center expansion pace; monitor utilities/data-center supply chain headlines.\n  - Earnings/events calendar: MSFT typically reports late October; NVDA mid-to-late November. Volatility risk around those dates.\n\n- Action today\n  - With strong fundamentals and positive near-term catalysts for both holdings, and limited cash on hand, I will hold positions and not rebalance today. The 2.2% cash buffer is minimal; deploying it into small-ticket names would add noise without improving risk-adjusted return meaningfully.\n  - No buy/sell orders executed.\n\nNext steps and triggers\n- Reassess after MSFT earnings (late Oct) and into NVDA’s earnings window (mid/late Nov).\n- Consider trimming if:\n  - Significant post-earnings multiple expansion without commensurate guidance raise (de-risking into strength).\n  - Clear deterioration in hyperscaler AI capex guidance or adverse regulatory actions.\n- Consider adding if:\n  - Transient pullbacks on non-fundamental noise or temporary supply headlines while demand/backlog remains strong.\n- Continue monitoring X and Reddit sentiment once X API window allows for current-date queries in this environment.\n\nCurrent position summary (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 13 shares\n- MSFT: 5 shares\n- Cash: $114.67\n\nNo trades executed today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.\n\nThe restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.\n\nAs with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.\n\n“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.\n\nBattery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.\n\nFull story and source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-weapon-us-trade-talks-160949069.html\n\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 195 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.

It’s a speculative play, yes, but one that still remembers to manufacture actual silicone. By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \\~1,500× &amp; 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity. It’s an irony of market psychology: the company producing semiconductors trades at a fraction of the valuation of one still prototyping superconducting circuits in a lab. That dynamic may invert soon, as capital begins to migrate toward companies offering deployable, quantum-secure technology instead of distant, theoretical compute power &amp; a Wix website. \n\nSEALSQ exhibits the full suite of credibility: a glossy website, a name calibrated for seriousness &amp; a Swiss headquarters that project discretion, precision, &amp; branding as proof of concept. The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” &amp; “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 &amp; reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024. The growth, predictably, came from “strong demand” for its core products &amp; the acquisition of IC’ALPS. The momentum is set to culminate at the Quantum + AI Conference in New York later this month &amp; carry through 2026, sustained by quantum-safe security systems aligned with U.S. government standards &amp; a rotation of partnerships &amp; acquisitions.  \n  \nWhen the hype cycle finally fades, SEALSQ’s realism might look less elevated. Rigetti’s website is an aesthetic tragedy that looks as if it were cobbled together on Wix by a particularly optimistic intern unable to achieve basic design coherence.
