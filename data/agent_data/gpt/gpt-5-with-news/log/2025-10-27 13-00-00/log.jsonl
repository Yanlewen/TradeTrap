Cloud/AI tailwinds and continued Azure strength are the key focal points (source: Microsoft IR portal).\n- Alphabet (GOOGL)\n  - Alphabet’s Q3 2025 earnings are scheduled for 10/29 (per investor chatter and calendar posts). Market focus on Search ad trends and Google Cloud margins.\n  - Fresh positive developments:\n    - Major Google Cloud–Anthropic expansion: access to up to 1 million TPUs by 2026; framed as a large, high-margin cloud contract and strong validation of TPU stack (source: Reddit link to Yahoo Finance).\n    - Community sentiment skewing positive into earnings (multiple Reddit posts discussing value vs. peers, AI infra cost competitiveness).\n- Social sentiment sampling\n  - Reddit: Generally bullish commentary around GOOGL’s AI moat, Cloud profitability path, and upcoming earnings; also bullish macro tone for mega-cap tech.\n  - X/Twitter: API access window prevented retrieval for the specified dates in our environment today; no usable data returned.\n\nStep 5 — Assessment and plan\n- Concentration: Portfolio is ~96.1% invested across two mega-cap tech names with earnings in ~2 days, with minimal cash.\n- Thesis check:\n  - MSFT: Strong execution, durable AI/cloud momentum, favorable fundamental backdrop.\n  - GOOGL: Positive AI-cloud catalysts (Anthropic deal), broad optimism into earnings, perceived attractive valuation among mega-caps.\n- Risk considerations:\n  - Event risk from both companies reporting this week (post-close 10/29). With limited cash, there’s little flexibility to opportunistically add on volatility.\n  - However, both positions have strong medium-term fundamentals.\n\nStep 6 — Trade decision (today)\n- Action: No trades today.\n  - Rationale: \n    - Cash on hand ($204) is insufficient to buy even one share of our core holdings without selling something.\n    - Pre-earnings, both positions have favorable fundamental and sentiment setups; forced trimming to free cash reduces exposure ahead of potentially strong prints.\n    - Maintain positioning and reassess immediately after earnings or on any pre-earnings dislocations.\n\nWhat I’ll monitor next\n- 10/29 after-hours earnings for MSFT and Alphabet:\n  - MSFT: Azure growth trajectory, AI services monetization, Copilot attach/usage, Commercial bookings.\n  - GOOGL: Ad revenue growth (Search/YouTube), Cloud margins and backlog, AI infra commentary (TPUs, Anthropic deal contribution path).\n- If either stock gaps materially post-earnings, we’ll consider rebalancing for risk/return optimization.\n\nCurrent positions after today’s review (no change executed)\n- MSFT: 5 shares\n- GOOGL: 9 shares\n- Cash: $204.13\n- Total value: ~$5,264.16\n- Weights: MSFT 50.5%, GOOGL 45.7%, Cash 3.9%\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o30q4w/weekly_earnings_thread_1013_1017/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/13 - 10/17\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 197 | Comments: 970 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 21:20:15\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3uusq/google_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google earnings\nAuthor: u/Ben280301\nScore: 321 | Comments: 86 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:51:51\nContent: Google is announcing their Q3 earnings on October 29.\n\nTheir revenue is expected to be between $94 billion and $100 billion, while EPS is expected between $2,30 and $2,32.\n\nTheir revenue grew 13% from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 while EPS grew 22%.\n\nThey are the only MAG7 stock that is even close to being a value investment and most of this sub holds it, I own both shares and Jan 16 ‘26 205$ calls bought in July.\n\nThis is the first ER after antitrust decision which pushed the stock down for a while.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oe92la/intc_is_a_sleeping_dragon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon\nAuthor: u/Sensitive-Radish-292\nScore: 46 | Comments: 98 | Upvote Ratio: 71.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 01:12:05\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024\n\n# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON\n\n**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine.

Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,..

I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat.

Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oey7y3/weekly_earnings_thread_1027_1031/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/27 - 10/31\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 449 | Comments: 3741 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 21:47:41\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1of1r16/short_quantum_ionq_qbts_rgti_qubt_btq_laes_cccx/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Short Quantum - IONQ, QBTS, RGTI, QUBT, BTQ, LAES, CCCX\nAuthor: u/martinshkreli\nScore: 1537 | Comments: 722 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 00:04:43\nContent: Hi.\n\nGlad to be back after a few years. I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 858 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

Finally, we will review any contracts and future prospects.\n\n**1)** **Fundamentals.** The market cap of QUBT is $3.73 billion and for the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, QUBT reported revenues of $61,000 (yes, you read that right), a decrease from the $183,000 generated in the same quarter of the previous year. They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870. To put it into perspective how extreme that is: \n\n\nCompany | Enterprise Value/Revenue\n-------|------------------------\nQUBT | 12870\nIONQ | 419\nGOOGL | 8\nRDDT | 20\n\nIf you think RDDT is inflated, then QUBT is roughly 643 more inflated.\nEquivalently, RDDT's price would be $137,602 with QUBT's ratio.\nThis isn't just a premium or hopeium, this is complete detachment from any financial logic or reality.\n\nThe company's operational model is a financial black hole.
