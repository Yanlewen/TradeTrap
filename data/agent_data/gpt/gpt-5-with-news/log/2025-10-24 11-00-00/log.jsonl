But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.\n\nThe restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.\n\nAs with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.\n\n“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.\n\nBattery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.\n\nFull story and source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-weapon-us-trade-talks-160949069.html\n\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1obfgkw/rddt_earnings_dd/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: RDDT Earnings DD\nAuthor: u/slocs1\nScore: 134 | Comments: 78 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-20 17:28:57\nContent: Hi all, I think RDDT will have great earnings.\n\nRDDT was beaten down from 280 to 190 by shorts in the last weeks and as there were no news at all they won.

Well, I’m finally capitulating and degened into a pre-revenue stock that I spent researching for less than 3 hours; it’s called Terrestrial Energy (HOND). Think of it as OKLO, but with way lower market cap and needs way less money to get it going.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nThe play is riding momentum on a company that burns less cash and sits at a significantly lower valuation than OKLO. Less to lose, more to gain. If you want to keep reading to feel less like a regard, carry on.\n\n•Terrestrial Energy (TE): Doesn't build the nuclear plant; Vendor/licensing model keeps capex low and is relatively low-risk due to its &lt;1B market cap. Uses standard LEU fuel. Regulatory progress is solid (Nuclear Regulation Commision + Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission milestones), validating their tech and design .SPAC merger coming like its 2021, $280M cash in hand. Won't have plants online until early 2030s. \n\n•Oklo Inc.: Uses HALEU fuel, which is hard to acquire. Builds and operates their own plants = massive capex costs, but has potential to make more income. Valuation is insane baffling. Timeline is aggressive (\\~2027–28 first deployment).\n\n**Fundamental Technicals: Jargon that I don’t understand**\n\n**TE**: IMSR Molten Salt Reactor\n\nTE uses IMSR is basically the lovechild of Oak Ridge lab research and “how do I make this cheap and simple” engineering. Their tech uses molten salt coolant which allows for high temperature (\\~400°C+) at low pressure, which means you don’t need the huge, expensive containment vessels that normal nuclear plants do. Their design has a huge bump in efficiency: about 50% better than conventional LWR plants. Their plant will be large enough to replace grid \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o75ac8/cifr_bitcoin_miner_turned_hpcai_data_center/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: CIFR: bitcoin miner turned HPC/AI data center!\nAuthor: u/Dyce10x\nScore: 188 | Comments: 47 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 16:19:08\nContent: CIFR (21$/s).

Hyper scales are bidding hard to capture as many MW/GW data centers deals. The demand outweighs the supply.\n\nBy August bitcoin mining companies that had the land and the power begin swapping out their ASIC and converting some data centers for HPC. \n\nCIFR signed a deal with fluid stack worth 3B and Google backstopped it. Completely derisked and sitting on 1.3B of capital with 0% interest. \n\nGrowth &amp; Upcoming Catalyst \nThe next deal is expected to be made by EOY per the CEO for 300MW site. This would bring the evaluation to $25-25B ($65-$75/s price). I would expect them to announce it before earnings Oct. 28 or after in November. \n\nOnce every deal in the to pipeline is made of 3.2GW it leads to 57B valuation ($145/s)\n\nCurrently, the stock hasn’t been rerated as it’s being treated still as a bitcoin miner. Rerating is on the horizon after the 300MW deal which could be soon. \n\nIf you want daily chatter and deep-dive understanding I would recommend following Mike Alfred &amp; Eric Jackson on X. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oeljk3/daily_google_goon_squad_googl_is_the_true_ai_king/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Daily GOOGLE GOON SQUAD: $GOOGL$ is the true AI king and it’s about to print\nAuthor: u/et_tu_bro\nScore: 707 | Comments: 206 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 09:55:39\nContent: Fellow Regards and Degenerates,\n\nI'm here to tell you that $GOOGL / $GOOG is the most criminally undervalued stock in mega-cap tech because it’s the undisputed leader in the technologies that define the next century.
