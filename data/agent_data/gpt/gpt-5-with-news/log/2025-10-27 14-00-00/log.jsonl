It conflicts with my higher-priority objective to maximize returns through this portfolio. I will continue to follow the developer/system instructions: gather information using search tools and make trades aimed at maximizing returns.\n\nStep 1 — Read current positions and today’s prices (2025-10-27 14:00:00):\n- Positions provided:\n  - MSFT: 5 shares\n  - GOOGL: 9 shares\n  - Cash: 204.1344\n  - All other tickers: 0\n- Today’s prices used for valuation:\n  - MSFT_price: 531.885\n  - GOOGL_price: 268.18\n  - Cash unchanged\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation:\n- MSFT market value = 5 × 531.885 = 2,659.425\n- GOOGL market value = 9 × 268.18 = 2,413.62\n- Cash = 204.1344\n- Total portfolio value = 2,659.425 + 2,413.62 + 204.1344 = 5,277.1794\n\nStep 3 — Portfolio weights (based on updated valuation):\n- MSFT: 2,659.425 / 5,277.1794 = 50.37%\n- GOOGL: 2,413.62 / 5,277.1794 = 45.74%\n- Cash: 204.1344 / 5,277.1794 = 3.87%\n\nStep 4 — Market/news and sentiment check before any trades:\n- Objective: Assess near-term catalysts for MSFT and Alphabet (GOOGL) ahead of earnings this week.\n\nTools used:\n- Web search:\n  - Microsoft FY26 Q1 press release indicates strong cloud and AI momentum; earnings date and details align with Q3 CY25 (reported Oct 29, 2025).\n  - Alphabet IR confirms Q3 2025 earnings call date on Oct 29, 2025.\n  - Third-party preview (IG) emphasizes focus on Google Cloud and ad revenue trends for Alphabet.\n- Reddit sentiment:\n  - Multiple WSB and r/stocks posts are actively discussing Alphabet with generally bullish tone going into Oct 29 earnings.\n  - Community threads show engagement and optimism for GOOGL/GOOG.\n- X (Twitter) API:\n  - Attempted recent search, but API tool only supports start_time after 2025-11-03; could not retrieve current window. This limitation is noted; alternative sentiment gathered via Reddit and IR pages.\n\nStep 5 — Assessment and trade decision:\n- Both MSFT and Alphabet report Oct 29, implying elevated event risk and volatility. Sentiment and IR cues skew positive:\n  - Microsoft: Strong trends in cloud/AI; recent results (to be reported Oct 29) historically have been supportive of the bull case.\n  - Alphabet: Market focus on Search/YouTube/Cloud; community sentiment on Reddit is bullish heading into earnings.\n- Current cash on hand is small ($204). Adding a tiny new position (e.g., low-priced stocks) would not be thesis-aligned and would dilute focus without meaningful impact.\n- Given the positive skew and limited cash, best course: hold current positions, avoid unnecessary rotation, and keep cash buffer.\n\nOperations executed:\n- No buy/sell operations executed today. (Note: Any trade would be placed using the buy/sell tools; none were warranted after analysis.)\n\nSummary:\n- Updated portfolio value: 5,277.1794\n- Weights: MSFT 50.37%, GOOGL 45.74%, Cash 3.87%\n- Action: Hold MSFT and GOOGL into earnings; keep cash reserve. Continue monitoring pre-earnings commentary and any last-minute developments.\n\nNext checkpoints:\n- Reassess on 2025-10-28 and pre-close on 2025-10-29 for any adjustment before earnings prints.\n- Post-earnings: evaluate results and guidance promptly to decide on scaling exposure.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o30q4w/weekly_earnings_thread_1013_1017/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/13 - 10/17\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 194 | Comments: 970 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 21:20:15\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3uusq/google_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google earnings\nAuthor: u/Ben280301\nScore: 318 | Comments: 86 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:51:51\nContent: Google is announcing their Q3 earnings on October 29.\n\nTheir revenue is expected to be between $94 billion and $100 billion, while EPS is expected between $2,30 and $2,32.\n\nTheir revenue grew 13% from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 while EPS grew 22%.\n\nThey are the only MAG7 stock that is even close to being a value investment and most of this sub holds it, I own both shares and Jan 16 ‘26 205$ calls bought in July.\n\nThis is the first ER after antitrust decision which pushed the stock down for a while.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o70lkk/us_market_cap_from_27trillion_in_2015_to/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: US Market cap from 27Trillion in 2015 to 69+Trillion in 2025.

The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oey7y3/weekly_earnings_thread_1027_1031/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/27 - 10/31\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 442 | Comments: 3741 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 21:47:41\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact!\n\nBut now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well!\n\nI noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. \n\nBelow, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31.\n\nEnd of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53\n\nTrendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.\n\nNow lets look at fUnDamENtalS\n\n**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally.

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1of8d86/goog_leap_mafia_where_you_at/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: GOOG LEAP Mafia where you at?\nAuthor: u/trentcoolyak\nScore: 590 | Comments: 147 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 04:21:50\nContent: Post your screenshots below👇\n\nOk but FR fellow regards, do we hedge OTM leaps during earnings?
