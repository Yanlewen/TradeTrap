Noted limitation.\n- Web/news search highlights:\n  - NVDA: Positive commentary on long-term AI/data center demand and dominance; bullish article profiling continued strength.\n  - AMD: Reports indicating strong MI300/Instinct GPU traction with multi-billion revenue ramp; competitive AI accelerator demand.\n  - MSFT: Annual report and partner updates emphasize continued AI platform shift, Copilot adoption, and Azure strength.\n  - AMZN: Prime/retail momentum; AWS remains core growth engine though no new specific October datapoint surfaced in this pass.\n\nSynthesis:\n- Semiconductors/AI infra (NVDA, AMD) show continued strong demand signals.\n- MSFT remains a diversified AI beneficiary with durable fundamentals.\n- AMZN steady with AWS and retail; no negative catalysts surfaced in this pass.\n\nStep 5: Actionable decision today\n- Constraints: Cash on hand ($134.48) is insufficient to add a single share to current holdings (all are >$180+ per share).\n- Rotation consideration: No compelling reason to reduce any of NVDA/MSFT/AMZN/AMD based on today’s signals; fundamentals and sentiment skew positive.\n- Decision: Hold existing positions; no trades executed today. Maintain small cash buffer.\n\nNotes and next steps\n- Will continue to monitor:\n  - NVDA/AMD: AI accelerator demand, supply dynamics, large cloud orders, earnings/date guidance updates.\n  - MSFT: Azure growth rates, Copilot monetization metrics.\n  - AMZN: AWS growth trends, retail margin trajectory.\n- If near-term weakness provides favorable entries, prioritize adding AMD and NVDA, then MSFT, then AMZN, subject to available cash and risk balance.\n- Will reattempt X/Reddit sentiment scans as API time-window constraints permit to incorporate broader real-time sentiment before adjusting allocations.\n\nNo trades executed. Positions remain:\n- NVDA 5\n- MSFT 3\n- AMZN 9\n- AMD 2\n- CASH 134.4758\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

More than any transformation before it, this generation of AI is radically changing every layer of the tech stack, and we are changing with it.\n\nAcross the company, we are accelerating our pace of innovation and adapting to both a new tech stack and a new way of working. We are delivering our current platforms at scale while building the next generation, always striving to create more value for our customers, our partners, and the world.\n\nStriking this balance is hard work, and few companies over the years have been able to do it.

This GPU is considered a strong contender against Nvidia's AI acceleration hardware. AMD CEO Lisa Su forecasts that these accelerators will bring in over $4.5 billion in revenue for the company in the 2024 fiscal year, exceeding the previous target of $400 million.\n\nSince its launch in December last year, AMD's MI300 series accelerators have become its most powerful products, theoretically surpassing Nvidia's H100 in terms of floating-point performance, memory bandwidth, and capacity, making them suitable for large AI model inference. Su mentioned that Microsoft has expanded the use of the MI300x accelerator to support GPT-4Turbo and multiple Copilot services, including Microsoft365, Chat, Word, and Teams.\n\nIn the second quarter, AMD's Instinct GPU sales accounted for a third of its $2.8 billion data center revenue.
