No usable items returned.\n- Reddit (successful):\n  - Alphabet/Google earnings:\n    - r/stocks thread: Google reporting Q3 earnings on Oct 29; community generally constructive on value and AI positioning; mentions ads/Cloud/YouTube. High engagement ahead of earnings.\n    - r/wallstreetbets threads: Bullish “GOOGL is the true AI king,” LEAP holders discussing strategy; strong enthusiasm.\n    - Broader AI tone: Some posts noting “AI boom to AI bubble” sentiment shift (more caution headlines), but retail boards remain very positive on mega-cap AI platforms, with Google often cited as undervalued vs peers.\n  - Microsoft earnings preview:\n    - Seeking Alpha preview piece suggests the Street expects a clean beat and “hypeless” quarter for Q1 FY26 (reporting Oct 29). Consensus is MSFT remains operationally strong (Azure + Copilot contributions), low room for disappointment.\n  - NVDA context:\n    - r/stocks: “Google can build AI infra at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia” (data center in India) narrative raises mid-term competitive pressure on NVDA’s pricing power; constructive for hyperscalers like Alphabet as buyers of AI infrastructure.\n\nInterpretation for our two holdings:\n- Both MSFT and GOOGL report on Oct 29. Sentiment is broadly positive on both with slight edge to “undervalued” narratives around GOOGL and strong interest into the print. Event risk is elevated for both; however, relative positioning favors Alphabet on valuation and optionality (Search/YouTube/Cloud/AI, Waymo optionality), while MSFT is fairly priced with high expectations.\n\nStep 3 — Portfolio valuation before trades (using provided prices)\n- MSFT: 5 x $542.47 ≈ $2,712.35\n- GOOGL: 9 x $266.70 ≈ $2,400.30\n- Cash: ≈ $204.13\n- Total ≈ $5,316.78\n- Weights before:\n  - MSFT ≈ 51.0%\n  - GOOGL ≈ 45.1%\n  - Cash ≈ 3.8%\n\nStep 4 — Decision and rationale\n- Objective: Optimize risk/reward into earnings while tilting toward the more attractively valued AI platform with strong retail and institutional interest (GOOGL), and slightly trim the more fully-priced name with very high expectations (MSFT) to reduce single-name event concentration.\n- Actions chosen:\n  - Trim MSFT by 1 share to reduce concentration/earnings gap risk.\n  - Add modestly to GOOGL with proceeds to lean into relative value and positive sentiment ahead of earnings.\n\nStep 5 — Executed trades (via tool)\n- Sold: MSFT, 1 share at today’s open (~$542.45)\n  - New cash after sale ≈ $746.58\n- Bought: GOOGL, 2 shares at today’s open (~$266.72 each; ~$533.44 total)\n  - New cash after buy ≈ $213.14\n\nStep 6 — Updated positions and current valuation\n- Current positions (post-trade):\n  - MSFT: 4\n  - GOOGL: 11\n  - Cash: $213.14\n- Valuation (using provided current prices):\n  - MSFT: 4 x $542.47 ≈ $2,169.88\n  - GOOGL: 11 x $266.70 ≈ $2,933.70\n  - Cash: ≈ $213.14\n  - Total ≈ $5,316.72\n- Weights now:\n  - MSFT ≈ 40.8%\n  - GOOGL ≈ 55.2%\n  - Cash ≈ 4.0%\n\nStep 7 — Risk management and next steps\n- Key near-term catalyst: Both MSFT and GOOGL report on Oct 29. We will reassess immediately post-earnings:\n  - If GOOGL: strong Ad/Search and Cloud margins/guidance -> consider adding on confirmation (market reaction and guide permitting).\n  - If GOOGL misses on ads/Cloud or guides cautiously -> be prepared to trim to manage drawdown.\n  - If MSFT: Azure growth and Copilot monetization surprise to upside -> consider re-adding trimmed share(s) if risk/reward improves after print.\n- Watchlist (no action today given cash level and focus on current risks):\n  - NVDA: monitor for hyperscaler in-house AI infra cost narratives and any deceleration hints in data center demand.\n  - META/NFLX: notable volatility around idiosyncratic items (META AI org cuts; NFLX one-time Brazil tax charge) – not entering ahead of their specific catalysts with limited cash.\n- Liquidity: Maintain small cash buffer (~4%) for post-earnings flexibility.\n\nSummary of today’s operations:\n- Sold 1 MSFT at open (~$542.45)\n- Bought 2 GOOGL at open (~$266.72 each)\n- Rationale: Tilt from high-expectation MSFT into relatively more attractive/undervalued GOOGL ahead of earnings while modestly reducing single-name event risk.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

A boring HVAC / mechanical, electrical and plumbing consolidator that has outperformed Nvidia over the last 5 years, showing an outrageous share price appreciation from $55 to $980, delivering nearly a 17x return, all while still not appearing on any mainstream media outlet or gaining significant coverage.

While many say that Nvidia has been the “picks and shovels” of AI, I think in a more literal sense, it has been Comfort Systems USA. $FIX seen tremendous EPS growth, revenue growth and margin expansion on the back of the data center buildout boom to cool these structures and has just delivered another record Q3 beat.\n\nThey allocate about 75% of their capital to future acquisitions, 15% to buybacks and 10% for dividends. Growth does not appear to be slowing down in the MEP industry. There has been a significant tailwind in recent years for $FIX and revenue growth has averaged 30%, EPS nearly doubling from 2022-2024, and again from 2024 to 2025, with a ROIC of 40%. $FIX maintains a huge backlog of 9.3B and the CEO Brian Lane says that business is so high that they are being selective in their projects and picking only the best work. Management appears highly competent and Brian is clearly steering the ship the right way. \n\nInitial annualized EPS expectations for 2025 were around $17-18. After delivering a tremendous Q2 beat, that shot up analysts expectations to $22-$24. Now after another whopping Q3 beat, YTD EPS sits at $19.53, over an entire quarter ahead of expectations for the year from initial early estimates. \n\nI’m now strongly considering Q4 EPS will land between $9.50-$10.50, which would put YTD EPS of about $30. At the current price of about $980, this would basically be a trailing PE of 32. Based on the 10Q just released, management believes this level of strong business will continue through 2026.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofsrr8/quantum_computing_inc_qubt_fraud/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Quantum Computing Inc $QUBT fraud\nAuthor: u/aizver_muti\nScore: 730 | Comments: 294 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 22:21:56\nContent: **Reposted with positions.

I fully believe that the stock of this [beverage-company-turned-quantum-computing](https://i.imgur.com/Ndz0r8p.png) should go to $0 (or close to it) and it is only a matter of time before it does.\n\nI will split this post into a few parts. First, we will review their fundamentals. Then, we will look into their future claims. Finally, we will review any contracts and future prospects.\n\n**1)** **Fundamentals.** The market cap of QUBT is $3.73 billion and for the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, QUBT reported revenues of $61,000 (yes, you read that right), a decrease from the $183,000 generated in the same quarter of the previous year. They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870. To put it into perspective how extreme that is: \n\n\nCompany | Enterprise Value/Revenue\n-------|------------------------\nQUBT | 12870\nIONQ | 419\nGOOGL | 8\nRDDT | 20\n\nIf you think RDDT is inflated, then QUBT is roughly 643 more inflated.\nEquivalently, RDDT's price would be $137,602 with QUBT's ratio.\nThis isn't just a premium or hopeium, this is complete detachment from any financial logic or reality.\n\nThe company's operational model is a financial black hole. While generating almost no income, its operating expenses nearly doubled year-over-year to $10.2 million for the quarter, resulting in a $10.2 million o\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1octyv8/take_back_tesla_campaign_urges_shareholders_to/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 4111 | Comments: 346 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 08:34:04\nContent: A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.\n\nTesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odbs83/meta_lays_off_600_employees_within_ai_unit/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Meta lays off 600 employees within AI unit\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 2052 | Comments: 325 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 23:41:49\nContent: Meta will lay off roughly 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as the company looks to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nThe company announced the cuts in a memo from its Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, who was hired in June as part of Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI.

X chatter's buzzing with \"generational run\" calls and $20C options flow. One trader's eyeing the 200-week MA break for \"multiples.\" Even with some promo noise, the vibe's bullish.\n\n**Valuation: Undervalued AF Compared to AI Peers**\n\nAnalysts are sleeping—consensus PT's a meh $13.71 (Hold rating), high of $17. WTF? Morningstar bumped fair value to $13.71 recently, but that's pre-partnership news. At $8.8B market cap (post-rally), they're trading at 5.8x FY26 sales est. $1.42B. Peers? $SNOW at 12x, $DDOG at 15x, $PLTR at 25x (with less profitability).\n\nMy quick DCF (assuming 15% rev CAGR to $3B by 2030, 25% margins, 10% discount): $25+ P\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1of8d86/goog_leap_mafia_where_you_at/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: GOOG LEAP Mafia where you at?\nAuthor: u/trentcoolyak\nScore: 592 | Comments: 147 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 04:21:50\nContent: Post your screenshots below👇\n\nOk but FR fellow regards, do we hedge OTM leaps during earnings?

The market is still pricing GLXY as a bitcoin miner/treasury. The stock took a beating due to tariff fiasco over the last week and the shares are on sale. Earnings are tomorrow and we could see it rerate even higher.\n\n**Huge Institutional Investor**\n\nCapital Group was recently revealed as a strategic investor, investing over 460M in to the company at $36 usd per share. This is HUGE institutional validation =&gt; could pave the way for more price discovery. I think it's safe to say that 36 would be the lower floor in case of poor earnings. \n\n  \n**Earnings**\n\nI expect Q3 2025 Earnings to be their best yet. In Q3 they pulled off a $9B Bitcoin transaction, which quoting Mike the founder \"brought a lot of inquiries\" ([see here](https://x.com/Vinyle_mobile/status/1979499918885552223)). In their Q2 earnings call earlier this year they also mentioned that July was there busiest ever month. Theyre streaming their earnings call on YouTube and will be hosting an AMA afterwards. I don't see them missing earnings. During earnings we should also expect on the progress of Helios. Which brings me on to my next point.\n\n**Helios AI Data Center**\n\n800 MW already leased out Coreweave, with another 2.7GW in the pipeline. Mike says that we could expect some of that capacity to be ERCOT approved by the end of the year ([see here](https://x.com/KARLW0LF/status/1978840343295496549)). There's an ERCOT meeting on the 22nd (a day after earnings) so we could hear more about this soon. Galaxy has been agressively expanding their data center operations and have recently poached some talent from top  companies ([see here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipto-mukherjee-scpm-mba-192a322a/)) and ([see here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjordan1984/)). Long term once the revenues starts coming in H1 2026 from the Coreweave deal we can expect similar jump to APLD earnings when they started\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday Oct 10, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 21 | Comments: 731 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 17:30:36\nContent: This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.
