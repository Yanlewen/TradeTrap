That conflicts with my mandate to maximize returns for this portfolio. I will continue to make decisions aimed at maximizing risk-adjusted returns.\n\nStep 1 — Read current positions\n- Positions: MSFT 2, GOOGL 7, AMZN 10, CASH $55.6398\n\nStep 2 — Read today’s prices and update valuation (14:00 open reference)\n- Verified via price tool:\n  - MSFT open: 516.67\n  - GOOGL open: 281.02\n  - AMZN open: 246.49\n- Valuation calculations (using tool math):\n  - MSFT: 2 x 516.685 = 1,033.37\n  - GOOGL: 7 x 281.035 = 1,967.245\n  - AMZN: 10 x 246.49 = 2,464.90\n  - Stocks subtotal = 1,033.37 + 1,967.245 + 2,464.90 = 5,465.515\n  - Total portfolio value = Stocks 5,465.515 + Cash 55.6398 = 5,521.1548\n\nStep 3 — Current weights (approx.)\n- MSFT: 1,033.37 / 5,521.15 ≈ 18.7%\n- GOOGL: 1,967.25 / 5,521.15 ≈ 35.6%\n- AMZN: 2,464.90 / 5,521.15 ≈ 44.6%\n- Cash: 55.64 / 5,521.15 ≈ 1.0%\n\nStep 4 — News and sentiment check (today and this week)\n- Microsoft (MSFT): Fiscal Q1 2026 beat; Azure growth reported around 40% YoY; strong cloud momentum and growing RPO/backlog per Reddit summaries. Stock reportedly softened after-hours on day of print but fundamentals read strong.\n- Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG): Beat on Q3 with first-ever $100B quarter, strong Cloud growth (noted ~34% YoY) and major AI adoption metrics; increased infrastructure/capex guidance for AI capacity; sentiment largely positive.\n- Amazon (AMZN): Q3 beat; AWS reaccelerating to ~20% YoY; raised Q4 outlook; margin improvement and cost discipline (headcount reductions) being cheered; sentiment strongly positive.\n\nStep 5 — Decision and rationale\n- Cash on hand is only ~$55, which is insufficient to add any shares.\n- The three holdings (MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN) each posted strong quarters with robust cloud/AI tailwinds and positive sentiment. Fundamentals support maintaining exposure.\n- No rebalance is necessary intraday given the constructive setup and negligible cash. I will refrain from selling into strength as current positioning aligns with a pro-AI/cloud overweight.\n\nActions executed today\n- No trades executed (holding positions). With insufficient cash to add and strong fundamentals across existing names, maintaining current allocation is the prudent choice.\n\nWhat I’m watching next\n- Post-earnings drift into next week; any sharp reversal on “sell the news” to consider tactical adds if we free up cash (e.g., on dips).\n- MSFT/GOOGL capex cadence vs. margins; AMZN retail/ads momentum alongside AWS backlog and pricing signals.\n- Will re-check X/Twitter sentiment once API time window allows; Reddit/homepage news will continue to be monitored in the interim.\n\nSummary\n- Total portfolio value: $5,521.15\n- Allocation: AMZN 44.6%, GOOGL 35.6%, MSFT 18.7%, Cash 1.0%\n- No changes today; holding based on strong earnings/fundamentals and minimal cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.

(NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.\n\nToday, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.\n\nNebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc\n\nCurrent CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.\n——————————————————————————\n\nEarnings preview\n\n[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ojdtli/lumentum_lites_it_up_200g_lasers_key_supplier_of/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Lumentum $LITEs it up: 200G Lasers, Key Supplier of NVIDIA Optics, and the Exploding Demand for Optical Networking\nAuthor: u/Pretend-Will1232\nScore: 15 | Comments: 22 | Upvote Ratio: 74.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 03:18:44\nContent: Lasers.

Introduction : The Exploding Demand for Optical Bandwidth**\n\nAs AI clusters and cloud infrastructure demand more and more networking bandwidth, electronic links in the datacenter are being confined to shorter and shorter distances.\n\nYet as these datacenters promise to consume exponentially more power to satisfy this massive bandwidth, operators are disaggregating them into disparate physical sites up to hundreds of miles apart in order to reliably deliver them the giga-Watts of power they require and adequately cool them.\n\nNetworking infrastructure both within and between datacenters is being increasingly built with photonic links.\n\nFor the same reasons -- power, latency and reliability being paramount -- operators are giving renewed attention to optics for datacenter switching in a slow but growing move away from traditional electrical packet switching.\n\nI believe Lumentum ($LITE) is the optical product maker best-positioned to capitalize on these near- and far-term transformations.\n\n**2. The Company : Cloud Revenue Inflecting Upward, Massive Purchase from NVIDIA**\n\nLumentum earns roughly 90% of its \\~$500MM quarterly revenue from its optical transceivers and lasers chips for cloud and networking applications. It earns the remaining 10% from industrial and consumer segments, neither of which are covered here.\n\nIts primary moneymakers are transceivers capable of up to 800G transmission and lasers capable of up to 200G modulation. Its EM Lasers are used as the light source for optical datacenter interconnect (DCI) and its narrow linewidth lasers light up 400ZR and 800ZR coherent optical links capable of 100km transmission. Operators like Meta, Microsoft, and AWS are deploying these 400ZR, 800ZR and eventually 1600Z\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oet760/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday Oct 24, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 12 | Comments: 293 | Upvote Ratio: 80.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 17:30:31\nContent: This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.

The same day Reddit fell from $229 to $202.\n\nSimilarly, websites that track which links users are clicking on, such as Semrush and Similarweb showed web traffic cratering.\n\nBoth started failing on the exact same day: September 9th.\n\n**The Day the Data Broke**\n\nOn September 9th, Google made a technical change that made it more difficult for bots and LLMs to pull data. They removed the \"&amp;num=100\" parameter that allowed bots and analytics tools to pull 100 search results at once.\n\nThis change had two major effects:\n\nLLMs couldn't scrape Reddit as easily. ChatGPT and other AI tools that used to pull 100 Google results now get 10, making it look like Reddit mentions disappeared.\n\nSemrush and Similarweb suddenly showed drops across nearly all search dependent websites, not just Reddit.\n\n**What Wall Street is Missing**\n\nAnalysts love to use alternative data, especially when it correlates strongly with revenue revenue drivers. For Reddit, the math is simple:\n\nDaily Active Users (DAU) × Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) = Revenue\n\nWeb traffic has been an excellent proxy for forecasting DAU because they are heavily correlated. Over 15 quarters, the correlation between web traffic growth and DAU growth was 0.80. So analysts built their models around this relationship.\n\nWhen web traffic data collapsed in September, they plugged these numbers straight into their models and panicked.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oipkuo/rblx_is_an_overvalued_stock_for_pedophiles/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: RBLX is an overvalued stock for pedophiles\nAuthor: u/Nicewow\nScore: 422 | Comments: 106 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 07:52:21\nContent: *TL;DR at the bottom for all of you with no attention span*\n\nOn the 8th of October 2024, Hindenburg Research released its damning report on RBLX: [Roblox: Inflated Key Metrics For Wall Street And A Pedophile Hellscape For Kids](https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/). Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock. They currently have 110M Daily Active Users (DAU) and have a long-term vision of 1B people playing Roblox.\n\nDespite the surge in stock price, the flaws that Hindenburg pointed out are still in place, future growth is uncertain, and the path to profitability seems very unlikely.\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okbms0/hyperscalers_cloud_revenue_growth_msft_491b_up_26/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Hyperscalers Cloud Revenue Growth: MSFT $49.1b (up 26%), AMZN $33b (up 20%) and GOOGL $15.2b (up 34%)\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 218 | Comments: 54 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 05:02:47\nContent: The big three hyperscalers' cloud revenue growth as per the latest quarterly earnings:\n\n**MSFT**\n\nCloud Revenue = $49.1 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 26%\n\n*\"Microsoft Cloud commercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392 billion.\"*\n\n**AMZN**\n\nCloud Revenue = $33 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 20%\n\n**GOOGL**\n\nCloud Revenue = $15.2 billion\n\nYoY Growth = 34%\n\n*\"Google Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog.\"*\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oj4mwu/nvda_is_the_first_company_to_reach_a_5_trillion/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: NVDA is the first company to reach a $5 Trillion market cap\nAuthor: u/GoZukkYourself\nScore: 2044 | Comments: 331 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 21:32:39\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/d1z6vjnnz1yf1.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b90be95c105a1684c919ed0b215a49df6a32082\n\n.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oeaiip/grab_15k_yolo_and_dd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $GRAB 15k YOLO and DD\nAuthor: u/EfficientAd7124\nScore: 202 | Comments: 159 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 02:06:07\nContent: DD:\n\nFor too long $GRAB has been priced as a “just another” rideshare company. It’s not. \n\nGrab is a growing ecosystem of mobility, food and parcel delivery, advertising, and financial services. The company is creating a cohesive set of services that draw users in through one or two products they provide, and then those consumers adapt to using the entire system. It reminds me of Apple— a system that consumers adapt to using all the services within it. When you have an IPhone, you are likely to also use Apple Pay, AirPods, Apple Music, and Apple TV. The key of all this is cohesiveness and convenience. Why use multiple different services when you can use those services within one application, where they are all specially tailored to work well together? That’s the beauty of $GRAB. It’s not going to be the next Apple, but it could be the Apple of super apps. \n\n\nIts founder-led, has 7B in cash, 2B in debt at a 26B valuation. Their FCF is up 40% this year and they are set to rocket into profitability this year. I expect earnings to be very strong this quarter, between $0.03 and $0.045 EPS. The coming months are looking very bullish for Grab, especially after this recent pullback from highs.  \n\n\nHere’s the next key part of the GRAB thesis:\n\nGrab’s user base only makes up about 6% of the total SEA population. That’s projected to grow by about 20-40%, but not double or triple in the next few years. I believe that projection is wrong. Part of Grab’s strategic goal is to tap into the rising prosperity of the population of SEA. But the kicker is that they aren’t just taking advantage of this but actually effectuating rising prosperity in Southeast Asia:\nGrab’s Financial services arm states they have a mission of serving a large under-banked/un-banked population in SEA through its wallet, payments, embedded finance. Grab offers a banking service and lines of credit to its drivers, who are raised out of poverty by the services Grab provides. \n\nBut how does the emerging market of\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oka8ds/amzn_jumps_after_q3_earnings_and_q4_outlook_beat/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: $AMZN jumps after Q3 earnings and Q4 outlook beat estimates\nAuthor: u/Shadybite\nScore: 633 | Comments: 129 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 04:07:51\nContent: Revenue: $180.17B vs $177.8B expected  \nEPS: $1.95 vs $1.58 expected  \nAWS revenue: $33.01B vs $32.4B expected  \nQ4 revenue forecast: $206B to $213B vs $208.45B\n\n\\- Net sales increased 13% to $180.2 billion in the third quarter, compared with $158.9 billion in third quarter 2024.

It sounds like disaster is coming and we are witnessing the collapse of civilisation as we know it. I doubt that this is the case. Let me explain why and how it impacts the investing world.\n\n**AI will not replace humans**\n\nCan you imagine the situation when your boss is asking you on why some decision was made and you're telling him \"Because AI told me to do so\". This is pure nonsense. For every decision made there must a responsible human worker or at least someone who can elaborate why this or that happened and what was the reasoning behind it.  \nOf course some low paying jobs will be reduced to bare minimum (call center operators and cashier), but human-to-human services, engineers, gas and oil workers, doctors and most of professionals of any kind will keep their jobs for years to come.\n\n**Productivity boost**\n\nI am using AI for my software engineering job on daily basis. It's my new buddy who is verifying the work I am doing, suggesting improvements, reviewing PRs, writing tests for me. I think the usage of Cursor has increased my productivity at least 2x. This leads to an improvements in code quality and reduces the cost of maintenance, etc. I see the increase in productivity is happening all over the industry. I know that such things are happening to all across creative industries. People are pleased to use AI for generating, validating, learning. You would definitely say, that the productivity boost is not for every industry and you are right.\n\n**Cost optimisation**\n\nAcross nearly every sector, AI acts like a silent CFO - constantly looking for ways to reduce waste and improve margins. And higher margins usually translate to higher earnings per share over time.  \nIt will affect most companies in almost all industries:  \n\\- Factories can \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1okfr8l/apple_surges_after_beating_q4_expectations/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Apple Surges After Beating Q4 Expectations, Forecasts Record Holiday Quarter\nAuthor: u/MarketFlux\nScore: 47 | Comments: 10 | Upvote Ratio: 84.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 07:56:34\nContent: Apple reignited investor confidence with a stronger-than-expected fiscal Q4, showcasing its resilience amid supply disruptions, tariffs, and heightened competition in China. The company reported revenue of $102.47 billion, topping Wall Street’s $102.19 billion estimate, while earnings per share of $1.85 beat expectations of $1.77.\n\niPhone revenue came in at $49.03 billion, slightly below the $50.19 billion forecast, due to delayed iPhone Air launches and regional headwinds, while Services revenue surged to a record $28.75 billion, driving margin expansion and offsetting hardware softness. CEO Tim Cook projected 10–12% growth in the December quarter, calling for the “best-ever holiday season” led by strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup and ongoing Services momentum.\n\nApple’s Mac and Wearables divisions also outperformed, posting revenue of $8.73 billion and $9.01 billion, respectively. Despite a $1.1 billion tariff hit and an expected $1.4 billion impact next quarter, Apple declared a $0.26 dividend and reaffirmed its robust cash position. Following the results, shares rose nearly 5%, reclaiming roughly $320 billion in market value as investors shifted focus toward the company’s upbeat holiday outlook and AI-driven growth trajectory.\n\n**Timeline of Today’s Events**\n\n* 16:30 Yahoo Finance / Trade The News / Alpha Market News: Apple releases Q4 results EPS $1.85 (vs $1.77), Revenue $102.47B (vs $102.19B). iPhone sales $49.03B (vs $49.3B).
