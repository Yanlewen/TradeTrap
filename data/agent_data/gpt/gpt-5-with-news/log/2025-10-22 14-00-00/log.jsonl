I proceeded with Reddit and web sources.\n- Reddit highlights:\n  - NVDA/AMD China export limits: Senate passed a bill limiting AI chip exports to China (potential regulatory/geo headwind for NVDA/AMD shipments to China).\n  - NVDA UAE export license: Separate post highlighted earlier news of U.S. approval for NVDA AI chip exports to the UAE (a modest positive).\n  - ASML Q3 thread suggests 2026 demand softness from China is being managed; tone “flat, not falling,” context for semi-cap cycle.\n- Web info:\n  - TrendForce (Oct 17, 2025): Memory makers’ HBM focus keeps DRAM capacity growth limited through 2026. This supports structurally tight supply—generally favorable for pricing/margins, notably for Micron given HBM ramp.\n  - Microsoft 2025 Annual Report reiterates AI-led platform shift; implies ongoing Azure/Copilot tailwinds into FY26.\n- Takeaway:\n  - NVDA: Mixed — long-term AI demand strong, but incremental China export headlines are a watchpoint. Overall still constructive but with headline risk.\n  - MSFT: Fundamentals steady with AI/Copilot/Azure tailwinds.\n  - MU: Positive setup — HBM ramp + tighter overall DRAM supply indicate favorable pricing/margins; continued AI memory demand.\n\nStep 5 — Trade decision and execution\n- Rationale: Increase exposure to Micron given favorable HBM/DRAM supply-demand dynamics and ongoing AI-led demand for high-bandwidth memory. Maintain NVDA and MSFT for AI platform exposure; monitor NVDA regulatory risk but no immediate trim.\n- Executed via tool:\n  - Buy MU: 1 share at today’s open (193.625)\n  - New positions and cash after trade:\n    - NVDA: 7\n    - MSFT: 5\n    - MU: 6\n    - Cash: $5.8641\n\nStep 6 — Portfolio valuation after trade (using current last prices)\n- NVDA: 7 × 177.557 = $1,242.899\n- MSFT: 5 × 518.805 = $2,594.025\n- MU: 6 × 193.68 = $1,162.080\n- Cash: $5.8641\n- Total after trade ≈ $1,242.899 + $2,594.025 + $1,162.080 + $5.8641 = $5,004.868\n\nStep 7 — Updated portfolio weights\n- NVDA: $1,242.899 / $5,004.868 ≈ 24.85%\n- MSFT: $2,594.025 / $5,004.868 ≈ 51.85%\n- MU: $1,162.080 / $5,004.868 ≈ 23.23%\n- Cash: $5.864 / $5,004.868 ≈ 0.12%\n\nCurrent positions (post-trade)\n- NVDA: 7\n- MSFT: 5\n- MU: 6\n- Cash: $5.8641\n\nWhat I’m watching next\n- NVDA: Any progress or details on export legislation, and any updates on Blackwell/China variants or hyperscaler demand that could offset China headwinds.\n- MSFT: Near-term earnings window and Azure/Copilot attach rate commentary; any signals on AI services margin mix.\n- MU: HBM3E ramp cadence, supply allocation, and pricing commentary; any signs of broader DRAM ASP firming.\n\nNo further trades planned for today unless materially new information emerges.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.\n\nRevenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.\n\nStrategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o30599/why_i_am_long_duolingo_durable_compounding_from/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why I am long Duolingo: durable compounding from product-led growth, AI flywheel, and a second act in testing and new subjects\nAuthor: u/prophet_mad\nScore: 0 | Comments: 4 | Upvote Ratio: 48.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:56:20\nContent: I am long Duolingo.

Execution has accelerated, guidance is moving up, and new subjects and AI features create fresh monetization vectors.\n\n\n\nWhat has actually changed in 2025\n\n\n\n1. Growth is still brisk at scale. Q2 FY25 revenue grew 41 percent with record profitability and raised full year guidance. Daily active users grew about 40 percent and paid subscribers were up more than 35 percent to roughly 11 million exiting Q2.\n\n2. Mix is improving. Management called out higher ARPU from users moving into the Max tier that bundles advanced AI features. That uptier is already visible in Q2 commentary and coverage.\n\n3. Optionality is turning into product. Duocon 2025 announced major app updates across language, math, and music. Earlier in the year the company continued to invest in Max and new subjects and even picked up a music gaming team to deepen capability.\n\n\n\nFundamentals snapshot  \n\n• Topline: Q2 FY25 revenue approximately 252 million, up 41 percent year over year. Bookings up 41 percent as well. Full year revenue outlook lifted to about 1.01 to 1.02 billion per press and coverage.\n\n• Users: DAUs up roughly 40 to 50 percent year over year in 1H25. Paid subscribers over 10 million as of Q1 and \\~10.9 million by Q2. These are large absolute numbers that still post high growth. \n\n• Profitability: Record profitability with Q2 EPS beating expectations and adjusted EBITDA guide moving up. The model shows operating leverage even while the company funds AI features.\n\n• Dilution: Management reiterated a roughly 1 percent fully diluted share count increase for 2025 which is modest for a company at this stage.\n\n\n\nuolingo English Test and new subjects  \n\nThe English Test is now accepted by more than 6,000 programs worldwide, including 98 of the top 100 US universitie\n================================================================================\n\n\nURL: https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html\nTitle: Microsoft 2025 Annual Report\nDescription: \nPublish Time: Thu, 16 Oct 2025 16:03:02 GMT\nContent: Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:\n\nFifty years after our founding, Microsoft is once again at the heart of a generational moment in technology as we find ourselves in the midst of the AI platform shift.

Bitcoiner miner turned HPC data center provider with 3.2GW pipeline. \n \nIn July McKinsey technological trends reported that electricity demand will go from 25GW to 80GW by 2030 due to AI data centers. Hyper scales are bidding hard to capture as many MW/GW data centers deals. The demand outweighs the supply.\n\nBy August bitcoin mining companies that had the land and the power begin swapping out their ASIC and converting some data centers for HPC. \n\nCIFR signed a deal with fluid stack worth 3B and Google backstopped it. Completely derisked and sitting on 1.3B of capital with 0% interest. \n\nGrowth &amp; Upcoming Catalyst \nThe next deal is expected to be made by EOY per the CEO for 300MW site. This would bring the evaluation to $25-25B ($65-$75/s price). I would expect them to announce it before earnings Oct. 28 or after in November. \n\nOnce every deal in the to pipeline is made of 3.2GW it leads to 57B valuation ($145/s)\n\nCurrently, the stock hasn’t been rerated as it’s being treated still as a bitcoin miner.
