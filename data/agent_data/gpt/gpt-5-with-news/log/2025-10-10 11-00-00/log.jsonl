More than any transformation before it, this generation of AI is radically changing every layer of the tech stack, and we are changing with it.\n\nAcross the company, we are accelerating our pace of innovation and adapting to both a new tech stack and a new way of working. We are delivering our current platforms at scale while building the next generation, always striving to create more value for our customers, our partners, and the world.\n\nStriking this balance is hard work, and few companies over the years have been able to do it. To succeed, we must continue to think in decades but execute in quarters, approaching each day with the humility and curiosity required to continuously improve, while being guided by our bold vision for the future.\n\nFinancially, it was a ...\n\n\nURL: https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays\nTitle: Prime Big Deal Days 2025\nDescription: Prime Big Deal Days is Amazon's deal event on October 7-8 exclusively for Prime members, featuring two days of epic deals ahead of the holiday season.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Prime Big Deal Days 2025\n\n===============\n\n![Image 1: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:138-4192240-5227026:V7G26J7E49T5Q9TEP8MM$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fstaticb%26id%3DV7G26J7E49T5Q9TEP8MM:0)![Image 2: This image contains a collection of Amazon logos, slogans like smile and prime, and various icons such as search, location, cart, menu, profile, and directional arrows](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global-1x-reorg-privacy._CB779528203_.png)[](https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays)\nSkip to\n-------\n\n*   [Main content](https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays#skippedLink)\n\n* * *\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n------------------\n\n*   [Search opt+/](javascript:void(0))\n*   [Cart shift+opt+C](javascript:void(0))\n*   [Home shift+opt+H](javascript:void(0))\n*   [Orders shift+opt+O](javascript:void(0))\n*   Show/Hide shortcuts shift+opt+Z  \n\nTo move between items, use your keyboard's up or down arrows.\n\n[.us](https:/...\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-03T11:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-03T11:00Z'.
