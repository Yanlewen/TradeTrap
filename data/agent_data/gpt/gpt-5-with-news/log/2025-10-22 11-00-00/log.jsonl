EU issue around Teams bundling avoided fines by unbundling (Sept 2025) — neutral/slightly positive.\n- Micron (MU):\n  - Samsung publicly showcasing HBM4 (Wccftech, 2025-10-22), underscoring rising competition in HBM; while AI memory demand is strong, medium-term pricing/margins could face competitive pressure. Net: still favorable demand backdrop, but competitive dynamics to monitor.\n\nStep 3 — Portfolio valuation before any trades (using current value prices)\n- NVDA: 5 x 180.685 = 903.425\n- MSFT: 6 x 524.91 = 3149.46\n- MU: 5 x 198.75 = 993.75\n- Cash: 37.8491\n- Total pre-trade value ≈ 903.425 + 3149.46 + 993.75 + 37.8491 = 5084.4841\n\nStep 4 — Trade decisions and execution (via tools)\nRationale:\n- Sector and news flow remain constructive for semiconductors and AI infrastructure. NVDA’s demand drivers appear robust with incremental catalysts (export approvals, data center expansion), while MSFT faces an earnings event next week (potentially higher event risk in the near term). MU remains a beneficiary of AI memory demand but faces rising competition over the medium term; we keep MU unchanged and monitor HBM pricing dynamics.\n- Action: Modest rotation to increase NVDA exposure funded by trimming MSFT by 1 share.\n\nExecuted trades:\n- Sold: MSFT 1 share at open (functions.sell)\n  - Resulting cash: 562.7591\n- Bought: NVDA 3 shares at open (functions.buy)\n  - Resulting cash: 20.7191\n\nStep 5 — Updated positions, valuation, and weights (post-trades)\nCurrent positions:\n- NVDA: 8\n- MSFT: 5\n- MU: 5\n- Cash: 20.7191\n\nValuation (using provided current value prices):\n- NVDA: 8 x 180.685 = 1445.48\n- MSFT: 5 x 524.91 = 2624.55\n- MU: 5 x 198.75 = 993.75\n- Cash: 20.7191\n- Total post-trade value ≈ 1445.48 + 2624.55 + 993.75 + 20.7191 = 5084.4991\n\nWeights:\n- NVDA: 1445.48 / 5084.4991 ≈ 28.4%\n- MSFT: 2624.55 / 5084.4991 ≈ 51.6%\n- MU: 993.75 / 5084.4991 ≈ 19.6%\n- Cash: 20.7191 / 5084.4991 ≈ 0.4%\n\nStep 6 — Notes and monitoring\n- MSFT: Earnings 10/29 — we trimmed slightly to reduce near-term event risk after strong run; will reassess post-guide on Azure/Copilot trends.\n- NVDA: Increased exposure on continued AI infra momentum and supportive demand updates. Monitor any supply/rack integration bottlenecks; near-term tape remains favorable.\n- MU: Hold; demand tailwinds exist, but keep an eye on HBM competitive dynamics (Samsung, SK Hynix) and potential pricing implications.\n\nToday’s actions summary:\n- Sold MSFT: 1 share\n- Bought NVDA: 3 shares\n- Final positions and weights updated above.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ochvdl/meta_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager\nAuthor: u/Quick_Increase6718\nScore: 20 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 61.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 00:38:15\nContent: My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 866 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.\n\nThe restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.\n\nAs with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.\n\n“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.\n\nBattery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.\n\nFull story and source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-weapon-us-trade-talks-160949069.html\n\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o87kqx/why_isnt_asml_ripping_like_other_ai_stocks_after/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why Isn’t ASML Ripping Like Other AI Stocks After Great Earnings?\nAuthor: u/Johnny_Yukon\nScore: 113 | Comments: 100 | Upvote Ratio: 84.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 22:25:45\nContent: ASML crushed earnings and is up big year to date, yet management signaled 2026 could be flat to slightly up versus 2025 while China demand declines.
