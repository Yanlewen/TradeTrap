But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.\n\nThe restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.\n\nAs with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.\n\n“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.\n\nBattery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.\n\nFull story and source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-weapon-us-trade-talks-160949069.html\n\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o282hj/rare_earths_stocks_surge_after_china_tightens/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Rare earths stocks surge after China tightens grip on global supplies\nAuthor: u/WickedSensitiveCrew\nScore: 264 | Comments: 51 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 22:53:54\nContent: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/china-tightens-rare-earths-grip-stocks-surge.html\n\n&gt; Shares of U.S. rare earth and critical mineral miners surged Thursday after China tightened restrictions on exports, fuelling market speculation that the Trump administration will move more aggressively to invest in building out a domestic supply chain. Ramaco Resources soared 12%, Energy Fuels surged nearly 8%, USA Rare Earth jumped more than 7%, and MP Materials rallied more than 6%. Lithium Americas popped more than 4% and Trilogy Metals rose more than 6%. Beijing is now requiring foreign entities to obtain a license to export products that contain more than 0.1% of domestically sourced rare earths, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce. Companies will also need export licenses if they use China’s extraction, refining or magnet recycling technology.\n\n&gt; China imposed the restrictions ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul, South Korea later this month. Rare earths have been a major point of contention in trade talks between Beijing and Washington. The White House and the U.S. critical mineral industry have accused China of manipulating the market to drive foreign competition out of business.

As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward.\n\nWe tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. \n\nWe will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. \n\nSimilar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. \n\nThe downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. \n\nOf course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. \n\nAnd for the love of god, stop \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o4su05/tech_destroyed_is_it_time_to_rotate_to_defensives/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Tech destroyed - is it time to rotate to defensives at ATHs amidst volatility?\nAuthor: u/Creative-Cranberry47\nScore: 0 | Comments: 70 | Upvote Ratio: 14.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-13 00:00:55\nContent: Nasdaq fell 3.56% &amp; S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.71% Friday. Crypto took a massive dump. though, there were some notable sectors that did better than some others. Friday just showed some people that no one is immune and that during volatile sessions, momentum stocks will get hammered. Lessons have been learned, and in theory, that should push investors to trade more conservative to avoid mass drawdowns in the future. Also, if trump doesn't TACO, look for inflation &amp; tariff proof sectors like utilities, healthcare or insurance. In theory, we should see some sector rotation amidst the volatility, as investors are humbled.\n\nI personally love the P&amp;C insurance sector, as auto or home insurance is a necessity during recessions. People will need their car to drive to work. insurance business's continue to improve during recessions, and they compound over time. Its one of the reasons why many of the greats like warren Buffett absolutely love insurance.\n\nPersonally, $ROOT insurance sticks out to me as they offer superior pricing versus their legacy peers, which will attract budget conscious consumers during economy constraints. They are also building a network with the largest players in the auto industry including Hyundai &amp; Toyota. ROOT only trades at a 1.2B mcap or less than 1/100x the size of PGR despite being superior in key metrics all around. If someone wants both the alpha of AI/tech but the defensive nature of insurance during recessions, you will get that combination of ROOT. it has hit bottom support recently after taking a 55% drop in 6 months.\n\nIs this an early trend for rotation, or should everyone just buy the dips on tech? what sectors or stocks are you looking to get into?\n\nFinviz ETF reporting:\n\n* Consumer Staples +.15%\n* Utilities -.38%\n* Real Estate -1.17%\n* Insurance - 1.22%\n* Basic Materials - -1.72%\n* Healthcare -1.76%\n* Communication Services -2.21%\n* Financials -2.23%\n* Industrials -2.25%\n* Energy -2.69%\n* Consumer Cyclical- 3.65%\n* Technolo\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3p120/why_sealsq_might_age_better_than_rigetti/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why SEALSQ might age better than Rigetti\nAuthor: u/mojavetheory\nScore: 0 | Comments: 29 | Upvote Ratio: 48.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 15:06:51\nContent: $LAES → SEALSQ’s multiple sits at the lower fringe of the speculative continuum: anchored in practical domains like quantum security &amp; IoT hardware, rather than floating in the zero-gravity of science-fiction valuation narratives.

By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \\~1,500× &amp; 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity.
