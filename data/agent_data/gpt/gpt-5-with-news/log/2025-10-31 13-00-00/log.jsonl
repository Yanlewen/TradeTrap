Market reaction and sentiment very positive.\n  - Reddit r/stocks thread: AMZN jumps after Q3 earnings and Q4 outlook beat estimates. Positive.\n- Microsoft (MSFT)\n  - Earnings beat: Revenue $77.7B vs $75.3B expected; Azure up ~40% YoY. Strong underlying results, though some chatter about Azure growth deceleration concerns. Net sentiment positive-to-neutral near term.\n- Alphabet (GOOGL)\n  - Reddit: “Alphabet tops $100B quarterly revenue for first time, cloud grows 34%”; threads highlight strong Google Cloud backlog and acceleration. Sentiment positive.\n\nOverall: All three holdings (AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT) show favorable fundamental momentum and positive-to-strong sentiment, with AMZN the clear leader on near-term momentum today post-earnings.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and trade plan\n- Constraints: Available cash is ~$55.64, insufficient to add any shares at current prices.\n- Rebalance consideration: Selling one holding to add to another would increase concentration and give up long-term strengths without clear expected incremental benefit. Given strong prints across all three, we maintain diversification and let winners run.\n- Action today: No trades. Maintain current allocations (AMZN/GOOGL/MSFT) and very small cash balance.\n\nRationale:\n- AMZN has the strongest immediate catalyst and momentum (earnings beat, raised guidance/capex tied to AI). \n- GOOGL’s cloud acceleration and ad/Search resilience continue to screen well on both growth and valuation.\n- MSFT remains a high-quality compounder with robust cloud growth and AI tailwinds; no strong reason to trim to chase.\n\nStep 5 — What we’re watching next\n- AMZN post-earnings follow-through and any revisions/analyst commentary on capex and AWS margin trajectory.\n- GOOGL commentary on Cloud profitability ramp and Search trends.\n- MSFT Azure growth sustainability and Copilot monetization updates.\n- With added cash (e.g., from future dividends, contributions, or dips), priority add order currently: AMZN ≈ GOOGL > MSFT, subject to price action and new data.\n\nNo trades executed. Positions unchanged:\n- MSFT: 2\n- GOOGL: 7\n- AMZN: 10\n- CASH: $55.64\n- Portfolio value: ~$5,507.81\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

This creates a massive overhang on the stock. Why?\n* Well, if Elon leaves, Tesla is cooked. The stock is trading at 360x P/E, with EPS projected to decline by over 30% yoy in FY 2025. It doesn't take two brain cells to click that Tesla stock is basically Elon's promises. Without him, Tesla would be a boomer automobile maker, trading at boomer P/E multiples (10x lower than today's)\n* I believe the $1T plan will go through, even though shareholders remain skeptical of the terms, the dilution it could bring, and the moonshot milestones required to hit the 1% stock unlock thresholds.\n\nAs the overhang (Elon leaving Tesla) dissipates, the stock could rip. I own $460, Nov. 7 call options to ride the wave. *(Note: watch me in the porn loss section next week)*\n\n**The $1T Compensation Plan Is THE Perfect Distraction From Fundamentals**\n\nThe noise around the 2025 shareholder meeting, where a decision on Elon's $1T compensation package will be made, is pretty much why the stock is still staying afloat after releasing terrible Q3 earnings results (despite the tailwind related to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit in September).\n\nTo understand what I mean by terrible, take a look at the revenue growth below (quarterly data):\n\n[Fiscal AI | Quarterly Revenue Growth \\(yoy change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek4lz67sj4yf1.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ec911d70f430773c3a8c9fece6601f2a93ba5ec)\n\nThe one-time bump in Q3 is laughable to say the least.\n\nSpeaking of laughable things, just take a look at all the promises th\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 867 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oj2mtf/fiserv_plummets_30_after_massive_earnings_miss/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Fiserv plummets 30% after massive earnings miss and guidance cut\nAuthor: u/ChillMeerkat\nScore: 104 | Comments: 69 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 20:02:40\nContent: The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.04 per share for the third quarter, falling far short of the $2.65 analysts had expected.

They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okaep4/reddit_releases_their_q3_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Reddit releases their Q3 earnings.\nAuthor: u/Serenity867\nScore: 868 | Comments: 202 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 04:14:39\nContent: [ Reddit Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results](https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2025/Reddit-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx)\n\n**Daily Active Uniques (“DAUq”) increased 19% year-over-year to 116.0 million**\n\n**Revenue grew 68% year-over-year to $585 million**\n\n**Gross margin expanded year-over-year to 91.0%**\n\n**Net income of $163 million, 28% of revenue.

It's the first mover, the cool kid on the block with \\~5,000 satellites in orbit and 2.6 million customers paying for the privilege. They proved this stuff works for real when they kept Ukraine online while the world was throwing money at them.\n\nSo what's it worth? Somewhere between a new car and a superyacht. Analysts are throwing out numbers from **$10 billion to a whopping $130 billion**. That's a huge range because nobody knows how to value a company that burns cash to build a sci-fi network in the sky. It's a pure-play bet on global internet, and it's a good one. SpaceX builds its own rockets, so they're printing satellites and launching them cheaper than anyone. That's their moat.\n\nBut Starlink is just an Internet Service Provider. A really, really cool one, but that's it. They sell you access and you pay the bill.\n\n# The Kuiper Gambit: Amazon's Checkmate Move\n\nNow, let's talk about the real play. Amazon's Project Kuiper.\n\nYou think Bezos is spending $15 billion extra a quarter just to launch some satellites so you can stream Netflix in the woods? Get real. Kuiper isn't a business; it's a weapon.\n\nThe strategy is so simple it's genius. Starlink's game plan is: Sell Internet -&gt; Get Money. Kuiper's game plan is: Sell Internet -&gt; Acquire Customer -&gt; Put them in the Amazon Flywheel FOR LIFE.\n\nThink about it. Kuiper brings a new customer online in a village in India or on a farm in Nebraska. Where do you think they're going to shop? Amazon. What cloud service will the local businesses there use? AWS. How will they get their stuff? Prime logistics. Kuiper is the ultimate customer acquisition tool, a top-of-funnel marketing machine for a $2 trillion empire. \\[Don't tak\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ojfjyr/meta_reports_earnings_sees_profits_hit_by_one/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Meta reports earnings, sees profits hit by one time tax charge, shares fall\nAuthor: u/Ok_Criticism_558\nScore: 391 | Comments: 148 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 04:24:26\nContent: Investing.com - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) reported third quarter EPS of $1.05, $5.63 worse than the analyst estimate of $6.68.

This creates a massive overhang on the stock. Why?\n* Well, if Elon leaves, Tesla is cooked. The stock is trading at 360x P/E, with EPS projected to decline by over 30% yoy in FY 2025. It doesn't take two brain cells to click that Tesla stock is basically Elon's promises. Without him, Tesla would be a boomer automobile maker, trading at boomer P/E multiples (10x lower than today's)\n* I believe the $1T plan will go through, even though shareholders remain skeptical of the terms, the dilution it could bring, and the moonshot milestones required to hit the 1% stock unlock thresholds.\n\nAs the overhang (Elon leaving Tesla) dissipates, the stock could rip. I own $460, Nov. 7 call options to ride the wave. *(Note: watch me in the porn loss section next week)*\n\n**The $1T Compensation Plan Is THE Perfect Distraction From Fundamentals**\n\nThe noise around the 2025 shareholder meeting, where a decision on Elon's $1T compensation package will be made, is pretty much why the stock is still staying afloat after releasing terrible Q3 earnings results (despite the tailwind related to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit in September).\n\nTo understand what I mean by terrible, take a look at the revenue growth below (quarterly data):\n\n[Fiscal AI | Quarterly Revenue Growth \\(yoy change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek4lz67sj4yf1.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ec911d70f430773c3a8c9fece6601f2a93ba5ec)\n\nThe one-time bump in Q3 is laughable to say the least.\n\nSpeaking of laughable things, just take a look at all the promises th\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oey7y3/weekly_earnings_thread_1027_1031/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/27 - 10/31\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 443 | Comments: 3741 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 21:47:41\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Search query 'Microsoft earnings October 2025 results guidance Copilot Azure growth' found no results.
