I will continue to apply fundamental and sentiment-driven analysis aimed at long-term performance.\n\nStep 1 — Read positions and today’s prices (2025-10-17 14:00:00)\n- Current positions: NVDA 10, MSFT 5, MU 3, INTC 1, CASH 0.9941\n- Prices used for valuation:\n  - NVDA_price: 182.8551\n  - MSFT_price: 513.15\n  - MU_price: 199.733\n  - INTC_price: 36.9938\n  - Cash: 0.9941\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation and portfolio weights\n- NVDA: 10 × 182.8551 = 1,828.551\n- MSFT: 5 × 513.15 = 2,565.750\n- MU: 3 × 199.733 = 599.199\n- INTC: 1 × 36.9938 = 36.9938\n- CASH: 0.9941\n- Total portfolio value ≈ 5,031.488\n\nWeights:\n- MSFT ≈ 2,565.750 / 5,031.488 = 50.99%\n- NVDA ≈ 1,828.551 / 5,031.488 = 36.35%\n- MU ≈ 599.199 / 5,031.488 = 11.91%\n- INTC ≈ 36.994 / 5,031.488 = 0.74%\n- CASH ≈ 0.994 / 5,031.488 = 0.02%\n\nStep 3 — Fresh news and sentiment check (tools used)\n- X (Twitter): The API window prevented querying the desired dates today; could not retrieve results due to platform time restrictions.\n- Reddit sentiment and recent news:\n  - NVIDIA (NVDA): Ongoing bullish sentiment tied to Blackwell/GB300 and Azure partnership clusters. Prior company updates highlighted record data center revenue and strong demand trends. Multiple Reddit posts highlight Azure deploying large-scale GB300 NVL72 clusters for OpenAI workloads.\n  - Microsoft (MSFT): Positive AI momentum (Azure scaling NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra), 2025 Annual Report tone constructive on AI stack monetization and execution. Community commentary generally bullish.\n  - Micron (MU): Positive sell-side revisions into and after earnings with DRAM/HBM demand tailwinds. Multiple PT raises noted in recent articles with strong HBM narrative. Reddit chatter leans bullish.\n  - TSMC backdrop: September 2025 monthly revenue solid, supporting overall semi demand supply chain health.\n  - Intel (INTC): Mixed; turnaround efforts “working to some extent” per some coverage, but secular competitiveness vs. leading-edge peers remains a question. No clear bullish inflection in sentiment vs. NVDA/MU.\n\nInterpretation:\n- AI infrastructure demand remains strong; NVDA/MSFT continue to exhibit strong positioning. MU benefits from HBM capacity and DRAM pricing upcycle. INTC remains a relatively small position with less compelling near-term upside vs. peers.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and any rebalancing\n- Constraints: Available cash ≈ $0.99. To add anything meaningful, we would need to sell a position first.\n- Portfolio construction view:\n  - Over 88% of capital is already in AI infrastructure leaders (MSFT, NVDA, MU), which aligns with positive fundamentals/sentiment.\n  - INTC is a minor 0.74% weight; selling it would only add ~$37 cash, still insufficient to fund a quality add without selling a larger position.\n  - Selling 1 MSFT to redeploy into NVDA/MU could be considered; however, both MSFT and NVDA are strong, and MSFT provides diversified AI monetization across software, cloud, and infra. Near-term there’s no compelling catalyst to reduce MSFT in favor of more concentrated semiconductor exposure intraday.\n- Action today: Hold all positions. No trades executed due to negligible cash and a satisfactory allocation biased to high-conviction AI winners. I will revisit rebalancing (e.g., trimming INTC and possibly a small MSFT slice) when:\n  - We have a specific high-conviction add with clear catalyst and/or\n  - Post-earnings dislocations offer a better entry, or\n  - Allocation drifts significantly from target or risk parameters.\n\nNext steps and monitoring\n- Track upcoming earnings/catalysts for MSFT, NVDA, MU; assess if earnings-day volatility creates rebalancing opportunities.\n- Consider trimming INTC on strength and redeploying into MU or NVDA if we need incremental exposure.\n- Retry X search when API window permits to keep sentiment and breaking news current.\n\nSummary\n- Updated portfolio value: ≈ $5,031.49\n- Weights: MSFT 50.99%, NVDA 36.35%, MU 11.91%, INTC 0.74%, Cash 0.02%\n- Trades today: None (hold)\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

It felt like that scene from Harry Potter where Hogwarts is trying to get in touch with Harry, except instead of being invited to attend a magical wizarding school I'm being told to proxy vote on three proposals for the future of my hard earned muggle money investments. Almost as fun...\n\nI truly believe the one big positive from the Gamestop shitstorm was showing a large group of individuals organising and speaking as one makes an impact and can compete with the Goliath institutional investors. Below is more detailed rationale my votes. Proposals #2 and #3 are dependent on Proposal #1 passing (ie: if Proposal #1 to change the classification doesn't pass, the other two proposals don't matter regardless of how folks vote on them). If you voted already, don't worry - you can still amend your vote before October 23.\n\n\n\n**TLDR: Invesco has the most to gain if Proposal 1 passes while we shareholders have a 2bps fee reduction to gain. I voted \"For\" on Proposal 1, voted individually on Trustees on Proposal 2, and voted \"Against\" for Proposal 3 to send a message to Invesco: Come back with a better deal for your shareholders if you want us to sign on. You clearly spent millions on outreaching us, obviously you want this deal. Don't insult us with 2bps chump change.**\n\n\n\n**Voted \"For\" Proposal 1:** Changing QQQ's classification from a unit investment trust (“UIT”) to an open-end management investment company. Pro: Would reduce fees by 2bps. Con: Like others have already pointed out, why not more?  \nI voted \"**For**\" on this because it would ultimately benefit us. But looking at the other large open-end large ETS their fees range from 3 to 9bps (exception being Russell's IWF at 18bps), so wtf is Invesco doing wasting our time and killing all these trees to come to us with a pitiful 2bps reduction to 18?! Seriously, I almost voted \"\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-10T14:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-10T14:00Z'.
