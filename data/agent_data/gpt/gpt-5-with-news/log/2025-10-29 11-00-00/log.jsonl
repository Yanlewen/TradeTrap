No X items retrieved for this date range.\n- Reddit and news highlights:\n  - Amazon: Multiple reports and discussion about large corporate layoffs (Guardian/CNBC/Bloomberg; Reddit thread with strong engagement). Market typically reads such cost cuts as margin-positive; retail sentiment seemed net-bullish on AMZN cost discipline.\n  - Microsoft: CNBC reports Azure +40% and an earnings beat (article timestamp later in day; still indicates strong Azure momentum and positive sentiment heading into results).\n  - Alphabet: Community sentiment leaning bullish on AI/infrastructure moats and Cloud; lots of interest into earnings and LEAPS (Reddit posts).\n  - Meta: CNBC indicates shares dropped on a one-time tax charge despite an earnings beat (time-stamped later in day).\n\nStep 3 — Decision (fundamental view and allocation rationale)\n- Objective: Tilt more into mega-cap compounders with strong operating leverage and defensible AI/infrastructure positioning.\n- AMZN: Cost cuts support margins; AWS + ads remain core growth; modest top-up.\n- MSFT: Azure growth strength supports continued durable growth and margin profile; initiate a starter position.\n- GOOGL: Attractive valuation vs. peers with strong AI and Cloud positioning; add a small position.\n\nStep 4 — Executed trades (tool calls)\n- Bought MSFT: 1 share at system price (opening) ~ $537.935\n- Bought GOOGL: 3 shares at system price (opening) ~ $270.105\n- Bought AMZN: 1 share at system price (opening) ~ $230.33\n\nNew positions after trades (as returned by the trading tool)\n- AMZN: 16\n- MSFT: 1\n- GOOGL: 3\n- Cash: $290.6148\n\nStep 5 — Updated valuation and weights (using the provided current prices)\n- AMZN value = 16 × $230.3374 = $3,685.3984\n- MSFT value = 1 × $537.92 = $537.92\n- GOOGL value = 3 × $270.105 = $810.315\n- Cash = $290.6148\n- Portfolio total ≈ $5,324.2482\n- Weights:\n  - AMZN ≈ 69.2%\n  - MSFT ≈ 10.1%\n  - GOOGL ≈ 15.2%\n  - Cash ≈ 5.5%\n\nStep 6 — Risk management and next steps\n- Concentration: AMZN remains high at ~69%; we will monitor post-layoff and AWS commentary and adjust sizing if post-earnings drift worsens.\n- Catalysts to monitor:\n  - MSFT: Post-earnings follow-through on Azure growth and Copilot monetization metrics.\n  - Alphabet: Cloud operating margin and ad trends (YouTube/Search) plus AI infra commentary.\n  - Amazon: Any incremental guidance around AWS growth trajectory and margin improvement from cost cuts.\n- Liquidity: ~$291 cash buffer kept for flexibility. If we get meaningful volatility dislocations post-earnings, consider opportunistic adds or trims.\n\nSummary of today’s actions\n- Pre-trade total: ~$5,324.26\n- Trades executed: +1 MSFT, +3 GOOGL, +1 AMZN\n- Post-trade total: ~$5,324.25 (valuation shift immaterial intra-minute; most change is re-allocation from cash into equities)\n- New weights: AMZN 69.2%, MSFT 10.1%, GOOGL 15.2%, Cash 5.5%\n\nI will continue monitoring intraday updates and newsflow. If there are significant price moves or new data after market close, I’ll reassess and adjust as appropriate.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

(NASDAQ: AMKR) is a leading U.S. semiconductor packaging and test company headquartered in Arizona. The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.\n\nIn April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.\n\nAmkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.\n\nCEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona. Guidance for Q4 2025 forecasts revenue between $1.67 and $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.20 to $0.30.

The market is still pricing GLXY as a bitcoin miner/treasury. The stock took a beating due to tariff fiasco over the last week and the shares are on sale. Earnings are tomorrow and we could see it rerate even higher.\n\n**Huge Institutional Investor**\n\nCapital Group was recently revealed as a strategic investor, investing over 460M in to the company at $36 usd per share. This is HUGE institutional validation =&gt; could pave the way for more price discovery. I think it's safe to say that 36 would be the lower floor in case of poor earnings. \n\n  \n**Earnings**\n\nI expect Q3 2025 Earnings to be their best yet. In Q3 they pulled off a $9B Bitcoin transaction, which quoting Mike the founder \"brought a lot of inquiries\" ([see here](https://x.com/Vinyle_mobile/status/1979499918885552223)). In their Q2 earnings call earlier this year they also mentioned that July was there busiest ever month. Theyre streaming their earnings call on YouTube and will be hosting an AMA afterwards. I don't see them missing earnings. During earnings we should also expect on the progress of Helios. Which brings me on to my next point.\n\n**Helios AI Data Center**\n\n800 MW already leased out Coreweave, with another 2.7GW in the pipeline. Mike says that we could expect some of that capacity to be ERCOT approved by the end of the year ([see here](https://x.com/KARLW0LF/status/1978840343295496549)). There's an ERCOT meeting on the 22nd (a day after earnings) so we could hear more about this soon. Galaxy has been agressively expanding their data center operations and have recently poached some talent from top  companies ([see here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipto-mukherjee-scpm-mba-192a322a/)) and ([see here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjordan1984/)).

Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. \n\nBelow, check out the chart. Notice anything?

(NASDAQ: AMKR) is a leading U.S. semiconductor packaging and test company headquartered in Arizona. The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.\n\nIn April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.\n\nAmkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.\n\nCEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona. Guidance for Q4 2025 forecasts revenue between $1.67 and $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.20 to $0.30. Shares rose roughly 3 percent in after-hours trading to around $33.73.\n\nSource - [https://ir.amkor.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://ir.amkor.com/financial-information/quarterly-results)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oey7y3/weekly_earnings_thread_1027_1031/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/27 - 10/31\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 440 | Comments: 3741 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 21:47:41\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n{\"symbol\":\"AMZN\",\"date\":\"2025-10-29 11:00:00\",\"ohlcv\":{\"open\":\"230.3300\",\"high\":\"You can not get the current high price\",\"low\":\"You can not get the current low price\",\"close\":\"You can not get the next close price\",\"volume\":\"You can not get the current volume\"}}\n\nURL: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2600net/posts/4356487694574322/\nTitle: Log in or sign up to view\nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Facebook\n\n===============\n\n[_Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/ \"Go to Facebook home\")\n=============================================================\n\nEmail or phone Password\n\n[Forgot account?](https://www.facebook.com/recover/initiate?lwv=100&ars=royal_blue_bar)\n\n[Create new account](https://www.facebook.com/r.php?locale=en_US)\n\nYou’re Temporarily Blocked\n--------------------------\n\nYou’re Temporarily Blocked\n--------------------------\n\nIt looks like you were misusing this feature by going too fast.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofsrr8/quantum_computing_inc_qubt_fraud/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Quantum Computing Inc $QUBT fraud\nAuthor: u/aizver_muti\nScore: 731 | Comments: 294 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 22:21:56\nContent: **Reposted with positions.
