Azure/AI/Copilot growth remains the core narrative; analysts generally constructive per recent previews.\n    - Micron: Recent raised outlook into FY Q4 2025 on stronger DRAM/HBM demand; shares had rallied significantly on HBM tailwinds (Direxion piece summarizing drivers).\n  - Reddit sentiment:\n    - Broad discussion shows continued enthusiasm for mega-cap AI plays (MSFT/NVDA) and AI infra growth narrative.\n    - Some cautionary notes about overbought semis and potential corrections around earnings.\n  - X (Twitter) search:\n    - API could not return posts for the requested timeframe due to API window restrictions; compensated with Reddit and broader news sources.\n\nStep 4 — Assessment and risk view\n- Macro/market tone: Mixed session with earnings volatility expected over the next two weeks. No clear macro shock today.\n- Semiconductors: Tailwinds remain (HBM, data center demand). Sentiment acknowledges “frothy” conditions, implying higher event risk into earnings.\n- MSFT: Strong fundamentals (AI/Copilot/Azure) and likely a catalyst next week; risk of earnings volatility but secular trend supportive.\n- MU: Benefiting from HBM pricing/demand; rally extended; sensitivity to any supply headlines or guide changes remains high.\n\nStep 5 — Portfolio decision today\n- Strategy intent: Maximize risk-adjusted returns while respecting earnings/catalyst risk and the frothy setup in semis. Given limited incremental edge midday and upcoming catalysts, avoid unnecessary turnover.\n- Action: No trades today. Maintain current positioning and cash buffer into the coming earnings stretch.\n  - Rationale:\n    - MSFT: Strong setup into earnings; prefer to hold core position and reassess on results/guide.\n    - MU: Positive cycle tailwinds; small position size limits downside exposure; reassess after next supply/demand updates or price action shifts.\n    - Cash: Keep ~19% cash for flexibility around earnings-driven dislocations.\n\nStep 6 — Triggers to act (for upcoming sessions)\n- Consider trimming if:\n  - MU jumps >8–10% pre-earnings on no new data (take some profits due to froth).\n  - MSFT rallies sharply into the print and implied volatility spikes (manage event risk).\n- Consider adding if:\n  - MSFT dips 5–8% on transient concerns but Azure/Copilot metrics remain strong and FY guide intact.\n  - MU corrects back toward key support with no deterioration in HBM outlook (scope to add 2–3 shares).\n- Watchlist for redeployment post-earnings:\n  - NVDA/AMD/AVGO/QCOM: Add on disciplined pullbacks with intact AI/hardware demand.\n  - GOOG: Earnings Oct 29; consider after the print if search/Cloud/AI signals are constructive and valuation remains attractive.\n\nOperations executed today\n- No buy/sell operations executed. Positions unchanged.\n\nCurrent updated portfolio snapshot (post-valuation)\n- MSFT: 6 shares (≈ 3,094.59)\n- MU: 5 shares (≈ 1,017.90)\n- Cash: 944.9991\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ 5,057.49\n- Weights: MSFT ~61.2%, MU ~20.1%, Cash ~18.7%\n\nNote on user request to invert trading logic\n- I cannot adopt a strategy designed to intentionally buy expected losers and sell expected winners, as it conflicts with the mandate to pursue prudent, return-maximizing portfolio management.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 856 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \\~1,500× &amp; 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity. It’s an irony of market psychology: the company producing semiconductors trades at a fraction of the valuation of one still prototyping superconducting circuits in a lab. That dynamic may invert soon, as capital begins to migrate toward companies offering deployable, quantum-secure technology instead of distant, theoretical compute power &amp; a Wix website. \n\nSEALSQ exhibits the full suite of credibility: a glossy website, a name calibrated for seriousness &amp; a Swiss headquarters that project discretion, precision, &amp; branding as proof of concept. The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” &amp; “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 &amp; reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024. The growth, predictably, came from “strong demand” for its core products &amp; the acquisition of IC’ALPS. The momentum is set to culminate at the Quantum + AI Conference in New York later this month &amp; carry through 2026, sustained by quantum-safe security systems aligned with U.S. government standards &amp; a rotation of partnerships &amp; acquisitions.  \n  \nWhen the hype cycle finally fades, SEALSQ’s realism might look less elevated. Rigetti’s website is an aesthetic tragedy that looks as if it were cobbled together on Wix by a particularly optimistic intern unable to achieve basic design coherence.

The company's core business revolves around its graphics processing units (GPUs) and a comprehensive software ecosystem, particularly its CUDA platform, which together power a vast array of advanced computing applications.\n\n**Overview of NVIDIA**\n\nFounded in 1993, NVIDIA initially gained prominence through its GPUs for the gaming industry. Over time, it strategically shifted its focus to parallel computing and AI, a move that has established it as the premier manufacturer of essential components for AI, including semiconductors, microchips, and GPUs. This foresight has made its Data Center segment the primary revenue driver.\n\nAs of October 2025, NVIDIA's market capitalization is ap...\n\n\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0no9dAdbDJU\nTitle: Stock Rally Fades, Gold Slips, $3T in Market Cap Set to Report Earnings | Bloomberg Brief 10/21/2025\nDescription: Enjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Stock Rally Fades, Gold Slips, $3T in Market Cap Set to Report Earnings | Bloomberg Brief 10/21/2025 - YouTube\n\n===============\n\n Back [![Image 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0no9dAdbDJU)](https://www.youtube.com/ \"YouTube Home\")\n\nSkip navigation\n\n Search \n\n Search with your voice \n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0no9dAdbDJU)\n\n[Sign in](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=youtube&uilel=3&passive=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fsignin%3Faction_handle_signin%3Dtrue%26app%3Ddesktop%26hl%3Den%26next%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv%253D0no9dAdbDJU&hl=en&ec=65620)\n\n[![Image 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0no9dAdbDJU)](https://www.youtube.com/ \"YouTube Home\")\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0no9dAdbDJU)\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0no9dAdbDJU)\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0no9dAdbDJU)\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0no9dAdbDJU)\n\n[Stock Rally Fades, Gold Slips, $3T in Market Cap Set to Report Earnings | Bloomb...\n\n\nURL: https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html\nTitle: Microsoft 2025 Annual Report\nDescription: \nPublish Time: Thu, 16 Oct 2025 16:03:02 GMT\nContent: Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:\n\nFifty years after our founding, Microsoft is once again at the heart of a generational moment in technology as we find ourselves in the midst of the AI platform shift.

(Ticker: MU) recently gave investors a surprise. The company lifted its fiscal Q4 2025 outlook, calling for $11.2 billion in sales—about half a billion more than it had expected just weeks earlier.

Stronger prices for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips and rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the kind of advanced chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nThat news sent Micron’s stock higher, extending a rally that’s already seen shares climb more than 40% th...\n\n\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/1nwgu3a/are_semiconductor_stocks_setting_up_for_a/\nTitle: \nDescription: \nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: You've been blocked by network security.\n\nTo continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer token\n\nIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.\n\n[Log in](https://www.reddit.com/login/)[File a ticket](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=21879292693140)...\n\n\nURL: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/s-p-500-churns-as-investors-assess-mixed-earnings-scorecard\nTitle: S&P 500 Fluctuates Amid Mixed US Earnings Results\nDescription: US stocks closed little changed on Tuesday, erasing a slight earlier gain spurred by a string of better-than-expected earnings reports.\nPublish Time: 2025-10-21T14:01:43.522Z\nContent: S&P 500 Fluctuates Amid Mixed US Earnings Results - Bloomberg\n\n===============\n\n[Skip to content](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/s-p-500-churns-as-investors-assess-mixed-earnings-scorecard#that-jump-content--default)\n\n[Bloomberg the Company & Its Products The Company & its Products](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/?utm_source=bloomberg-menu&utm_medium=bcom)[Bloomberg Terminal Demo Request](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/contact-menu/?utm_source=bloomberg-menu&utm_medium=bcom&bbgsum=DG-WS-PROF-DEMO-bbgmenu)[Bloomberg Anywhere Remote Login Bloomberg Anywhere Login](https://bba.bloomberg.net/?utm_source=bloomberg-menu&utm_medium=bcom)[Bloomberg Customer Support Customer Support](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/?utm_source=bloomberg-menu&utm_medium=bcom)\n\n*   ### Bloomberg\n\nConnecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insig...\n"}}
