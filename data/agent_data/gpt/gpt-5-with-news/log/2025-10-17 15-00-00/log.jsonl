I retried with broader queries; still blocked by the same time-window constraint. I proceeded with Reddit and general web sources.\n- Key items gathered:\n  - Reddit (r/stocks): “Senate passes bill limiting Nvidia and AMD AI chip exports to China” (linking to Yahoo Finance). Headwind for NVDA/AMD near to mid-term, prioritizing US customers and curbing China exposure. This can weigh on demand/mix and near-term sales in China-limited SKUs.\n  - Web (Proactive Investors, Aug 11): Micron (MU) raised fiscal Q4 guidance on stronger DRAM pricing and HBM demand; guided to higher revenue and GM, reinforcing AI-memory tailwinds.\n  - Microsoft Investor Relations: FY25 Q1 Performance page is live, indicating results are posted; Azure/Copilot adoption trends continue to underpin fundamentals (no negative surprises surfaced in my scan).\n  - Reddit (ASML post, r/stocks): China demand expected to soften into 2026; broader semis export headwinds remain a theme (indirectly relevant to NVDA supply/demand to China).\n- Synthesis:\n  - NVDA: Regulatory/China headwinds raising incremental risk to certain geographies/segments despite strong AI cycle. Risk skew: near-term headline risk persists.\n  - MU: Structural tailwind from AI memory (HBM/DRAM pricing) with improved margin outlook; trend remains supportive.\n  - MSFT: Execution steady; AI monetization drivers (Copilot) and Azure remain solid pillars; no material negative updates flagged in the feeds scanned.\n  - INTC: Earnings within a week (Oct 23 per reporting); still a turnaround story; risk/reward mixed ahead of print.\n\nStep 3 — Portfolio valuation before trades\n- NVDA: 10 x 183.4799 = 1,834.799\n- MSFT: 5 x 514.341 = 2,571.705\n- MU: 3 x 201.83 = 605.49\n- INTC: 1 x 37.185 = 37.185\n- Cash: 0.9941\n- Total pre-trade value ≈ 5,050.1731\n\n- Pre-trade weights (approx):\n  - MSFT: 50.94%\n  - NVDA: 36.35%\n  - MU: 11.99%\n  - INTC: 0.74%\n  - Cash: 0.02%\n\nStep 4 — Reallocation logic and actions\n- Rationale:\n  - Reduce NVDA weight to mitigate regulatory/China-exposure headline risk.\n  - Increase exposure to stronger fundamental momentum and clarity: MSFT (execution/AI monetization) and MU (HBM/DRAM pricing strength).\n  - Maintain a toe-hold in INTC ahead of the earnings print; avoid taking event risk in size.\n\n- Executed trades (via tools):\n  - Sold NVDA: 5 shares\n  - Bought MSFT: 1 share\n  - Bought MU: 2 shares\n\nStep 5 — Updated positions and portfolio valuation after trades\n- Updated positions:\n  - NVDA: 5\n  - MSFT: 6\n  - MU: 5\n  - INTC: 1\n  - Cash: 0.3641\n\n- Valuation at current prices:\n  - NVDA: 5 x 183.4799 = 917.3995\n  - MSFT: 6 x 514.341 = 3,086.046\n  - MU: 5 x 201.83 = 1,009.15\n  - INTC: 1 x 37.185 = 37.185\n  - Cash: 0.3641\n  - Total post-trade value ≈ 5,050.1446\n\n- Post-trade weights (approx):\n  - MSFT: 61.14%\n  - MU: 19.99%\n  - NVDA: 18.17%\n  - INTC: 0.74%\n  - Cash: ~0.01%\n\nStep 6 — What changed and why\n- We rotated away from concentrated NVDA risk into diversified AI beneficiaries:\n  - NVDA: Reduced to ~18% weight due to incremental policy headwinds (China export/priority constraints). Still maintain exposure to AI cycle, but de-risked.\n  - MSFT: Increased to ~61% as a compounder with robust AI monetization (Copilot) and Azure strength; defensive in AI stack relative to single-product cycle sensitivity.\n  - MU: Increased to ~20% leveraging secular AI memory demand and improved pricing/margins; complements MSFT exposure with a component-level AI lever not directly tied to GPU export headlines.\n  - INTC: Left minimal size ahead of an earnings catalyst; retain optionality while limiting downside if turnaround commentary/margins disappoint.\n\nStep 7 — Monitoring and next steps\n- Catalysts to watch:\n  - INTC earnings (expected Oct 23): watch Foundry update, Gaudi traction, margin trajectory.\n  - Any US-China export policy developments impacting AI hardware; watch for implications to NVDA and broader AI supply chain.\n  - MU demand/pricing checks for HBM/DRAM into CYQ4/CYQ1.\n  - MSFT Azure growth/Copilot monetization cadence from management commentary and sell-side revisions.\n- Triggers:\n  - If policy pressure on NVDA escalates or China mix deteriorates beyond expectations, consider trimming further and/or hedging.\n  - If INTC outlook weakens on print, consider exiting the small placeholder.\n  - If MU’s pricing momentum sustains into the next update, consider incremental adds if cash is available.\n  - Maintain MSFT as core due to balanced growth/AI monetization profile.\n\nFinal updated positions (as of 2025-10-17 15:00:00):\n- NVDA: 5\n- MSFT: 6\n- MU: 5\n- INTC: 1\n- CASH: 0.3641\n\nI attempted X searches as required, but the API blocked the time window; I incorporated Reddit and web sources to inform today’s decisions. I will continue to monitor for any late-day headlines and adjust if necessary.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Management called out higher ARPU from users moving into the Max tier that bundles advanced AI features. That uptier is already visible in Q2 commentary and coverage.\n\n3.

Daily active users grew about 40 percent and paid subscribers were up more than 35 percent to roughly 11 million exiting Q2.\n2. Mix is improving.
