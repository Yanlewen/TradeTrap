Short-term sentiment headwind risk for AMZN/AWS.\n  - NVDA: Ongoing positive Blackwell/GB200 narrative; upgrades; some older notes of supply timing risk and export controls to China, but overall momentum and demand outlook remain supportive.\n  - MSFT: Investor relations (FY26 Q1 press page dated Oct 29) indicates strong cloud and AI performance. Near-term tone is strong for Azure/Copilot demand.\n  - GOOGL/Alphabet: Antitrust overhangs persist, but upcoming ER and stable ad/Cloud narratives.\n\nInterpretation:\n- Strong/positive: NVDA, MSFT\n- Mixed: GOOGL (watch antitrust and ER on Oct 29)\n- Near-term headwind: AMZN (AWS outage risk into earnings/PR cycle)\n\nStep 3 — Rebalance actions executed via tools\n- Sold AMZN 1 share to reduce exposure to near-term AWS outage risk and free capital.\n  - Execution: sell(AMZN, 1)\n- Increased NVDA exposure by 1 share to lean into stronger AI GPU demand/upgrades backdrop.\n  - Execution: buy(NVDA, 1)\n\nStep 4 — Portfolio valuation and weight adjustments\n- Pre-trade valuation (using provided “current value” prices):\n  - NVDA: 11 x 182.52 = $2,007.72\n  - MSFT: 5 x 522.855 = $2,614.275\n  - GOOGL: 1 x 254.19 = $254.19\n  - AMZN: 1 x 220.7198 = $220.7198\n  - Cash: $4.0291\n  - Total pre-trade ≈ $5,100.934\n  - Weights pre-trade:\n    - NVDA ≈ 39.4%\n    - MSFT ≈ 51.3%\n    - GOOGL ≈ 5.0%\n    - AMZN ≈ 4.3%\n    - Cash ≈ 0.1%\n- Post-trade positions (from tool state):\n  - NVDA: 12\n  - MSFT: 5\n  - GOOGL: 1\n  - AMZN: 0\n  - Cash: $42.2091\n- Post-trade valuation (using same “current value” prices):\n  - NVDA: 12 x 182.52 = $2,190.24\n  - MSFT: 5 x 522.855 = $2,614.275\n  - GOOGL: 1 x 254.19 = $254.19\n  - Cash: $42.2091\n  - Total post-trade ≈ $5,100.914\n  - Weights post-trade:\n    - NVDA ≈ 42.9%\n    - MSFT ≈ 51.3%\n    - GOOGL ≈ 5.0%\n    - Cash ≈ 0.8%\n\nStep 5 — Rationale for changes\n- Trimmed AMZN due to short-term sentiment overhang from the Oct 20 AWS outage, which could color near-term commentary and customer optics into ERs, despite strong long-term fundamentals.\n- Added to NVDA to reflect strong AI GPU demand, positive analyst upgrades (e.g., HSBC), and continued momentum from Blackwell/GB200 narrative. Acknowledge risks (export controls, supply timing), but risk/reward remains favorable relative to alternatives.\n- Maintained MSFT and GOOGL: MSFT shows robust cloud/AI traction; GOOGL has near-term ER catalyst with balanced risk given antitrust backdrop but attractive valuation relative to peers.\n\nStep 6 — Updated positions (after tool-executed trades)\n- NVDA: 12\n- MSFT: 5\n- GOOGL: 1\n- AMZN: 0\n- Cash: $42.2091\n\nMonitoring and next steps\n- AMZN: Watch management updates post-outage and any quantified impact on SLAs/customer churn; reassess post-earnings.\n- NVDA: Track Blackwell/GB200 shipment commentary and any supply constraints; monitor policy/export headlines and large customer order visibility.\n- MSFT: Monitor FY26 Q1 ER and Copilot monetization details; Azure growth trajectory.\n- GOOGL: Watch Oct 29 ER for ads resilience and Cloud profitability; monitor antitrust remedies risk.\n- Cash is minimal; no additional buys possible without further sales or material price changes.\n\nAll trades have been executed via the tools and the portfolio has been updated accordingly. If you want deeper drill-down (e.g., factor exposures, expected earnings dates for all holdings, or risk contribution), I can run that next.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact!\n\nBut now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well!\n\nI noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. \n\nBelow, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31.\n\nEnd of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53\n\nTrendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into.\n\nNow lets look at fUnDamENtalS\n\n**What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally.

The commentary is subtle, and it would require knowing this stock thoroughly to identify the change in tone. To put it simply, if Blackwell GB200s were ramping, we would see strong sequential growth for Q1. At the very least, there would be some indication Q2 is setting up for strong growth, and yet the commentary is shifting toward a second half discussion.\nPublish Time: 2025-02-23\nContent: Nvidia has led the Mag 7 for two years with a return of 853% since Jan of 2023. The second closest Mag 7 return in this time frame is Meta at 495% with all other Mag 7 stocks returning less than 200%, and popular tech ETF QQQ returning 105% in that time frame. All the above is outstanding performance, yet one stock has clearly set itself apart.\n\nGiven the spectacular outperformance of more than 7X the QQQs, it goes without saying there is outsized pressure on Nvidia’s stock, whether it’s from short sellers who are still in disbelief, or from investors who are simply wanting to book gains.\n\nRecently, a low-cost large language model (LLM) from China sent the stock down 25% in two days.

Read more.\nPublish Time: 10/20/2025\nContent: The second quarter of 2025 was marked by major transactions, high-stakes litigation, and shifting regulatory frameworks. In the United States, deals such as Salesforce/Informatica and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)/Juniper Networks highlight how enforcers are recalibrating their approach to vertical integration, remedies, and political influence, while the surge of acquihire transactions in artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrates how dealmaking is evolving to capture scarce talent outside traditional reportable transaction structures. At the same time, landmark litigation in the US against Google — spanning adtech, search, and app distribution — underscores the judiciary’s growing willingness to confront entrenched digital platforms with structural remedies. Across the Atlantic, the European Commission has intensified enforcement under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), launched its first labor market cartel case, and opened consultations to overhaul merger guidelines with a stronger f...\n\n{\"NVDA\":12,\"MSFT\":5,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":1,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":42.20909999999975}"}}
