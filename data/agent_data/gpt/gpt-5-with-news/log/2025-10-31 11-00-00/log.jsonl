Some post-earnings “sell the news” price slip was noted in discussion threads.\n  - Reddit signals: r/stocks thread “Microsoft reports earnings beat as Azure revenue climbs 40%.” Broadly positive sentiment on the fundamentals.\n  - X API window constraint prevented time-bounded tweet pulls today, but sentiment from Reddit is clearly constructive.\n\n- Alphabet (GOOGL)\n  - News: Topped $100B quarterly revenue for the first time; Cloud +34% YoY; Ads/YouTube solid beats per CNBC article summarized in Reddit threads. DOJ ad-tech remedies risk remains in background (hearing concluded, judge urging settlement) via antitrust digest.\n  - Reddit signals: Multiple bullish GOOGL posts (e.g., “GOOG/GOOGL is the true AI king”) with generally positive sentiment around AI, Cloud, and Waymo narratives.\n\n- Amazon (AMZN)\n  - News: Q3 FY2025: ~$180.2B revenue (+12% YoY), AWS re-accelerated to ~20% growth (fastest in 11 quarters), strong operating income.

Prefer to wait for a better entry on any pullback or for additional capital.\n- Continue to monitor DOJ remedies risk for Alphabet and capex/AI ROI trajectories for Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nNext steps and monitoring\n\n- Watch ongoing post-earnings drift into next week (often positive for quality beats).\n- Track DOJ remedies developments for Google’s ad-tech case.\n- Monitor AWS trajectory vs. Azure, and margin commentary in upcoming conferences/filings.\n- Reassess allocation if a material dip presents a high-conviction add in current holdings.\n\nCurrent portfolio snapshot after review (unchanged)\n- Total value: $5,528.43\n- MSFT: $1,041.88 (18.9%)\n- GOOGL: $1,964.90 (35.5%)\n- AMZN: $2,466.01 (44.6%)\n- Cash: $55.64 (1.0%)\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ohm7o7/nbis_earnings_dd_neius/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius)\nAuthor: u/JoeyVottoS\nScore: 129 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 02:22:41\nContent: TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025.\n\nPositions: 8k worth of call options  with most expiring 11/21. $100, $110, and $130 strikes are the main position.

(NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.\n\nToday, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.\n\nNebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc\n\nCurrent CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets.\n——————————————————————————\n\nEarnings preview\n\n[Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o91n07/weekly_earnings_thread_1020_1024/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/20 - 10/24\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 284 | Comments: 1844 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 21:41:02\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o30q4w/weekly_earnings_thread_1013_1017/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/13 - 10/17\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 198 | Comments: 970 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 21:20:15\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ochvdl/meta_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager\nAuthor: u/Quick_Increase6718\nScore: 21 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 61.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 00:38:15\nContent: My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following:\n\n1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e\n\n2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections.\n\n3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oey7y3/weekly_earnings_thread_1027_1031/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/27 - 10/31\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 450 | Comments: 3741 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 21:47:41\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5uw6e/will_amazon_ever_pay_dividends/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Will Amazon ever pay dividends?\nAuthor: u/blissfulfinance\nScore: 189 | Comments: 225 | Upvote Ratio: 85.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 04:15:58\nContent: I tried finding news articles or public statements, but only came across some mentions from early last year when Google and Meta announced their dividend programs.

Hindenburg detailed several inflated key metrics, unconfident management, and many instances of sexual abuse, grooming, and a lack of safety measures. If you don't know, Hindenburg is famous for their excellent and detailed short theses; they are known for for exposing companies such as Carvana, Nikola, Icahn Enterprises, Singularity Future Technology, and many more. They take on short positions in the companies before posting their reports, which often crash massively following the publication. The reports feature high-quality investigative journalism, talks with insiders, and investigations from third-party consultants. Unfortunately, Hindenberg Research shut down in January 2025, with their last report being on Carvana. This post will be built upon the original report, with new information since the publication, and my own perspectives and conclusions. I really recommend reading the original article, as it goes into much more detail than I will.\n\nSurprisingly, unlike most of their reports, it had little effect on the stock price. When the article was released, the stock was trading at $40; now it's trading at $132 - a 230% gain. This rally has been fueled by Roblox reporting tremendous growth. In Q2, they reported a 51% increase YoY in Robux spend, a 41% increase YoY in active users, and a 21% increase YoY in revenue. It is a seemingly amazing growth story, with Cathie Wood on board, holding about 1.4% of outstanding stock.
