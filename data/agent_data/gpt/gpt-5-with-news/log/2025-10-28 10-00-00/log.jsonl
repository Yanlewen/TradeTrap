Sentiment is cautiously bullish to positive for mega-cap tech heading into results, with particular optimism on AI themes. With our limited cash and earnings risk imminent, risk management suggests avoiding small, low-conviction adds before prints.\n\nStep 5: Trade decision\n- Constraints: Available cash ≈ $204 limits meaningful adds in our tracked large caps; small adds in low-priced names would not materially improve risk-adjusted return ahead of earnings.\n- Assessment: Given likely earnings reports for MSFT and GOOGL imminently and generally constructive sentiment for mega-cap tech, maintain current exposure into results to preserve potential upside. No rebalancing now avoids transaction slippage and premature de-risking.\n- Action: Hold positions; no trades today.\n\nStep 6: Next steps and monitoring plan\n- Monitor MSFT Q1 FY26 earnings (Azure growth rate, AI attach/CoPilot monetization, margin trajectory).\n- Monitor Alphabet Q3 earnings (Ads growth, Google Cloud profitability and growth, AI product updates).\n- Post-earnings plan:\n  - If MSFT/GOOGL deliver strong beats and guidance, consider increasing exposure on any reasonable post-earnings setups when sufficient cash is available (potentially via raising cash elsewhere or on pullbacks).\n  - If either disappoints (notably if Azure growth or Google Cloud trends underwhelm), reassess position sizing and risk.\n\nOperations executed today\n- No trades executed. Positions unchanged.\n\nUpdated portfolio snapshot (as of 2025-10-28 10:00:00)\n- MSFT: 5 shares (≈ $2,657.05)\n- GOOGL: 9 shares (≈ $2,423.43)\n- Cash: $204.13\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ $5,284.61\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oey7y3/weekly_earnings_thread_1027_1031/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/27 - 10/31\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 443 | Comments: 3741 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 21:47:41\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 864 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odj6m9/tesla_reports_revenue_growth_of_12_after_two_down/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Tesla reports revenue growth of 12% after two down quarters in a row\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 449 | Comments: 331 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 04:14:00\nContent: Tesla reported a 12% increase in third quarter revenue on Wednesday following two straight periods of declines.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ohfevt/qualcomm_announces_ai_chips_to_compete_with_amd/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Qualcomm announces AI chips to compete with AMD and Nvidia\nAuthor: u/Icy-Motor-8519\nScore: 375 | Comments: 79 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 22:09:28\nContent: Qualcomm announced Monday that it will release new artificial intelligence accelerator chips, marking new competition for Nvidia, which has so far dominated the market for AI semiconductors.\n\nThe AI chips are a shift from Qualcomm, which has thus far focused on semiconductors for wireless connectivity and mobile devices, not massive data centers.\n\nQualcomm announced that it will release new AI accelerator chips.\n\nNvidia has dominated the market for AI chips, with AMD seen as the second-place player.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft and OpenAI are also developing their own AI accelerators for their cloud services.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/10/27/qualcomm-ai200-ai250-ai-chips-nvidia-amd.html\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o90opl/moodys_says_the_banking_system_private_credit/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Moody’s says the banking system, private credit markets are sound despite worries over bad loans. \"One cockroach does not a trend make.\"\nAuthor: u/WickedSensitiveCrew\nScore: 349 | Comments: 105 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 21:01:30\nContent: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/17/moodys-says-the-banking-system-private-credit-markets-are-sound-despite-worries-over-bad-loans.html\n\n&gt; Despite worries over bad loans at midsize U.S. banks, there’s little evidence of a systemic problem, according to a senior analyst at Moody’s Ratings. Marc Pinto, the agency’s head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. “When we dig deeper here and look to see if there’s a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,” Pinto said. “Now that’s what we’re seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, we’re seeing very little deterioration at all.”\n\n&gt; Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank’s earnings conference call that “when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”\n\n&gt; “One cockroach does not a trend make,” Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oet760/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday Oct 24, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 12 | Comments: 293 | Upvote Ratio: 80.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 17:30:31\nContent: This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.
