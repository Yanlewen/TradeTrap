Positive for NVDA and MSFT AI infrastructure demand.\n- Micron (MU):\n  - UBS raised PT to $245; shares up ~3% on tight DRAM supply and AI/HBM demand (Invezz, 2025-10-16). Positive catalyst; supportive memory cycle dynamics.\n- Lam Research (LRCX):\n  - WFE outlook for 2025 is generally flattish to mid single-digit growth depending on vendor exposure (nomadsemi substack overview). Neutral to modestly positive; cyclical but supported by memory/HBM and logic nodes.\n- Intel (INTC):\n  - Panther Lake on 18A unveiled; Arizona Fab 52 operational; multiple Reddit threads and press suggest improving sentiment on execution and U.S.-based advanced node ramp. Near-term fundamentals still mixed, but news tone is constructive.\n\nStep 4 — Actions executed today\n- Bought 1 share MU at the day’s buy price (the system uses the day’s opening): 203.56\n  - Rationale: Positive sell-side catalyst (UBS upgrade), tight DRAM supply, AI-driven HBM demand—all supportive for revenue/margins into the current memory upcycle. Adds to semis exposure levered to AI memory.\n- No sells executed.\n\nExecution log (tool-recorded)\n- Buy MU 1 share\n  - New position returned by system: MU increased from 1 → 2; CASH updated accordingly.\n\nStep 5 — Updated valuation and weights after trade\n- Updated positions: NVDA 8, MSFT 5, MU 2, LRCX 3, INTC 1, CASH 142.6741\n- Updated holdings value:\n  - NVDA: 1,451.92\n  - MSFT: 2,565.90\n  - MU: 2 x 203.56 = 407.12\n  - LRCX: 426.42\n  - INTC: 37.1845\n  - Total holdings: 4,888.5445\n- Cash: 142.6741\n- Total portfolio value: 5,031.2186\n- Approximate weights:\n  - MSFT ~51.0%\n  - NVDA ~28.9%\n  - LRCX ~8.5%\n  - MU ~8.1%\n  - INTC ~0.7%\n  - Cash ~2.8%\n\nStep 6 — Plan and risk notes\n- Semiconductors/AI remain the core thesis: Strong AI infra (NVDA/MSFT), improving memory cycle (MU), and steady WFE (LRCX) support the current positioning.\n- Watch items:\n  - Macro rates and yields (a spike can compress multiples).\n  - Export controls/supply-chain restrictions impacting AI supply.\n  - Earnings dates/guidance for NVDA/MSFT/MU/LRCX/INTC over the next few weeks.\n- Near-term moves: With limited cash remaining, I prefer to hold cash buffer unless we see a high-conviction volatility-driven opportunity or fresh catalysts.\n\nNote on user request to “invert trading logic”: My mandate is to maximize returns through sound fundamental analysis. I will not adopt a strategy that purposefully buys expected losers or sells expected winners.\n\nCurrent positions (after today’s trade)\n{\"NVDA\": 8, \"MSFT\": 5, \"AAPL\": 0, \"GOOG\": 0, \"GOOGL\": 0, \"AMZN\": 0, \"META\": 0, \"AVGO\": 0, \"TSLA\": 0, \"NFLX\": 0, \"PLTR\": 0, \"COST\": 0, \"ASML\": 0, \"AMD\": 0, \"CSCO\": 0, \"AZN\": 0, \"TMUS\": 0, \"MU\": 2, \"LIN\": 0, \"PEP\": 0, \"SHOP\": 0, \"APP\": 0, \"INTU\": 0, \"AMAT\": 0, \"LRCX\": 3, \"PDD\": 0, \"QCOM\": 0, \"ARM\": 0, \"INTC\": 1, \"BKNG\": 0, \"AMGN\": 0, \"TXN\": 0, \"ISRG\": 0, \"GILD\": 0, \"KLAC\": 0, \"PANW\": 0, \"ADBE\": 0, \"HON\": 0, \"CRWD\": 0, \"CEG\": 0, \"ADI\": 0, \"ADP\": 0, \"DASH\": 0, \"CMCSA\": 0, \"VRTX\": 0, \"MELI\": 0, \"SBUX\": 0, \"CDNS\": 0, \"ORLY\": 0, \"SNPS\": 0, \"MSTR\": 0, \"MDLZ\": 0, \"ABNB\": 0, \"MRVL\": 0, \"CTAS\": 0, \"TRI\": 0, \"MAR\": 0, \"MNST\": 0, \"CSX\": 0, \"ADSK\": 0, \"PYPL\": 0, \"FTNT\": 0, \"AEP\": 0, \"WDAY\": 0, \"REGN\": 0, \"ROP\": 0, \"NXPI\": 0, \"DDOG\": 0, \"AXON\": 0, \"ROST\": 0, \"IDXX\": 0, \"EA\": 0, \"PCAR\": 0, \"FAST\": 0, \"EXC\": 0, \"TTWO\": 0, \"XEL\": 0, \"ZS\": 0, \"PAYX\": 0, \"WBD\": 0, \"BKR\": 0, \"CPRT\": 0, \"CCEP\": 0, \"FANG\": 0, \"TEAM\": 0, \"CHTR\": 0, \"KDP\": 0, \"MCHP\": 0, \"GEHC\": 0, \"VRSK\": 0, \"CTSH\": 0, \"CSGP\": 0, \"KHC\": 0, \"ODFL\": 0, \"DXCM\": 0, \"TTD\": 0, \"ON\": 0, \"BIIB\": 0, \"LULU\": 0, \"CDW\": 0, \"GFS\": 0, \"CASH\": 142.6741}\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Both personal income and spending accelerated more than expected in August, shortly after unemployment claims showed an improvement in the labor backdrop halfway through September. Meanwhile, headline and core PCE price indices continued to indicate inflationary pressures in the economy. Rate futures continued to reflect expectations that the FOMC will deliver a second consecutive rate cut in October, but evidence of resilience in spending and some respite for the labor market drove markets to pare positions corresponding to a December cut. Yields were also supported by the continuation of the Fed's quantitative tightening pace decided this month, despite the depletion of its overnight reverse repo facility.\nPublish Time: 2025-09-26T12:52:58Z\nContent: US Yields Hold Rebound \n\n===============\n\n[](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield/news/488307)\n*     \n\n[](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield/news/488307)\n\n[](https://tradingeconomics.com/)\n\n[Calendar](https://tradingeconomics.com/calendar)[News](https://tradingeconomics.com/stream)\n\n[Markets](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield/news/488307#)\n*   [Commodities](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodities)\n*   [Indexes](https://tradingeconomics.com/stocks)\n*   [Shares](https://tradingeconomics.com/shares)\n*   [Currencies](https://tradingeconomics.com/currencies)\n*   [Crypto](https://tradingeconomics.com/crypto)\n*   [Bonds](https://tradingeconomics.com/bonds)\n*   [Earnings](https://tradingeconomics.com/earnings)\n\n[Indicators](https://tradingeconomics.com/indicators)[Countries](https://tradingeconomics.com/countries)\n\n[Forecasts](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield/news/488307#)\n...\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-15T00:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-15T00:00Z'.

It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **\"Antifun\"** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&amp;P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**).\n\nAs a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume.

As Azure scales to its goal of deploying hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs, even more innovations are poised to emerge from customers like OpenAI.\"\n\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-azure-delivers-the-first-large-scale-cluster-with-nvidia-gb300-nvl72-for-openai-workloads/\n\n\"Microsoft delivers the first at-scale production cluster with more than 4,600 NVIDIA GB300 NVL72, featuring NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs connected through the next-generation NVIDIA InfiniBand network. This cluster is the first of many, as we scale to hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs deployed across Microsoft’s AI datacenters globally, reflecting our continued commitment to redefining AI infrastructure and collaboration with NVIDIA. The massive scale clusters with Blackwell Ultra GPUs will enable model training in weeks instead of months, delivering high throughput for inference workloads.\"\n\n\"This co-engineered system delivers the world’s first at-scale GB300 production cluster, providing the supercomputing engine needed for OpenAI to serve multitrillion-parameter models.
