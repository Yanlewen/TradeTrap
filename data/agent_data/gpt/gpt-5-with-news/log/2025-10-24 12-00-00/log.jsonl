It conflicts with the system strategy to maximize returns through fundamentals. I will proceed with disciplined, fundamentals- and news-driven portfolio management.\n\nStep 1 — Read yesterday’s positions and today’s prices\n- Positions at start of day (2025-10-24 12:00:00):\n  - NVDA: 4\n  - MSFT: 4\n  - GOOGL: 8\n  - Cash: 248.6141\n- Reference prices provided:\n  - NVDA_price: 185.325\n  - MSFT_price: 522.305\n  - GOOGL_price: 260.09\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation pre-trade (based on provided prices)\n- NVDA: 4 x 185.325 = 741.30\n- MSFT: 4 x 522.305 = 2,089.22\n- GOOGL: 8 x 260.09 = 2,080.72\n- Cash: 248.61\n- Total pre-trade portfolio value ≈ 5,159.85\n\nWeights pre-trade\n- NVDA: 14.37%\n- MSFT: 40.51%\n- GOOGL: 40.34%\n- Cash: 4.82%\n\nStep 3 — Market/news/sentiment roundup (tools used)\n- Macro\n  - Nasdaq article indicates stocks supported by a favorable CPI report; risk-on tone in tech.\n- X (Twitter)\n  - API recent-search constrained; attempted but blocked by time-window limits.\n- Reddit (multiple subreddits)\n  - NVDA: Multiple positive posts, including HSBC upgrade to Buy with $320 target (~80% implied upside) and ongoing commentary that Blackwell GPUs are sold out across 2025 indicating robust demand.\n  - MSFT: Earnings slated Oct 29, 2025; narrative remains constructive around Azure/Copilot monetization; no new negative catalysts surfaced.\n  - GOOGL/Alphabet: Mixed-to-positive sentiment. Posts highlighting potential AI infrastructure cost advantages vs. Nvidia and a “Quantum Echoes” algorithm breakthrough (hype risk acknowledged). Antitrust remains a background headline risk but no acute negative update tied to today.\n\nInterpretation\n- Sentiment and fundamentals for NVDA/MSFT/GOOGL lean positive into earnings season and macro tailwind, favoring holding or adding selectively.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and trades executed (must use tools)\n- Action: Add to NVDA on strong AI datacenter demand and positive sentiment breadth.\n- Trade executed:\n  - Buy NVDA 1 share\n\nNew positions after trade\n- NVDA: 5\n- MSFT: 4\n- GOOGL: 8\n- Cash: 63.2941\n\nStep 5 — Post-trade valuation and weights (using provided prices)\n- NVDA: 5 x 185.325 = 926.625\n- MSFT: 2,089.22\n- GOOGL: 2,080.72\n- Cash: 63.2941\n- Total ≈ 5,159.86\n\nWeights post-trade\n- NVDA: 17.96%\n- MSFT: 40.49%\n- GOOGL: 40.34%\n- Cash: 1.23%\n\nStep 6 — Rationale\n- NVDA: Strengthening AI cycle signals (hyper-scaler demand, product sell-outs, bullish sell-side revisions) support additional exposure. Macro tone (benign CPI) adds to risk appetite.\n- MSFT: Approaching earnings with favorable Copilot/Azure narratives; hold.\n- GOOGL: Mixed but broadly constructive AI/value catalysts; hold. Note: monitor antitrust headline risk.\n- Cash: Kept minimal for now; if volatility rises around next week’s mega-cap earnings, we can raise cash via trims.\n\nStep 7 — Risk management and next actions\n- Key dates to monitor:\n  - MSFT earnings: Oct 29, 2025.\n  - Alphabet earnings window late Oct (monitor IR page/calendar).\n  - NVDA: Watch supply commentary, orderbook color, and datacenter cycle signals from peers (AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL).\n- Triggers to adjust:\n  - Any negative surprises on MSFT Azure growth/Copilot margins or GOOGL Search/Cloud trends may prompt a rebalance.\n  - If NVDA shows signs of order pushouts or ASP pressure, we will reassess NVDA sizing.\n- Information plan:\n  - Re-attempt X search closer to earnings (tool constraints noted today).\n  - Continue Reddit/news monitoring for incremental signals.\n\nCurrent portfolio snapshot (post-trade)\n- NVDA: 5\n- MSFT: 4\n- GOOGL: 8\n- Cash: 63.2941\n- Total value ≈ 5,159.86\n- Weights: NVDA 17.96%, MSFT 40.49%, GOOGL 40.34%, Cash 1.23%\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

I think the market is missing something here, and I would like to get the community’s thoughts on whether this is a fundamentally undervalued story or if there are risks I am not seeing?\n\nWhy I think StubHub deserves serious attention…\n\n1. Trading below its IPO price despite strong analyst coverage\n\nStubHub went public at $23.50 per share and has mostly traded below that level. That stands out because nearly every major investment bank has initiated coverage with Buy or Overweight ratings and price targets well above the IPO price. Goldman Sachs currently has one of the highest at $46 per share. Despite this, the stock has received very little discussion since the IPO.\n\n2. Dominant position in the ticket market\n\nStubHub controls around 50 percent of the U.S. secondary ticketing market, making it the clear leader in resale. The platform benefits from strong network effects where both buyers and sellers rely on its liquidity and brand trust. This dominant position provides a strong foundation as the company expands into primary ticketing, which is a much larger and more lucrative market.\n\n3. Expansion into direct ticket issuance\n\nStubHub has started winning major contracts to directly issue tickets for event organizers and venues. This marks an important shift from resale-only activity toward becoming a direct distribution partner. Competing in the primary ticketing space positions StubHub to capture a share of the broader live event ecosystem and strengthens its pricing power over time.\n\n4. Valuation case\n\nIf you apply a 20 times multiple to projected 2026 forward earnings, you arrive at a valuation close to $50 per share. That is a reasonable multiple for a market leader with strong brand equity, consistent growth, and expanding addressable markets. Even if earnings or margins come in below expectations, a fair value in the mid to high $30 rang\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oawxqp/fundamentals_dont_matter_in_predicting_bubble_pop/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Fundamentals Don’t Matter in Predicting Bubble Pop, Sentiment and Liquidity Do\nAuthor: u/MistahQuestionMan\nScore: 113 | Comments: 58 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-20 02:21:40\nContent: I keep seeing people go on and on about how the AI bubble is going to burst soon because the fundamentals are so stupid and it echoes so many elements of past popped bubbles. I think the mistake her is that it assumes a rational investor who gives a fuck about if the underlying company behind the stock makes sense. I personally feel the average investor retail or investor is just a dummy who invests based on what they think other people believe other people believe and how much easy stock-buying money that have access to at any given time. \n\nOnly two things I think matter now. One is Sentiment (and not even what an investor believes but what that investor believes other investors believe other investors believe. So even if a person thinks a company’s stock is stupid and overvalued, if they believe other people believe other people buy into the stock, they’ll do it too especially when FOMO and YOLO are high. \n\nTwo is liquidity: how much money do people have lying around to throw at half-baked dice rolls without having to liquidate another stock first? As long as people or institutions have disposable income in this climate of extra-stupid divorced from reality people they will just keep dip buying and riding out lows. \n\nA lot of popular sentiment, number one, flows from liquidity, number two. One people start running out of money and their personal finances are a mess and they need help to pay their bills and can’t just buy new stocks without liquidating old stocks and worse their old stocks are too in the toilet to even liquidate, then the sentiment will go into the toilet as they can’t just FOMO and YOLO and dip buy and ride out price drops at will anymore. \n\nThen and only then will fundamentals and bad news and earnings skepticism and giving a fuck about if company’s business model or stock price makes any sense.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9s1f6/google_can_build_ai_infrastructure_at_13rd_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odhh7m/everyones_chasing_nvdabut_google_just_dropped_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Everyone’s chasing NVDA，but Google just dropped the biggest AI news of the year\nAuthor: u/FingerStunning7106\nScore: 697 | Comments: 156 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 03:09:57\nContent: So this one really caught my eye today.\n\nGoogle says it’s developed a new quantum algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” that apparently runs 13,000 times faster on their quantum chip than the most advanced classical algorithms on a supercomputer.\n\nIt’s not just some “look how cool our tech is” moment either.\n\nThey’re saying it could help map molecular structures for drug discovery and design new materials ，which, if true, would make this one of the first real-world quantum computing applications we’ve seen so far.\n\nI still remember when they announced the “Willow” chip last year, claiming it solved a key qubit issue. This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI.

Morgan’s latest research puts gold’s average price at ~$5,055 per ounce by the end of Q4 2026, based on strong central bank and investor demand and the expectation of a Fed rate-cutting cycle. (They also signal a ~$6,000/oz target by 2028.)\n\nIf you run the numbers, showing gold as a $60 Trillion+ asset class isn’t totally crazy if usage, reserves and allocations expand. Why should we care? Because this suggests: 1 Gold isn’t just a hedge anymore, it could become a major macro asset. 2 Central banks are still buying and shifting allocations, which means structural demand. 3 If inflation, currency debasement or policy risks show up, the “safe-haven” narrative could get a big boost.\n\nIt depends on the right economic/monetary conditions lining up: Fed cuts, weak dollar, rising geopolitical risk, etc.\n\nWhat do you folks think? Does this target seem believable in the next 18-24 months? Or is this a hype scenario? Will gold really become one of the dominant global asset classes?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o809mm/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Daily General Discussion and Advice Thread - October 16, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 5 | Comments: 42 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 16:01:08\nContent: Have a general question?

Last purchase was 2007. 18 years ago.\n\n**Countries are pulling their gold back home**\n\nGermany, Netherlands, Austria, Hungary, Turkey all moved their gold out of NY and London vaults. Romania just voted to bring back 95% from Bank of England.\n\nThat's not normal.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1obfgkw/rddt_earnings_dd/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: RDDT Earnings DD\nAuthor: u/slocs1\nScore: 133 | Comments: 78 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-20 17:28:57\nContent: Hi all, I think RDDT will have great earnings.\n\nRDDT was beaten down from 280 to 190 by shorts in the last weeks and as there were no news at all they won.

Marc Pinto, the agency’s head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. “When we dig deeper here and look to see if there’s a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,” Pinto said. “Now that’s what we’re seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we’ve seen over the last several quarters, we’re seeing very little deterioration at all.”\n\n&gt; Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank’s earnings conference call that “when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”\n\n&gt; “One cockroach does not a trend make,” Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.
