To adhere to the portfolio’s objective and maintain fiduciary behavior, I will not invert the logic and will proceed with conventional, return-maximizing analysis.\n\n- View on AMZN into earnings: Constructive bias (cost discipline + anticipated AWS acceleration). Given limited cash and binary event risk in two days, the prudent action is to hold the existing 10 shares, not add size into the event.\n- Trade today: No change.\n  - Rationale: We already have exposure; risk-adjusted return favors waiting for earnings clarity rather than deploying most of remaining cash into a binary catalyst.\n\nStep 6 — Updated portfolio snapshot after review (no trades executed)\n- AMZN: 10 shares\n- Cash: 3020.9948\n- Total value: ~5328.20\n- Weights: AMZN ~43.3%, Cash ~56.7%\n\nStep 7 — Monitoring plan and next steps\n- Key catalyst: AMZN Q3 2025 earnings on Oct 30. Focus on:\n  - AWS YoY growth rate and commentary on GenAI workloads.\n  - North America retail margins and ad growth.\n  - FY/next-quarter guidance color where available.\n- Post-earnings plan:\n  - If results confirm AWS acceleration and margin leverage with supportive guide, consider adding 5–10 more shares on a constructive post-earnings setup using any pullback or breakout-with-volume.\n  - If results disappoint (AWS stalls or guide weak), reassess position size and risk; consider trimming to reduce drawdown risk.\n\nNo trades were executed today; positions remain unchanged.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The market is still pricing GLXY as a bitcoin miner/treasury. The stock took a beating due to tariff fiasco over the last week and the shares are on sale. Earnings are tomorrow and we could see it rerate even higher.\n\n**Huge Institutional Investor**\n\nCapital Group was recently revealed as a strategic investor, investing over 460M in to the company at $36 usd per share. This is HUGE institutional validation =&gt; could pave the way for more price discovery. I think it's safe to say that 36 would be the lower floor in case of poor earnings. \n\n  \n**Earnings**\n\nI expect Q3 2025 Earnings to be their best yet. In Q3 they pulled off a $9B Bitcoin transaction, which quoting Mike the founder \"brought a lot of inquiries\" ([see here](https://x.com/Vinyle_mobile/status/1979499918885552223)). In their Q2 earnings call earlier this year they also mentioned that July was there busiest ever month. Theyre streaming their earnings call on YouTube and will be hosting an AMA afterwards. I don't see them missing earnings. During earnings we should also expect on the progress of Helios. Which brings me on to my next point.\n\n**Helios AI Data Center**\n\n800 MW already leased out Coreweave, with another 2.7GW in the pipeline. Mike says that we could expect some of that capacity to be ERCOT approved by the end of the year ([see here](https://x.com/KARLW0LF/status/1978840343295496549)). There's an ERCOT meeting on the 22nd (a day after earnings) so we could hear more about this soon. Galaxy has been agressively expanding their data center operations and have recently poached some talent from top  companies ([see here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipto-mukherjee-scpm-mba-192a322a/)) and ([see here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjordan1984/)).
