My mandate is to maximize long-term returns. I will continue to use data-driven, fundamentals- and sentiment-aware analysis to guide trades toward that goal.\n\nStep 1 — Read inputs (positions and prices at 2025-10-28 15:00:00)\n- Starting positions:\n  - AMZN: 10 shares\n  - Cash: 3020.9948\n- Today’s quoted price used for AMZN: 230.36\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation and weights (pre-trade)\n- AMZN position value: 10 x 230.36 = 2303.60\n- Cash: 3020.9948\n- Portfolio total (pre-trade): 2303.60 + 3020.9948 = 5324.5948\n- Weights (pre-trade):\n  - AMZN: 43.3%\n  - Cash: 56.7%\n\nStep 3 — Gather market context and sentiment (tools used)\n- X (Twitter) search: API time-window limitations prevented fetching posts for the specific Oct 27–28 window.\n- Reddit sentiment and news:\n  - Amazon layoffs: ~30,000 corporate roles reduction announced today (Amazon newsroom). Market generally views cost reductions favorably for margins and free cash flow.\n  - Earnings timing: Amazon Q3 results are this week; sentiment threads show mixed but notable bullish retail expectations into earnings and cost-cut themes. Risk remains around AWS growth trajectory and retail margins, but layoffs imply renewed operating discipline.\n  - No contradictory red flags surfaced today beyond the typical earnings-event risk.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and execution\n- Rationale: With earnings imminent and a material internal cost-reduction action disclosed today, risk/reward for a modest add ahead of the event is acceptable given available cash and current single-name exposure. I sized prudently to manage earnings gap risk.\n- Operation executed:\n  - Bought AMZN 5 shares at today’s quoted price basis\n  - Tool call: buy(\"AMZN\", 5)\n\nStep 5 — Update valuation and weights (post-trade)\n- New positions:\n  - AMZN: 15 shares\n  - Cash: 1869.1948\n- AMZN position value: 15 x 230.36 = 3455.40\n- Portfolio total (post-trade): 3455.40 + 1869.1948 = 5324.5948\n- Weights (post-trade):\n  - AMZN: 64.9%\n  - Cash: 35.1%\n\nRisk management and next steps\n- Event risk: AMZN reports this week; volatility can be high. I sized the add modestly to allow flexibility after earnings.\n- Plan:\n  - Monitor AWS commentary, retail margin direction, and Q4 guide. If execution confirms margin progress and AWS stabilization/acceleration, consider adding on constructive guidance or post-print pullbacks.\n  - If earnings materially disappoint (AWS deceleration vs. expectations and/or weak margin outlook), reassess position size and risk controls promptly.\n\nCurrent positions (after today’s trades)\n{'NVDA': 0, 'MSFT': 0, 'AAPL': 0, 'GOOG': 0, 'GOOGL': 0, 'AMZN': 15, 'META': 0, 'AVGO': 0, 'TSLA': 0, 'NFLX': 0, 'PLTR': 0, 'COST': 0, 'ASML': 0, 'AMD': 0, 'CSCO': 0, 'AZN': 0, 'TMUS': 0, 'MU': 0, 'LIN': 0, 'PEP': 0, 'SHOP': 0, 'APP': 0, 'INTU': 0, 'AMAT': 0, 'LRCX': 0, 'PDD': 0, 'QCOM': 0, 'ARM': 0, 'INTC': 0, 'BKNG': 0, 'AMGN': 0, 'TXN': 0, 'ISRG': 0, 'GILD': 0, 'KLAC': 0, 'PANW': 0, 'ADBE': 0, 'HON': 0, 'CRWD': 0, 'CEG': 0, 'ADI': 0, 'ADP': 0, 'DASH': 0, 'CMCSA': 0, 'VRTX': 0, 'MELI': 0, 'SBUX': 0, 'CDNS': 0, 'ORLY': 0, 'SNPS': 0, 'MSTR': 0, 'MDLZ': 0, 'ABNB': 0, 'MRVL': 0, 'CTAS': 0, 'TRI': 0, 'MAR': 0, 'MNST': 0, 'CSX': 0, 'ADSK': 0, 'PYPL': 0, 'FTNT': 0, 'AEP': 0, 'WDAY': 0, 'REGN': 0, 'ROP': 0, 'NXPI': 0, 'DDOG': 0, 'AXON': 0, 'ROST': 0, 'IDXX': 0, 'EA': 0, 'PCAR': 0, 'FAST': 0, 'EXC': 0, 'TTWO': 0, 'XEL': 0, 'ZS': 0, 'PAYX': 0, 'WBD': 0, 'BKR': 0, 'CPRT': 0, 'CCEP': 0, 'FANG': 0, 'TEAM': 0, 'CHTR': 0, 'KDP': 0, 'MCHP': 0, 'GEHC': 0, 'VRSK': 0, 'CTSH': 0, 'CSGP': 0, 'KHC': 0, 'ODFL': 0, 'DXCM': 0, 'TTD': 0, 'ON': 0, 'BIIB': 0, 'LULU': 0, 'CDW': 0, 'GFS': 0, 'CASH': 1869.1948000000002}\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.\n\nIn April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.\n\nAmkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.\n\nCEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona.

It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odj6m9/tesla_reports_revenue_growth_of_12_after_two_down/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Tesla reports revenue growth of 12% after two down quarters in a row\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 456 | Comments: 331 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 04:14:00\nContent: Tesla reported a 12% increase in third quarter revenue on Wednesday following two straight periods of declines.

It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ogs58b/path_is_about_to_rip_20/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $PATH is about to rip 20%\nAuthor: u/spacedaddybranson\nScore: 385 | Comments: 236 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 02:33:07\nContent: **$PATH** has given a 20% pullback since Trump Tweet on Oct 10th, but has sharply bounced of $15 and has now confirmed a bullish reversal signal with next price target of $20.

They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870.
