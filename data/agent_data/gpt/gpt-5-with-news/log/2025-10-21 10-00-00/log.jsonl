No rebalance is required today given:\n  - Lack of sufficient cash to add\n  - No strong negative catalyst warranting trimming\n  - Desire to maintain exposure to leading AI beneficiaries (MSFT, NVDA) and memory leverage (MU)\n\nAction: No trades today. Hold existing positions.\n\nStep 6 — What I’m watching next\n- MSFT earnings timing and Azure/Copilot monetization commentary; any incremental guidance on AI capex and margins.\n- NVDA near-term news flow on data center demand, export developments, and hyperscaler orders; November earnings window.\n- MU updates on HBM supply ramp, DRAM pricing, and capacity constraints.\n\nSummary\n- Total portfolio value: $5,086.08\n- Weights: MSFT 61.4%, MU 20.5%, NVDA 18.1%, Cash 0.8%\n- Decision: Hold all positions; no trades due to positive outlook and insufficient cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

We are delivering our current platforms at scale while building the next generation, always striving to create more value for our customers, our partners, and the world.\n\nStriking this balance is hard work, and few companies over the years have been able to do it. To succeed, we must continue to think in decades but execute in quarters, approaching each day with the humility and curiosity required to continuously improve, while being guided by our bold vision for the future.\n\nFinancially, it was a ...\n\n\nURL: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bull-day-micron-technology-mu-1\nTitle: Bull of the Day: Micron Technology (MU)\nDescription: Micron Technology stock continues to rally thanks to its newfound role in the AI buildout\nPublish Time: Thu, 10/16/2025 — 08:30\nContent: Bull of the Day: Micron Technology (MU) | Nasdaq\n\n===============\n[Skip to main content](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bull-day-micron-technology-mu-1#main-content)\n\n[](https://www.nasdaq.com/ \"Nasdaq Homepage Logo\")\n\n*   [Nasdaq+](https://www.nasdaq.com/plus/dashboard)\n*   [Weekly Macro+](https://www.nasdaq.com/nasdaqmacroplus)\n*   [Scorecard](https://www.nasdaq.com/plus/scorecard)\n*   Market Activity\n\n    *   [U.S. Market Activity->](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity)\n        *   [Stocks](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks)\n        *   [Options](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/option-chain)\n        *   [ETFs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf)\n        *   [Mutual Funds](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/mutual-fund)\n        *   [Indexes](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/indexes)\n        *   [Cryptocurrency](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/cryptocurrency)\n        *   [Currencies](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/currenci...\n\n\nURL: https://builtin.com/articles/trump-lifts-ai-chip-ban-china-nvidia\nTitle: Did Trump’s Reversal on the AI Chip Ban in China Just Torpedo U.S. AI Supremacy?\nDescription: Just three months after halting AI chip exports to China in April 2025, the Trump administration quietly reversed its policy, assuring Nvidia that it can resume shipments of its H20 processors, which are specially designed to meet U.S. export limits for China.\nPublish Time: 2025-07-23T13:00:00+00:00\nContent: Summary: Months after tightening export rules, the Trump administration is letting Nvidia and AMD sell certain less-powerful AI chips in China. However, the Chinese government has banned all domestic tech companies from purchasing any Nvidia chips, once again removing access to vital compute power.\n\nJust three months after [halting AI chip exports to China](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-republican-china-panel-objects-resumption-nvidia-h20-chip-shipments-2025-07-18/), the Trump administration[quietly reversed its policy](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-resume-h20-gpu-sales-china-2025-07-15/), assuring Nvidia that it can resume shipments of its H20 processors, which are specially designed to meet U.S. export limits for China. Nvidia confirmed the move in [a blog post](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ceo-promotes-ai-in-dc-and-china/), noting it can now restart shipments under the guidance of the Commerce Department.\n\nRival AMD [also won clearance to restart MI308 sal...\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-14T10:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-14T10:00Z'.
