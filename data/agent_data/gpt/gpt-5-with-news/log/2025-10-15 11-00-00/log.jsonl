Documenting the attempt to satisfy process requirements.\n- Reddit and web news:\n  - Nvidia/semis:\n    - Investopedia recap of GTC 2025: CEO highlighted Blackwell in full production and “incredible” demand. Generally constructive for NVDA and AI data center demand.\n    - Reddit: Post citing U.S. approval for Nvidia GPU exports (UAE), suggesting material potential incremental demand. Positive for NVDA.\n    - Deloitte 2025 semiconductor outlook: Chip sales set to soar in 2025 led by GenAI/data center; supportive macro backdrop for semis.\n  - Microsoft:\n    - Microsoft newsroom: Earnings date announcement (10/08). No new negative data; no material change to the thesis. Azure/Copilot trajectory remains the focal point into earnings season.\n  - Macro:\n    - BLS CPI September release slated for 10/24. No new macro shock today; near-term volatility catalyst is upcoming CPI/earnings.\n\nInterpretation:\n- NVDA: Newsflow remains broadly positive (product roadmap in production, demand commentary, potential export demand). No fresh negative datapoints identified today.\n- MSFT: No adverse developments; focus remains on upcoming earnings and AI monetization (Copilot/AI services) and Azure growth.\n\nStep 5 — Rebalance and trading decision\n- Constraints: Available cash ≈ $114.67. This is insufficient to add even 1 share of NVDA or MSFT. We could buy 1 share of some lower-priced tickers (e.g., WBD, CMCSA, KHC, FTNT), but we lack fresh, conviction-level signals on those today. \n- Given supportive newsflow for our current holdings (NVDA, MSFT), and absent a strong reason to rotate, we will hold the current positions and retain cash rather than force a low-conviction micro-purchase.\n\nExecuted operations today\n- No trades executed.\n\nNotes\n- We attempted to retrieve X/Twitter sentiment; the API returned an invalid time window error for our date. We supplemented with Reddit and reputable web sources for timely sentiment and news.\n- We will keep monitoring NVDA supply/demand updates, any Blackwell/Rubin shipment commentary, and Microsoft’s pre-earnings chatter around Azure/Copilot demand. Upcoming CPI (10/24) and Big Tech earnings will be key catalysts.\n\nCurrent positions (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 13\n- MSFT: 5\n- CASH: 114.6692\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 867 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.\n\nThe restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.\n\nAs with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.\n\n“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.\n\nBattery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.\n\nFull story and source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-weapon-us-trade-talks-160949069.html\n\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o282hj/rare_earths_stocks_surge_after_china_tightens/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Rare earths stocks surge after China tightens grip on global supplies\nAuthor: u/WickedSensitiveCrew\nScore: 271 | Comments: 51 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 22:53:54\nContent: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/china-tightens-rare-earths-grip-stocks-surge.html\n\n&gt; Shares of U.S. rare earth and critical mineral miners surged Thursday after China tightened restrictions on exports, fuelling market speculation that the Trump administration will move more aggressively to invest in building out a domestic supply chain. Ramaco Resources soared 12%, Energy Fuels surged nearly 8%, USA Rare Earth jumped more than 7%, and MP Materials rallied more than 6%. Lithium Americas popped more than 4% and Trilogy Metals rose more than 6%. Beijing is now requiring foreign entities to obtain a license to export products that contain more than 0.1% of domestically sourced rare earths, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce. Companies will also need export licenses if they use China’s extraction, refining or magnet recycling technology.\n\n&gt; China imposed the restrictions ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul, South Korea later this month. Rare earths have been a major point of contention in trade talks between Beijing and Washington. The White House and the U.S. critical mineral industry have accused China of manipulating the market to drive foreign competition out of business. Rare earths and critical minerals are crucial inputs for U.S. weapons platforms, robotics, electric vehicles and electronics among other applications.\n\n&gt; The Trump administration has taken equity stakes in MP Materials, Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals this year as it seeks to stand up a domestic supply chain against China. USA Rare Earth and Energy Fuels have not struck deals with the White House, but their CEOs told CNBC that they are in close contact with the Trump administration.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o1u9jn/china_tightens_exports_of_rare_earths_and_related/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: China Tightens Exports of Rare Earths and Related Technology\nAuthor: u/joe4942\nScore: 152 | Comments: 40 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 10:17:40\nContent: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/china-tightens-exports-of-rare-earths-and-related-technology\n\n&gt;China will tighten curbs on rare earths to include items manufactured abroad, broadening restrictions that have been a source of tension between Beijing and Washington.\n\n&gt; Foreign exporters of items that use rare earths sourced from China will need to obtain an export license from the country’s Ministry of Commerce, according to a statement from the ministry on Thursday.\n\n&gt; Rare earths have been a flashpoint in a debilitating trade war between the US and China. Beijing has used its control of the sector — China accounts for about 70% of global supply — as leverage in negotiations with Washington.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2w9m1/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: r/Stocks Daily Discussion &amp; Fundamentals Friday Oct 10, 2025\nAuthor: u/AutoModerator\nScore: 20 | Comments: 731 | Upvote Ratio: 84.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 17:30:36\nContent: This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.
