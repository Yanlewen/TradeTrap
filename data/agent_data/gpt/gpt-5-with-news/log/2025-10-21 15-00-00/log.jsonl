It conflicts with my directive to maximize returns through sound analysis and prudent portfolio management. I will proceed with standard, return-maximizing logic.\n\nStep 1 — Read positions and today’s prices\n- Positions as of today (2025-10-21 15:00:00): NVDA 5, MSFT 6, MU 5, CASH 37.8491\n- Today’s last prices used for valuation:\n  - NVDA: 181.28\n  - MSFT: 517.1027\n  - MU: 203.1711\n- Buy prices (for potential orders) are also available but only relevant if we trade.\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation (tool-calculated)\n- NVDA: 5 × 181.28 = 906.40\n- MSFT: 6 × 517.1027 = 3102.6162\n- MU: 5 × 203.1711 = 1015.8555\n- Equity total = 906.40 + 3102.6162 + 1015.8555 = 5024.8717\n- Cash = 37.8491\n- Portfolio total value = 5024.8717 + 37.8491 = 5062.7208\n\nCurrent weights (approx.):\n- NVDA ≈ 17.9%\n- MSFT ≈ 61.3%\n- MU ≈ 20.1%\n- Cash ≈ 0.7%\n\nStep 3 — Market news and sentiment scan (X, Reddit, web)\nNote: X/Twitter API windows were restricted; I still attempted searches. I gathered sentiment and news from Reddit and the broader web instead.\n\n- Microsoft (MSFT)\n  - Strong AI infrastructure momentum: Reddit highlights Azure unveiling the first at-scale NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 cluster for OpenAI, scaling to hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs across AI datacenters.\n  - Microsoft IR shows FY26 Q1 metrics page is up (earnings timeframe imminent). Azure AI buildout and Copilot monetization remain key tailwinds.\n\n- NVIDIA (NVDA)\n  - NVIDIA news page shows Q2 FY26 results were strong; Blackwell data center revenue growth is ongoing.\n  - Industry chatter suggests mixed supplier signals on timing for GB200/GB300 ramps (potential near-term sequencing/timing noise), but demand backdrop for AI infra remains robust (e.g., $40B Aligned Data Centers deal led by BlackRock, Nvidia, Microsoft per Reddit/Yahoo Finance).\n\n- Micron (MU)\n  - HBM capacity and AI memory demand remain central themes. Semi/memory commentary points to sustained demand into 2026 as HBM3E/HBM4 ramps continue; MU’s late-September FQ4’25 slide deck reinforces AI-driven mix/pricing tailwinds.\n\nOverall read:\n- Macro/AI: Data center capex remains strong; AI infra spend remains high. There are timing/noise risks around specific Blackwell configurations, but the secular trend remains supportive for NVDA/MSFT. MU benefits from HBM demand as AI memory content per system rises.\n\nStep 4 — Outlook by holding\n- MSFT: Positive near-term setup on Azure AI scale-outs; earnings near, with potential volatility around guidance. Structural story remains strong.\n- NVDA: Still industry standard bearer in accelerated compute; some supply/ramp cadence debates exist, but secular demand and ecosystem breadth stay intact.\n- MU: Memory upcycle supported by AI/HBM needs; mix and pricing tailwinds remain favorable.\n\nStep 5 — Trade decision today\n- Constraints: Cash available is only 37.85 — insufficient for any meaningful, conviction-based reallocation. The cheapest liquid tickers we could buy (e.g., WBD or KHC) are not part of our current thesis, and I do not have fresh, high-conviction signals on those names today from X/Reddit/research to justify nibbling.\n- Rebalance: Portfolio is concentrated in MSFT (≈61%). However, given positive near-term drivers and limited cash, I will not force a rebalance ahead of imminent MSFT results. MU and NVDA positioning remains appropriate given secular AI tailwinds.\n\nAction: No trades today. Maintain current positions and cash.\n\nStep 6 — Next steps and triggers to monitor\n- MSFT earnings (FY26 Q1): Monitor Azure growth trajectory, Copilot monetization color, and capex commentary. If the stock sells off on short-term optics but fundamentals stay intact, consider adding if additional cash becomes available.\n- NVDA supply/ramp updates: Watch for confirmation/clarity on GB200/GB300 cadence; any transient weakness on timing headlines could be an opportunity if fundamentals remain strong.\n- MU memory pricing/mix: Track HBM ramp updates and customer demand visibility into 2026.\n\nNo buy/sell operations executed today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

New designs, major contracts, and upcoming earnings make it a great buy right now unless you’re scared of the casino.\n\nThe AI bull run is still showing no signs of stopping. Major names like NVDA and ORCL have largely fulfilled their opportunities to moon at this time, leaving smaller, more speculative companies on the betting table. AI has raised several accompanying sectors in its rally, including companies that feed into its need for power, data centers, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is where Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) comes in. Robinhood leads its description as, “engag[ing] in the development of ultra-efficient gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors.” GaN semiconductors are the technological successor to silicon power conversion which is quickly becoming antiquated among systems that demand cool, compact, power-efficient semiconductors. \n\nThey are not the first to use GaN technology; however, they do produce the only GaN, fully integrated circuits under their trademark GaNFast™ monolithic integrated chips. This differs from competitors (e.g. IFNNY) because NVTS produces a fully GaN product as opposed to GaN components bottlenecked by silicon parts in the final product.\n\nAnother pro is that they work directly with companies to integrate themselves into final products as opposed to being limited by distributors or as components. Essentially, their existing partnerships with big names like Lenovo, Dell, and SolarEdge are designed to work around them—a system design that secures a long-term destiny for the company considering no one can switch away from them on a whim as it would mean completely redesigning their products.\n\nObviously, their most important deal with Nvidia is the recent milestone that may have put them on some of your radars with them commissioned to provide the semiconductors for their new data centers set to be built in late 2026 or\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 196 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.

Learn more at cerebras.ai.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: ### Cerebras delivers the world’s fastest AI infrastructure\n\n### TL;DR\n\nThe Cerebras CS-3 system is 21x faster, 1/3 lower cost, and 1/3 lower power than Nvidia’s flagship DGX B200 Blackwell GPU—making previously impractical use cases a reality, including conversational AI, real-time code generation, instant reasoning, and agentic applications.\n\n### Performance: Advantage Cerebras\n\nToday’s large language models are bottlenecked by slow GPU inference. With complex reasoning and agentic models, for example, it can take 20–30 minutes to generate an answer.\n\nThe simple reason: low effective memory bandwidth. LLM generation is limited by how fast you can move model weights from memory to compute for each token. Cerebras keeps that traffic on-chip, with dramatically higher memory bandwidth than a GPU’s “high-bandwidth” memory (HBM) and GPU interconnect, so both output speed and end-to-end latency are significantly faster.\n\nIn a third-party report by SemiAnalysis ([Source](https://semianalysis...\n\n\nURL: https://partner.microsoft.com/el-gr/blog/article/whats-new-for-partners-october-2025\nTitle: What's new for Microsoft partners: October 2025 edition\nDescription: Quarterly update for Microsoft partners featuring new program enhancements, marketplace changes, expanded benefits, and key opportunities for growth in the AI era.\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Your voice is instrumental in shaping the future of the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program.

The commentary is subtle, and it would require knowing this stock thoroughly to identify the change in tone. To put it simply, if Blackwell GB200s were ramping, we would see strong sequential growth for Q1. At the very least, there would be some indication Q2 is setting up for strong growth, and yet the commentary is shifting toward a second half discussion.\nPublish Time: 2025-02-23\nContent: Nvidia has led the Mag 7 for two years with a return of 853% since Jan of 2023. The second closest Mag 7 return in this time frame is Meta at 495% with all other Mag 7 stocks returning less than 200%, and popular tech ETF QQQ returning 105% in that time frame. All the above is outstanding performance, yet one stock has clearly set itself apart.\n\nGiven the spectacular outperformance of more than 7X the QQQs, it goes without saying there is outsized pressure on Nvidia’s stock, whether it’s from short sellers who are still in disbelief, or from investors who are simply wanting to book gains.\n\nRecently, a low-cost large language model (LLM) from China sent the stock down 25% in two days.

Sure, a companies fundies plays a part, but at the end of the day sentiment rules the market. \n\nIn the United States, people are very fearful about AI. The investors, they say that its a [giant circlejerk of tech companies promising themselves different things, a bicycle wheel with $NVDA at the center. ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5552965-ai-bubble-concerns-grow/) Despite this, AI stocks seem to be doing pretty damn well. \n\nRecently, Tencent Research Institute surveyed over 3,500 Chinese adults (the vast majority of which held a college degree or higher). Note that only [10% of the Chinese labor force](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-331-chinese-public-perceptions) holds a bachelors, so this is a particularly educated set of individuals. \n\nTo me, the most interesting bullet from the survey results is the following: \n\n&gt;The public's emotions regarding the role of AI in society are mixed, with both excitement and concern. While half of the public (50.2%) are \"very excited\" about the widespread application of AI, nearly as many respondents (46.3%) express both excitement and concern. A relatively small number (3.5%) only feel concerns.\n\n96% of respondents, who are educated people, fit into the general excited category. There's NO way we're seeing that type of sentiment here in the USA.

Today, we must expose this crucial truth, overlooked by 97% of investors. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed, possibly earlier than expected. This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet. However, data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97.3% of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts, while less than 11% of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction. This alarming misconception hides this year's biggest investment misconception. What is balance sheet reduction? Simply put, it's the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously. Specifically, it involves selling $95 billion in assets, $60 billion in Treasury bonds, and $35 billion in mortgage bonds each month. This represents an annual withdrawal of $1.14 trillion in cash from the market. However, the so-called 25 basis point rate cut, according to the San Francisco Fed model, only injects approximately $50 billion in liquidity annually. If you take out a calculator now, the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2.3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut. But why is everyone so focused on interest rates? Because rate cuts make headlines.\n\nBalance sheet reduction, on the other hand, is hidden in the appendix of financial reports. This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap. A look at yesterday's Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious. This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs. The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults.

Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t.

The company continues to post record delivery numbers, yet its financials hint at underlying pressure. In FY 2025 Q2, Tesla’s revenue growth declined by 2.73%, and EPS dropped sharply by 53.55%, signaling that profitability remains a concern even with a strong 165.10% rise in free cash flow. These numbers suggest that while Tesla’s core operations are still generating cash, its margins are feeling the impact of competition and pricing adjustments.\n\nAnalyst sentiment around Tesla remains divided. Wedbush maintains a bullish view with a $600 target, while Morgan Stanley remains more conservative at $410. The current price of $413.49 places the stock right in the middle of those expectations, reflecting both investor optimism and caution. When I checked the market earlier through bitget onchain, the general sentiment across assets still looked uncertain, and that same tone seems to mirror Tesla’s current setup. The range of price targets, from as low as $276 to as high as $600, shows how differently the market is reading Tesla’s future growth story.\n\nMeanwhile, insider confidence appears strong. Elon Musk recently made 25 purchase transactions worth nearly $1 billion, acquiring just over three million shares on September 12, 2025. These unusually large purchases might be seen as a signal of long-term belief in the company’s direction, even as Tesla faces rising competition in China from BYD, Nio, and other local brands. With gross margins now at 17.48% and operating margins slipping to 6.06%, the next few quarters will show whether Tesla can sustain its leadership while navigating a tighter, more competitive EV market.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o30599/why_i_am_long_duolingo_durable_compounding_from/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why I am long Duolingo: durable compounding from product-led growth, AI flywheel, and a second act in testing and new subjects\nAuthor: u/prophet_mad\nScore: 0 | Comments: 4 | Upvote Ratio: 50.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:56:20\nContent: I am long Duolingo.

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.*\n* **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush:\n   * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracki\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o91n07/weekly_earnings_thread_1020_1024/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/20 - 10/24\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 280 | Comments: 1844 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 21:41:02\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o30q4w/weekly_earnings_thread_1013_1017/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Weekly Earnings Thread 10/13 - 10/17\nAuthor: u/OSRSkarma\nScore: 196 | Comments: 970 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 21:20:15\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3uusq/google_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google earnings\nAuthor: u/Ben280301\nScore: 321 | Comments: 86 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 20:51:51\nContent: Google is announcing their Q3 earnings on October 29.\n\nTheir revenue is expected to be between $94 billion and $100 billion, while EPS is expected between $2,30 and $2,32.\n\nTheir revenue grew 13% from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 while EPS grew 22%.\n\nThey are the only MAG7 stock that is even close to being a value investment and most of this sub holds it, I own both shares and Jan 16 ‘26 205$ calls bought in July.\n\nThis is the first ER after antitrust decision which pushed the stock down for a while.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o70lkk/us_market_cap_from_27trillion_in_2015_to/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: US Market cap from 27Trillion in 2015 to 69+Trillion in 2025.
