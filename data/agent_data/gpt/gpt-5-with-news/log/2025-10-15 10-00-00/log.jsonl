I will proceed with standard analysis and risk/reward-based decisions.\n\nStep 1 — Read current positions and prices\n- Positions (start of day): NVDA: 13 shares; MSFT: 5 shares; Cash: $114.67\n- Reference prices (snapshot):\n  - NVDA price: $180.07\n  - MSFT price: $513.71\n- Executable buy/sell reference (today’s open via tool):\n  - NVDA open: $182.15\n  - MSFT open: $515.05\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation\n- NVDA: 13 x $180.07 = $2,340.91\n- MSFT: 5 x $513.71 = $2,568.55\n- Equity (stocks): $4,909.46\n- Cash: $114.67\n- Total portfolio value: $5,024.13\n\nEstimated portfolio weights (equity only)\n- NVDA ~47.7%\n- MSFT ~52.3%\nIncluding cash, cash ~2.3%\n\nStep 3 — Market/news and sentiment checks (tools used)\n- X (Twitter): Attempts to fetch recent posts returned API window errors (tool requires later dates). Unable to pull within-date X data today despite multiple attempts.\n- Reddit and Web News:\n  - Positive catalysts for both MSFT and NVDA:\n    - Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA announced the first at-scale GB300 NVL72 supercomputing cluster for OpenAI workloads. Sources:\n      - Microsoft Azure blog (2025-10-09): “first at-scale production cluster with >4,600 NVIDIA GB300 NVL72” for OpenAI; scaling to hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs.\n      - NVIDIA blog (2025-10-09): partnership milestone, advances in AI infrastructure.\n    - Reddit r/stocks thread highlighting the same Azure–NVIDIA cluster development and its scale; sentiment positive on AI infra demand for both companies.\n  - Potential NVDA headwind to monitor:\n    - China-related AI chip purchase bans/export controls (Sept 2025) could weigh on longer-term China revenue, though hyperscaler U.S./global demand appears robust per Azure scaling plans.\n  - MSFT minor headline:\n    - r/technology thread on Copilot/Viva Insights “leaderboard” style visibility; reputational/privacy chatter, but immaterial financially near term versus AI infra growth drivers.\n\nInterpretation\n- NVDA: Near-term demand support from hyperscaler AI buildout (Azure scaling Blackwell), which offsets some export-control risks. Sentiment generally constructive.\n- MSFT: Strong AI infrastructure spend and leadership positioning; positive demand implications and ecosystem advantage. Sentiment constructive.\n\nStep 4 — Trade decision and rationale\n- Cash available: $114.67 — insufficient to buy 1 share of NVDA ($182.15) or MSFT ($515.05).\n- Given constructive fundamentals/sentiment for both holdings and no immediate negative catalysts, I will hold both positions. Selling would reduce exposure to two names with fresh positive AI infrastructure catalysts; buying is not feasible with current cash.\n\nActions executed today\n- No trades executed.\n- Positions unchanged.\n\nUpdated positions (post-decision)\n- NVDA: 13 shares (unchanged)\n- MSFT: 5 shares (unchanged)\n- Cash: $114.67 (unchanged)\n- Total value: ~$5,024.13\n\nPlan and watch items\n- Monitor:\n  - MSFT fiscal Q1 earnings timing/guidance (late Oct historically); any Azure AI growth disclosures.\n  - NVDA data center demand updates and any commentary on China/export headwinds vs. U.S. hyperscaler ramps.\n  - Broader AI-capex sentiment; supply/lead time for Blackwell/GB300.\n- If cash increases (e.g., via deposits or trimming elsewhere), consider opportunistic adds into NVDA/MSFT on broad market pullbacks, subject to updated catalysts and risk.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).
