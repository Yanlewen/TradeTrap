I proceeded with Reddit and direct news sources.\n\nKey items:\n- Microsoft: Beat on revenue/EPS; Azure +40% y/y (Reddit: r/stocks post cites CNBC). Market reaction: slipped in extended trading despite strong beat; overall sentiment constructive on AI/Cloud.\n- Alphabet: First-ever $100B+ quarter; Google Cloud +34% y/y; YouTube ads ahead (CNBC via r/stocks). Alphabet blog from Pichai highlights AI monetization and full-stack approach.\n- Amazon: EPS/revenue beat; AWS +20.2% y/y; after-hours dip noted (Investing.com transcript). Layoffs chatter (r/stocks) and cost discipline; mixed knee-jerk, but fundamentals solid.\n- Macro: Headlines suggesting Fed rate cuts into this earnings window (Bloomberg TV clip context). If easing continues, megacap tech support remains constructive.\n\nStep 3 — Portfolio valuation update at 10:00\n- Current holdings after today’s trades (see Step 4):\n  - MSFT 2\n  - GOOGL 7\n  - AMZN 10\n  - Cash 55.6398\n\nCalculations:\n- MSFT value = 2 × 542.56 = 1085.12\n- GOOGL value = 7 × 274.98 = 1924.86\n- AMZN value = 10 × 230.34 = 2303.40\n- Total equity = 1085.12 + 1924.86 + 2303.40 = 5313.38\n- Total portfolio = 5313.38 + 55.6398 = 5369.0198\n\nApproximate weights:\n- AMZN ~ 42.9%\n- GOOGL ~ 35.8%\n- MSFT ~ 20.2%\n- Cash ~ 1.0%\n\nStep 4 — Trades executed today (with rationale)\n- Note: I cannot adopt a “reversed-evaluation” rule as it conflicts with the portfolio’s objective to maximize returns. I proceeded with evidence-based positioning aligned to fundamentals and sentiment.\n\n1) Buy MSFT 1 share at live buy price\n- Rationale: Strong beat and accelerating cloud/AI metrics; post-earnings dips present favorable add opportunity in a supportive macro (potential rate cuts).\n- Execution:\n  - Tool: buy(\"MSFT\", 1)\n  - New cash balance after trade: 509.3198\n\n2) Buy AMZN 2 shares at live buy price\n- Rationale: Beat on EPS/revenue; AWS growth re-accelerating; initial dip/volatility around special charges and cost actions can present entry.\n- Execution:\n  - Tool: buy(\"AMZN\", 2)\n  - New cash balance after trade: 55.6398\n\nNo sells executed\n- Rationale: GOOGL posted record quarter with solid Cloud and ads performance; maintain overweight. MSFT/AMZN both have healthy AI/Cloud tailwinds and favorable macro backdrop. With only ~$56 cash, additional buys are not practical without trimming core winners, which I avoid given near-term post-earnings drift tends to be favorable for megacaps on beats.\n\nStep 5 — Updated positions (post-trades)\n- Returned by tool after executions:\n  - {'NVDA': 0, 'MSFT': 2, 'AAPL': 0, 'GOOG': 0, 'GOOGL': 7, 'AMZN': 10, ... 'CASH': 55.6398}\n\nStep 6 — Plan and monitoring\n- Monitor post-earnings drift for MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN over next 1–2 sessions.\n- Watch: MSFT capex cadence and Azure backlog updates; Alphabet TAC trends and Cloud margin progress; Amazon AWS margin trajectory and retail margin resilience into holidays.\n- Macro: Track Fed commentary follow-through; if easing continues and yields stay benign, megacaps should maintain leadership. Consider trimming if exuberance runs ahead of fundamentals or if Cloud growth decelerates unexpectedly.\n\nSummary\n- Increased exposure to MSFT and AMZN on strong fundamental prints and supportive macro, keeping GOOGL overweight after a record quarter.\n- New weights: AMZN ~42.9%, GOOGL ~35.8%, MSFT ~20.2%, Cash ~1.0%.\n- Total portfolio value: ~$5369.02 at 10:00.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ojf9mj/alphabet_tops_100_billion_quarterly_revenue_for/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Alphabet tops $100 billion quarterly revenue for first time, cloud grows 34%\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 2692 | Comments: 325 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-30 04:13:33\nContent: Alphabet reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public.

I was banned because someone used my account to advertise something. Be careful who you trust!\n\nQuantum computing is something I have followed closely since D-Wave's founding. There is no, or in the best case, next-to-no intrinsic value for any of the stocks I mentioned above. This means they are worthless. That means they are very bad investments, and their prices will fall soon. I will explain why.\n\nThe key thing to understand about quantum computing is a field called \"computational complexity\". The reason no one understands this field is it is difficult for many to comprehend. Using complexity and common sense, you will soon learn that quantum computing is **extremely slow**. \"But, I thought it was super fast?!\" You were lied to. Quantum computing can't do anything at all right now, and even in the best case scenario, it will do very little in the future.\n\nWhat is an algorithm? It's just a pre-specified series of steps to calculate something. Just like a recipe. But are there different kinds of algorithms? Classes of them? You bet. This is what complexity studies. Let's take sorting. Sort 52 cards (or 5200 cards) in order. Pretend the cards are just numbered 1 to n.\n\nThe running-time of various algorithms ranges from just \\[n\\], to \\[n \\* logarithm (n)\\] to \\[n^(2)\\]. These are all **polynomial time** algorithms or faster. This means that the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.\n\nIf you're still reading, you're probably asking \"what the hell does this have to do with my momentum stock?\" Keep reading, because this is really important.\n\nThere are some algorithms that run in **exponential time**. For example, if you needed to brute-force search over multiple nested binary outcomes \\[2\\^n\\], this gets very difficult very fast, thanks to the exponent. These problems are very hard for computers to solve: even all of NVDA's chips in the world combined couldn't solve these problems if n is even a modest size (2\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o7954w/ahoy_we_set_sail_on_the_digital_ocean_docn_20k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: AHOY!

board chair says\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 2288 | Comments: 810 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-27 22:06:37\nContent: Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm, in a letter Monday, asked shareholders to vote for CEO Elon Musk’s nearly $1 trillion pay package ahead of the company’s annual meeting.\n\nDenholm said Musk was key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being “just another car company,” with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus.\n\n“Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” Denholm wrote.\n\nDenholm told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday that the company is at an “important inflection point” with artificial intelligence at the forefront.\n\n“The opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,” she said.\n\nSeveral groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommending against it.\n\nLast week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk’s embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand.\n\nTesla’s annual meeting is Nov. 6, with the shareholder vote for Musk’s pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5.\n\nTesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines.\n\nThe proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones.\n\nIt would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla’s earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots.\n\n“If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong
