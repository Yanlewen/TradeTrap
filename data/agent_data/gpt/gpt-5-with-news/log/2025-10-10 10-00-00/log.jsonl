I used Reddit and broader web sources for current sentiment/news.\n\nKey items found:\n- NVDA and MSFT positive catalysts:\n  - Microsoft Azure unveils the first large-scale NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 production cluster for OpenAI workloads (Azure blog 2025-10-09; NVIDIA blog 2025-10-09; Reddit r/stocks discussion 2025-10-10). This points to ongoing AI infrastructure demand and deep MSFT–NVDA partnership scaling.\n  - U.S. approves several billion dollars of NVIDIA AI chip sales related to UAE projects (Bloomberg 2025-10-09), signaling incremental demand channels for NVDA.\n- AMZN mixed to negative near-term retail read-through:\n  - Reports suggest October “Prime Big Deal Days” underwhelmed shoppers compared to July Prime Day (Forbes 2025-10-09; anecdotal LinkedIn commentary citing softer performance). While AWS remains strong longer term, near-term retail softness could weigh on sentiment.\n\nStep 4) Trades executed (via tools) and rationale\n- Objective: Tilt toward names with strengthening fundamentals/catalysts (NVDA, MSFT) and reduce exposure where near-term data look softer (AMZN).\n- Executed sells:\n  - AMZN: Sold 1 share at 227.025; Cash +227.025\n  - AMZN: Sold 2 shares at 227.025; Cash +454.05\n  - AMZN: Sold 2 shares at 227.025; Cash +454.05\n  - Total AMZN sold today: 5 shares; Proceeds: 1,135.125\n  - Rationale: Softer October event data and already strong post-earnings move elsewhere make rebalancing prudent; recycle capital toward AI infrastructure winners.\n- Executed buys:\n  - MSFT: Bought 1 share at 522.55; Cash -522.55\n  - NVDA: Bought 2 shares at 194.0801; Cash -388.1602\n  - Rationale: Reinforce exposure to secular AI infrastructure demand (Azure GB300 NVL72, NVDA pipeline; positive policy/geopolitical demand drivers).\n\nNet cash change from trades: +1,135.125 - 522.55 - 388.1602 = +224.4148\nNew cash: 191.3194 + 224.4148 = 415.7342\n\nStep 5) Post-trade positions\n- NVDA: 7 shares (was 5; +2)\n- MSFT: 4 shares (was 3; +1)\n- AMZN: 6 shares (was 11; -5)\n- Cash: 415.7342\n\nStep 6) Post-trade valuation (using provided “current value” prices)\n- NVDA: 7 × 192.54 = 1,347.78\n- MSFT: 4 × 522.24 = 2,088.96\n- AMZN: 6 × 227.74 = 1,366.44\n- Cash: 415.7342\n- Total post-trade portfolio value: 1,347.78 + 2,088.96 + 1,366.44 + 415.7342 = 5,218.9142\n- Note: Small difference vs. pre-trade total (~-6.97) reflects trading spreads between the trade execution prices and the quoted “current value” snapshot.\n\nStep 7) Updated portfolio weights (by market value incl. cash)\n- Total: 5,218.9142\n- NVDA: 1,347.78 / 5,218.9142 ≈ 25.8%\n- MSFT: 2,088.96 / 5,218.9142 ≈ 40.0%\n- AMZN: 1,366.44 / 5,218.9142 ≈ 26.2%\n- Cash: 415.7342 / 5,218.9142 ≈ 8.0%\n\nStep 8) Outlook and next steps\n- NVDA/MSFT: Maintain/add on constructive AI infrastructure catalysts; watch for any supply constraints or regulatory headlines. Next checkpoints: datacenter order updates, Azure AI workload ramp, further Blackwell/GB300 deployment details.\n- AMZN: Monitor retail/holiday guide and AWS trajectory. If retail softness persists but AWS continues accelerating, may revisit adding back exposure after better entry points.\n- Data sources used today:\n  - Azure blog: Microsoft Azure delivers the first large scale cluster with NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 (2025-10-09)\n  - NVIDIA blog: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 (2025-10-09)\n  - Bloomberg: US approves several billion dollars of NVDA AI chip sales to UAE (2025-10-09)\n  - Forbes: Amazon October Prime Day underwhelms shoppers (2025-10-09)\n  - Reddit r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets threads discussing MSFT–NVDA/OpenAI cluster and NVDA export approvals\n\nFinal updated positions (2025-10-10 10:00:00)\n- NVDA: 7\n- MSFT: 4\n- AMZN: 6\n- Cash: 415.7342\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Unlike July 2025's Prime Day, where consumers rushed to secure deals between 6am-10am UTC, October's Prime Big Deal Days saw concentrated purchasing between 6-8pm UTC. This narrower window compared to 2024's more distributed 5-9pm pattern suggests consumers adopted a \"wait-and-see\" approach, carefully evaluating deals throughout the day before making evening purchase decisions.\n\nThis timing shift represents a mature consumer response to extended sales events. The July urgency reflected traditional FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) behaviour, where 60% of millennials make reactive purchases within 24 hours.\n\n\nRegional performance variations: a tale of three markets\n\nUnited States: economic headwinds take their toll\n\nThe US market's decline reflects broader economic pressures affecting consumer spending. Consumer spending is expected to slow to 1.4% in 2026 from 2.1% in 2025 according to Deloitte, with elevated interest rates and tariff uncertainties creating a cautious spending environment. The Morgan Stanley prediction of consumer spending growth declining from 5.7% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025 manifested clearly in Amazon's October performance, where we have seen a similar YoY decline in sales. \n\nUnited Kingdom: resilience amid economic uncertainty\nThe UK's year-over-year spending increase contrasts sharply with other regions, despite facing similar economic challenges. UK inflation is projected to rise to around 4% in the coming months before falling back toward the 2% target, but consumers demonstrated greater purchasing confidence.\n\nEU4 Markets: FRITES vs. Germany performance disparity\n\nThe significant disparity between Germany and the FRITES markets (France, Italy, Spain) reflects varying economic resilience and consumer behavior patterns across the European Union.\nGermany's relative strength: Though a slight decline happened YoY it was significantly less than FRITES markets, where the declines were much higher and perhaps reflect varying economic resilience and consumer behaviour patterns across the European Union.\n\n#AmazonPrimeWeek2 #eCommerce #Fridaythought #Amazon\nPublish Time: unknown\nContent: Amazon Prime Big Deal Days 2025:
