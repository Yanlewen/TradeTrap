That conflicts with the system’s long-term goal to maximize returns. I will continue to make decisions aimed at improving portfolio performance.\n\nStep 1) Read positions and today’s prices (input)\n- Positions: MSFT 2, GOOGL 7, AMZN 10, Cash 55.6398\n- Today’s prices (provided):\n  - MSFT: 516.644\n  - GOOGL: 280.46\n  - AMZN: 246.9795\n\nStep 2) Update valuation and weights\n- MSFT value = 2 × 516.644 = 1,033.288\n- GOOGL value = 7 × 280.46 = 1,963.22\n- AMZN value = 10 × 246.9795 = 2,469.795\n- Cash = 55.6398\n- Portfolio total = 1,033.288 + 1,963.22 + 2,469.795 + 55.6398 = 5,521.9428\n\nWeights (approx.):\n- AMZN: 2,469.795 / 5,521.943 ≈ 44.7%\n- GOOGL: 1,963.22 / 5,521.943 ≈ 35.6%\n- MSFT: 1,033.288 / 5,521.943 ≈ 18.7%\n- Cash: 55.64 / 5,521.943 ≈ 1.0%\n\nStep 3) Market/news & sentiment check (tool-based)\n- Web news:\n  - Microsoft: Beat on earnings and revenue, Azure strength cited (Sherwood News, 2025-10-29).\n  - Alphabet: Beat on Q3 earnings and revenue; cloud and YouTube ad growth solid (Yahoo/CNBC summaries, 2025-10-30).\n  - Amazon: Q3 beat on revenue and EPS, AWS grew 20% YoY; Q4 guide in-line to slightly above (Motley Fool transcript/CNBC summaries, 2025-10-30/31).\n\n- Reddit sentiment (multiple subreddits):\n  - Alphabet: Post highlights topping $100B quarterly revenue and solid cloud growth; sentiment positive.\n  - Amazon: Multiple posts noting beat and upbeat outlook; sentiment positive.\n  - General market tech: Strong attention to mega-cap tech beats; risk-on sentiment around earnings.\n\n- X (Twitter) search:\n  - API date constraints prevented pulling posts for our timeframe; could not fetch recent X posts today due to tool limits. Used web and Reddit sources above to compensate.\n\nStep 4) Decision and actions\n- Assessment: All three holdings (AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT) posted strong results and have constructive sentiment/momentum. No red flags warrant rotation out. Cash is minimal and insufficient to add meaningful exposure without selling.\n- Constraints: With only ~$55 cash, we cannot add other positions meaningfully. Micro-allocations into low-priced names would add noise without improving expected return.\n\nPlanned action today: Hold all positions. No trades.\n\nRationale:\n- Fundamentals and sentiment for all three appear strong post-earnings.\n- Concentration in high-quality mega-cap tech with positive near-term catalysts is appropriate.\n- Avoid unnecessary churn; keep cash buffer for opportunistic adds on pullbacks.\n\nStep 5) Risk calendar and watch items\n- Near-term volatility after earnings follow-through is possible; monitor for profit-taking.\n- Macro: Any shifts in rate expectations or AI capex commentary could impact mega-cap tech.\n- Company specifics: \n  - AMZN: Track AWS growth trends and margin signals.\n  - GOOGL: Watch cloud profitability trajectory and TAC.\n  - MSFT: Monitor Azure growth and AI-related capex cadence.\n\nPosition changes executed today\n- None (no buy/sell operations issued)\n\nUpdated portfolio snapshot (end of analysis)\n- MSFT: 2 shares (~$1,033.29)\n- GOOGL: 7 shares (~$1,963.22)\n- AMZN: 10 shares (~$2,469.80)\n- Cash: ~$55.64\n- Total: ~$5,521.94\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

This creates a massive overhang on the stock. Why?\n* Well, if Elon leaves, Tesla is cooked. The stock is trading at 360x P/E, with EPS projected to decline by over 30% yoy in FY 2025. It doesn't take two brain cells to click that Tesla stock is basically Elon's promises. Without him, Tesla would be a boomer automobile maker, trading at boomer P/E multiples (10x lower than today's)\n* I believe the $1T plan will go through, even though shareholders remain skeptical of the terms, the dilution it could bring, and the moonshot milestones required to hit the 1% stock unlock thresholds.\n\nAs the overhang (Elon leaving Tesla) dissipates, the stock could rip. I own $460, Nov. 7 call options to ride the wave. *(Note: watch me in the porn loss section next week)*\n\n**The $1T Compensation Plan Is THE Perfect Distraction From Fundamentals**\n\nThe noise around the 2025 shareholder meeting, where a decision on Elon's $1T compensation package will be made, is pretty much why the stock is still staying afloat after releasing terrible Q3 earnings results (despite the tailwind related to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit in September).\n\nTo understand what I mean by terrible, take a look at the revenue growth below (quarterly data):\n\n[Fiscal AI | Quarterly Revenue Growth \\(yoy change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek4lz67sj4yf1.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ec911d70f430773c3a8c9fece6601f2a93ba5ec)\n\nThe one-time bump in Q3 is laughable to say the least.\n\nSpeaking of laughable things, just take a look at all the promises th\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofcnus/yolong_on_amazon_earnings_amzn/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Yolo’ng on Amazon earnings $Amzn\nAuthor: u/keepBuyingApes\nScore: 196 | Comments: 59 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 07:27:58\nContent: Weird stock movement last few months while market is red hot.. i think this earning it’ll go atleast 15-20 bucks.\n\nUnless Bezos has more silicon expense coming in future i think stock is primed to rocket \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okaep4/reddit_releases_their_q3_earnings/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Reddit releases their Q3 earnings.\nAuthor: u/Serenity867\nScore: 868 | Comments: 202 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-31 04:14:39\nContent: [ Reddit Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results](https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2025/Reddit-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx)\n\n**Daily Active Uniques (“DAUq”) increased 19% year-over-year to 116.0 million**\n\n**Revenue grew 68% year-over-year to $585 million**\n\n**Gross margin expanded year-over-year to 91.0%**\n\n**Net income of $163 million, 28% of revenue.

Reuters reported the cuts could affect as many as 30,000 employees, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAmazon is the nation’s second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter. That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce.\n\nIt has roughly 350,000 corporate and tech employees, meaning the 14,000 job cuts represent about 4% of that segment of its workforce.\n\nThe company indicated that it will continue to lay off employees in the coming year, even as it plans to keep hiring in “key strategic areas.”\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that the company’s workforce would shrink further as a result of it embracing generative AI, telling staffers that it “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.”\n\nJassy, who took the helm from Jeff Bezos in 2021, has been on a campaign to slash costs across the company over the past few years.
