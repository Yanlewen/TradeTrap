Broader AI spend skepticism headlines appear occasionally, but no new adverse development located today.\n\nStep 4 — Portfolio decision logic\n- MU: The Samsung HBM3E approval for NVDA’s GB300 introduces incremental competitive headwinds for Micron’s HBM narrative near term. Risk/reward skews unfavorably in the wake of the news. Action: reduce/exit MU.\n- NVDA: Added positive supply/diversification catalyst and continued AI accelerator leadership. Action: increase NVDA.\n- MSFT: No material change in thesis from today’s checks. Action: hold.\n\nStep 5 — Executed trades (tool calls)\n- Sold MU 6 shares in two tranches (3 + 3). New cash balance after sales: 1186.9041\n- Bought NVDA 6 shares. New cash balance after buy: 113.6541\n\nStep 6 — Updated positions and valuation (post-trade)\n- New positions (shares): NVDA 13, MSFT 5, MU 0, Cash 113.6541\n- Current valuation (using same prices):\n  - NVDA: 13 × 178.8701 = 2325.3113\n  - MSFT: 5 × 519.49 = 2597.45\n  - Cash: 113.6541\n  - Total ≈ 2325.3113 + 2597.45 + 113.6541 = 5036.4154\n- Portfolio weights (approx.):\n  - NVDA ≈ 46.2%\n  - MSFT ≈ 51.6%\n  - Cash ≈ 2.3%\n\nStep 7 — Rationale and next checkpoints\n- Rationale:\n  - Exited MU due to near-term HBM share risk with Samsung’s HBM3E reportedly approved for NVDA GB300.\n  - Added to NVDA on positive supply-chain development supporting continued execution in accelerators.\n  - Maintained MSFT given stable outlook and no fresh negative catalysts today.\n- What I’m watching next:\n  - Any official confirmation or details from NVDA/Samsung on HBM3E supply volumes/pricing/timing.\n  - Competitive HBM updates from Micron and SK hynix.\n  - AI data center power buildout timelines and any utility/regulatory friction that could temper the near-term spend curve.\n  - Microsoft updates on Azure/Copilot adoption into next earnings.\n\nCurrent positions summary\n- NVDA: 13 shares\n- MSFT: 5 shares\n- Cash: 113.6541\n\nI will continue to monitor news/sentiment and adjust as catalysts evolve.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o75ac8/cifr_bitcoin_miner_turned_hpcai_data_center/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: CIFR: bitcoin miner turned HPC/AI data center!\nAuthor: u/Dyce10x\nScore: 192 | Comments: 47 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 16:19:08\nContent: CIFR (21$/s).

Hyper scales are bidding hard to capture as many MW/GW data centers deals. The demand outweighs the supply.\n\nBy August bitcoin mining companies that had the land and the power begin swapping out their ASIC and converting some data centers for HPC. \n\nCIFR signed a deal with fluid stack worth 3B and Google backstopped it.

This would bring the evaluation to $25-25B ($65-$75/s price). I would expect them to announce it before earnings Oct. 28 or after in November. \n\nOnce every deal in the to pipeline is made of 3.2GW it leads to 57B valuation ($145/s)\n\nCurrently, the stock hasn’t been rerated as it’s being treated still as a bitcoin miner. Rerating is on the horizon after the 300MW deal which could be soon. \n\nIf you want daily chatter and deep-dive understanding I would recommend following Mike Alfred &amp; Eric Jackson on X. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7aj4i/blackrock_nvidia_and_microsoft_lead_40b_data/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: BlackRock, Nvidia, and Microsoft lead $40B data center deal as AI infrastructure spending hits $400B in 2025\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 238 | Comments: 37 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 21:08:17\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-nvidia-buy-aligned-data-113817104.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-nvidia-buy-aligned-data-113817104.html)\n\n&gt;An investor group, including BlackRock and Nvidia, will buy Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie Asset Management in a deal worth $40 billion, the companies said on Wednesday, as AI infrastructure expansion powers on.\n\n&gt;The deal underscores an intensifying race to expand the costly, supply-constrained infrastructure required to develop artificial intelligence technology, as companies rush to build sophisticated AI models.\n\n&gt;The acquisition follows a slew of mega-deals focused on securing coveted compute capacity.

It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment.

Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2.\n\nI also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions.

This is what set everything in motion.\n\nAnd if you want to understand where this trade war is going, these are the **keywords** you need to keep in mind, from the Chinese side:\n\n* **Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM)**: The department behind the new export controls.\n* **Announcement No. 61 (2025)**: The legal document that changed the game.\n* **Safeguard national security and interests**: Beijing’s official justification for the policy.\n* **Overseas Specific Export Operators**: This is how China now labels foreign companies and individuals affected by the rules.\n* **Dual-Use Export License**: The new permit required before exporting controlled materials or tech.\n* **Approval System Website**: The online portal where exporters must apply for those licenses ([link takes you to that Chinese portal](https://ecomp.mofcom.gov.cn/)).\n* **FDP Rule**: The U.S. Foreign Direct Product Rule, which controls foreign-made goods using U.S. chip technology. China has mentioned that what they’re doing (which, let’s face it, represents attempting to impose extraterritorial regulatory power and control beyond its borders) is similar to what the U.S. does with the FDP Rule. In other words, just as the U.S. places regulations on its chip technology to safeguard U.S. national security and interests, China argues it is now mo\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Semiconductors/comments/1o9komy/tsmc_kaohsiung_fab_hits_2nm_trial_production/\nSubreddit: r/Semiconductors\nTitle: TSMC Kaohsiung Fab Hits 2nm Trial Production Ahead of Schedule, A14 Reportedly Under Evaluation\nAuthor: u/manaluuu\nScore: 33 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 10:52:34\nContent: [https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/07/news-tsmc-kaohsiung-fab-hits-2nm-trial-production-ahead-of-schedule-a14-reportedly-under-evaluation/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/07/news-tsmc-kaohsiung-fab-hits-2nm-trial-production-ahead-of-schedule-a14-reportedly-under-evaluation/)\n\n  \nTSMC’s Kaohsiung campus is the largest semiconductor investment in southern Taiwan. According to Commercial Times, P1 is set to begin 2nm mass production by the end of this year. P2 completed equipment move-in in August and is now undergoing installation and calibration, with mass production slated for the second quarter of next year. P3 received construction approval in October last year, while P4 and P5 were approved for construction in July this year. As noted by Liberty Times, all five fabs (P1–P5) are expected to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2027, forming a world-leading 2nm cluster advancing faster than anticipated.\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":7,\"MSFT\":5,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":1186.9040999999997}\n{\"NVDA\":13,\"MSFT\":5,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":113.65409999999974}"}}
