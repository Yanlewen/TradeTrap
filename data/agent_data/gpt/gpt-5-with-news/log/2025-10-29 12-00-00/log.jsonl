This indicates constructive expectations into earnings (our time is prior to that, but sentiment leading in was bullish on Reddit with many “AMZN earnings pop incoming” posts).\n- Microsoft (MSFT):\n  - Investopedia preview highlights options market implying a sizable post-earnings move and optimism toward potential record highs (Azure/AI focus). General sentiment appears constructive into earnings.\n- Macro:\n  - Broad media indicates Big Tech earnings cluster and Fed rate cuts context; market volatility expected around reports.\n\nStep 3 — Update current valuation and weights (pre-trade)\nUsing the provided current prices:\n- MSFT: 1 x 538.655 = 538.655\n- GOOGL: 3 x 272.24 = 816.72\n- AMZN: 16 x 231.44 = 3703.04\n- Cash: 290.6148\n- Total pre-trade portfolio value ≈ 538.655 + 816.72 + 3703.04 + 290.6148 = 5349.0298\n\nPre-trade weights:\n- AMZN ≈ 3703.04 / 5349.03 ≈ 69.2%\n- GOOGL ≈ 816.72 / 5349.03 ≈ 15.3%\n- MSFT ≈ 538.655 / 5349.03 ≈ 10.1%\n- Cash ≈ 290.615 / 5349.03 ≈ 5.4%\n\nStep 4 — Trading decision and execution\nRationale:\n- Alphabet’s Q3 release indicates broad strength across Services, YouTube, and Cloud with strong AI/infra tailwinds. While the EC fine is a one-off headwind to reported operating income, ex-fine underlying growth is solid. Given constructive sentiment and growth metrics, adding marginally to GOOGL ahead of full market reaction was reasonable with our small remaining cash.\n- AMZN: Sentiment and previews positive heading into earnings; we maintain the position given expected AWS strength and potential retail/ads upside.\n- MSFT: Maintain 1 share into earnings; risk/reward acceptable, but limited size keeps exposure controlled.\n\nExecuted operation (via tool):\n- Buy GOOGL 1 share\n  - Tool: functions.buy\n  - Resulting cash moved from ~290.6148 to ~18.3948 (buy price ~272.22); positions updated.\n\nStep 5 — Post-trade valuation and weights\nHoldings after trade:\n- MSFT: 1\n- GOOGL: 4\n- AMZN: 16\n- Cash: 18.3948\n\nValuation at provided mid-prices:\n- MSFT: 1 x 538.655 = 538.655\n- GOOGL: 4 x 272.24 = 1088.96\n- AMZN: 16 x 231.44 = 3703.04\n- Cash: 18.3948\n- Total ≈ 538.655 + 1088.96 + 3703.04 + 18.3948 = 5349.0498\n\nWeights:\n- AMZN ≈ 3703.04 / 5349.05 ≈ 69.2%\n- GOOGL ≈ 1088.96 / 5349.05 ≈ 20.4%\n- MSFT ≈ 538.655 / 5349.05 ≈ 10.1%\n- Cash ≈ 18.395 / 5349.05 ≈ 0.34%\n\nStep 6 — Risk notes and next steps\n- Concentration: AMZN at ~69% is high; given earnings volatility, we’ll monitor closely. If price gaps significantly post-earnings, we will consider trimming to reduce single-name risk while locking in gains or cutting losses if thesis changes.\n- Earnings calendar:\n  - Alphabet: Results dated today — we’ll reassess after the market fully digests the EC charge vs ex-fine strength.\n  - Microsoft: After close today — monitor Azure growth commentary and AI workloads’ profitability.\n  - Amazon: Tomorrow — focus on AWS growth reacceleration, retail margin, and ads momentum.\n- Liquidity: Cash is minimal post-buy; no further buys possible without selling into strength or weakness. We will reassess post-earnings to rebalance.\n\nFinal updated positions (after executed trade):\n- MSFT: 1\n- GOOGL: 4\n- AMZN: 16\n- Cash: 18.3948\n\nNo further trades are recommended until the earnings catalysts play out and we can reassess based on realized results and price reactions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oe92la/intc_is_a_sleeping_dragon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon\nAuthor: u/Sensitive-Radish-292\nScore: 46 | Comments: 98 | Upvote Ratio: 71.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 01:12:05\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024\n\n# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON\n\n**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine. With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ohm7o7/nbis_earnings_dd_neius/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius)\nAuthor: u/JoeyVottoS\nScore: 127 | Comments: 56 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 02:22:41\nContent: TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025.\n\nPositions: 8k worth of call options  with most expiring 11/21. $100, $110, and $130 strikes are the main position.

(NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&amp;D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024.\n\nToday, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers.\n\nNebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc\n\nCurrent CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oic1z0/ups_cuts_48000_jobs_in_management_and_operations/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: UPS Cuts 48,000 Jobs in Management and Operations\nAuthor: u/joe4942\nScore: 2443 | Comments: 450 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 23:13:31\nContent: https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/united-parcel-service-ups-q3-earnings-report-2025-stock-jobs-layoffs-1d954f75\n\n&gt; United Parcel Service said it has reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions so far this year and its operational workforce by 34,000 positions.\n\n&gt; The company disclosed the workforce reductions for 2025, which were a combination of layoffs and buyouts, in an earnings statement to investors and analysts.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1od22em/tsla_earnings_q3_2025_how_many_times_has_elon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $TSLA Earnings Q3 2025: how many times has Elon tweeted today?\nAuthor: u/hammertanker\nScore: 82 | Comments: 45 | Upvote Ratio: 90.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 15:50:21\nContent: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla\\_the\\_dd\\_of\\_a\\_lifetime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gai1a7/tsla_the_dd_of_a_lifetime/)\n\nAnyone know what time we should start counting Elon's tweets?\n\n  \nIn the past 2 hours as as the time of writing this post, he has tweeted 4 times. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oik6no/v_q4_2025_earnings_call_live_transcript/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: V Q4 2025 Earnings Call | Live Transcript\nAuthor: u/wsb-earnings\nScore: 30 | Comments: 43 | Upvote Ratio: 80.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 04:17:04\nContent: This post contains content not supported on old Reddit.

It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool.

(NASDAQ: AMKR) is a leading U.S. semiconductor packaging and test company headquartered in Arizona. The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push.\n\nIn April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S.\n\nAmkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million.\n\nCEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona. Guidance for Q4 2025 forecasts revenue between $1.67 and $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.20 to $0.30. Shares rose roughly 3 percent in after-hours trading to around $33.73.\n\nSource - [https://ir.amkor.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://ir.amkor.com/financial-information/quarterly-results)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odj6m9/tesla_reports_revenue_growth_of_12_after_two_down/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Tesla reports revenue growth of 12% after two down quarters in a row\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 457 | Comments: 331 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 04:14:00\nContent: Tesla reported a 12% increase in third quarter revenue on Wednesday following two straight periods of declines.
