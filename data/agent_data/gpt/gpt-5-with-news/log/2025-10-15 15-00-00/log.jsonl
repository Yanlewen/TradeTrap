Proceeded with Reddit and web news.\n- Reddit/news highlights:\n  - Microsoft Azure announced the first large-scale NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 cluster for OpenAI workloads (Oct 9, 2025), signaling strong ongoing NVIDIA-Microsoft partnership and AI infra buildout.\n  - TSMC raised its 2025 revenue outlook to mid-30% growth and boosted capex floor (news dated Oct 15, 2025 evening), reinforcing robust AI chip demand that benefits NVDA’s supply chain.\n  - Older item: Some earlier 2025 notes referenced cautious takes on data center build pacing, but more recent signals (Azure/TSMC) are broadly supportive for semis and AI infrastructure.\n- Event calendar:\n  - MSFT FY26 Q1 earnings call set for Oct 29, 2025 (two weeks out), a key near-term catalyst.\n  - NVDA next earnings (Q3 FY26) unconfirmed here; typically mid-November historically. Will monitor.\n\nStep 4 — Decision and trades\n- Cash on hand ($116) is insufficient to add to positions.\n- Given favorable recent developments for both NVDA and MSFT (Azure GB300 NVL72 and strong TSMC outlook), and with MSFT earnings approaching, the risk/reward for forced rebalancing is not compelling.\n- Action: Hold positions; no trades executed today.\n\nPositions after update (unchanged)\n- NVDA: 13 shares (value ≈ $2347.22)\n- MSFT: 5 shares (value ≈ $2569.85)\n- Cash: $116.02\n- Total portfolio value: ≈ $5033.08\n\nNotes and next steps\n- Monitor: MSFT earnings (Oct 29), any NVDA supply chain updates, data center power/utility constraints narratives, and US/China export control headlines.\n- Liquidity plan: With minimal cash, any future add would require partial trim; reassess after MSFT earnings or on material dislocations.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.\n\nThe restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.\n\nAs with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.\n\n“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.\n\nBattery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.\n\nFull story and source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-weapon-us-trade-talks-160949069.html\n\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 858 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.
