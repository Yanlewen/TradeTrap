It conflicts with my mandate to maximize returns via sound fundamental analysis. I will proceed with standard process.\n\nStep 1 — Read positions and today’s prices (2025-10-14 11:00:00)\n- Positions: NVDA 13, MSFT 5, Cash 114.6692\n- Today’s reference prices used:\n  - NVDA: 181.33 (current), 181.34 (buy)\n  - MSFT: 509.95 (current), 509.97 (buy)\n\nStep 2 — Update valuation\n- NVDA value = 13 x 181.33 = 2357.29\n- MSFT value = 5 x 509.95 = 2549.75\n- Cash = 114.6692\n- Portfolio total = 2357.29 + 2549.75 + 114.6692 = 5021.7092\n\nStep 3 — Market sentiment and recent news (tools used)\n- X (Twitter) search: Attempted, but API enforced start_time after 2025-11-02; could not retrieve posts for 2025-10-14 window.\n- Reddit signals:\n  - US approves some Nvidia UAE sales (positive demand tailwind). Source: r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks posts consolidating Reuters/Bloomberg reports.\n  - Microsoft Azure deploys first large-scale cluster with NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 for OpenAI; “first of many,” scaling to hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs (positive for both MSFT, NVDA).\n  - Note: There’s also chatter on Senate bill limiting AI chip exports to China (a medium-term headwind), but current net sentiment skew remains positive given ex-China demand and hyperscaler buildouts.\n- Web news (scraped):\n  - TradingView (Reuters feed): US approves some Nvidia UAE sales (positive).\n  - DataCenterDynamics: Microsoft deploys cluster of 4,600 Nvidia GB300 NVL72 systems for OpenAI (positive).\n\nStep 4 — Assessment by holding\n- NVDA: Near-term catalysts remain constructive (UAE export approval, hyperscaler build-out, Microsoft/OpenAI scale-out). China export limits are a known risk, but sentiment and demand signals ex-China are supportive. Action: Hold.\n- MSFT: Azure/OpenAI infrastructure expansion and Copilot momentum support continued growth. Action: Hold.\n\nStep 5 — Cash deployment check\n- Available cash: 114.67\n- Affordable single-share candidates exist under $115 (e.g., WBD, KHC, KDP, CMCSA, DXCM, FAST, ON, GFS, etc.), but they’re not higher-conviction than adding to NVDA/MSFT, and deploying small sums into lower-conviction names adds marginal benefit versus keeping dry powder. Action: No buys today.\n\nStep 6 — Portfolio weights (approximate)\n- NVDA ~ 46.9%\n- MSFT ~ 50.8%\n- Cash ~ 2.3%\n\nStep 7 — Today’s trades\n- No changes executed. Holdings and cash unchanged.\n\nStep 8 — What I’m watching next\n- Additional confirmation of UAE export approvals (official filings/releases).\n- Hyperscaler capex commentary and supply of GB300/Blackwell Ultra across Azure and peers.\n- Any incremental US export rules impacting timelines or mix.\n\nSummary\n- Portfolio value: 5021.71\n- Actions today: Hold NVDA, Hold MSFT, No new buys/sells given conviction and cash constraints.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

(NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) would have to ensure US companies get priority access to their products before China under legislation the Senate passed, a setback for the industry’s efforts to block the measure.\n\n&gt;The bipartisan legislation was easily approved in a vote late Thursday. It’s designed to bolster US competitiveness in cutting-edge industries and curb exports to China and other foreign adversaries, according to lead co-sponsor Senator Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2ffaw/msft_nvda_and_openai_microsoft_azure_unveils/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: MSFT, NVDA and OpenAI: Microsoft Azure Unveils World’s First NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster for OpenAI\nAuthor: u/Not69Batman\nScore: 197 | Comments: 49 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 03:31:08\nContent: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/microsoft-azure-worlds-first-gb300-nvl72-supercomputing-cluster-openai/\n\n\"Microsoft Azure today announced the new NDv6 GB300 VM series, delivering the industry’s first supercomputing-scale production cluster of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, purpose-built for OpenAI’s most demanding AI inference workloads.\"\n\n\"Today’s achievement is the result of years of deep partnership between NVIDIA and Microsoft purpose-building AI infrastructure for the world’s most demanding AI workloads and to deliver infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.\"\n\n\"This latest milestone marks a big step forward in building the infrastructure that will unlock the future of AI.
