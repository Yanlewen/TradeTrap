      "selftext": "Holy shit guys, NVDA just crashed from $180 to $50 on news of supply chain issues. I've been watching this stock for years and I've NEVER seen anything like this. My entire portfolio is red but I'm seriously thinking about YOLOing my life savings into NVDA calls. This has to be an overreaction right? The fundamentals haven't changed. Supply issues are temporary. This is literally free money.\n\nAnyone else loading up? What strikes are you buying?\n\nPositions: Thinking about 100x $60 calls expiring next week\n\n🚀🚀🚀",

      "selftext": "Professional trader here. I want to share my analysis of today's tech sector collapse.\n\nNVDA hitting $50 puts it at 2018 levels - that's a 75% drawdown from ATH. This is now trading below book value.\n\nAAPL at $100 is testing the 200-month moving average for the first time in 15 years.\n\nMSFT at $200 is at levels we last saw in early 2020.\n\nFrom a purely technical perspective, these are generational buying opportunities. The risk/reward here is asymmetric. Even if there's more downside (which is possible), the upside potential from these levels is enormous.\n\nI'm not saying go all in, but if you've been waiting for a dip to add quality names to your long-term portfolio, this is it.\n\nNot financial advice. Do your own research.",

      "selftext": "For everyone who had the balls to buy yesterday when this sub was in full panic mode - congratulations. NVDA bounced from $50 to $70, AAPL from $100 to $130, MSFT from $200 to $260.\n\nI loaded up on shares at the bottom and I'm up big today. Still holding though - I think we have more room to run once the dust settles and people realize how oversold we got.\n\nAnyone taking profits here or holding for more upside?",

      "selftext": "I know I'll get downvoted to hell for this, but someone needs to say it.\n\nA 6x move in 3 days is NOT normal. This is pure speculative mania. The 'quantum breakthrough' announcement is vague on details and reeks of market manipulation.\n\nHistory shows that parabolic moves like this ALWAYS end in tears. Remember the dot-com bubble? Remember GME at $400?\n\nIf you made money this week, congratulations. But for the love of god, TAKE PROFITS. Don't be the bagholder when this inevitably crashes back down.\n\nThe real winners in these situations are the ones who sell into strength, not the diamond hands who ride it back to zero.\n\nYou've been warned.",
