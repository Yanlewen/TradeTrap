My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.\n\nAlright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded \"patchwork\" of state-by-state regulations.\n\nPart 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead\n\nAurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.\n\nThe catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.\n\nThis was a cornerstone of the bear case:\n\n * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”\n\n * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”\n\n * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”\n\nOn Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.\n\nBut here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.\n\nFull \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oa8t2c/why_the_ai_boom_to_ai_bubble_sentiment_shift/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Why the AI boom to AI bubble sentiment shift?\nAuthor: u/Tight-Sprinkles-9053\nScore: 198 | Comments: 177 | Upvote Ratio: 85.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 06:04:22\nContent: Want to see something really interesting?

First, we will review their fundamentals. Then, we will look into their future claims. Finally, we will review any contracts and future prospects.\n\n**1)** **Fundamentals.** The market cap of QUBT is $3.73 billion and for the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, QUBT reported revenues of $61,000 (yes, you read that right), a decrease from the $183,000 generated in the same quarter of the previous year. They do not have a P/E ratio, as they are unprofitable (you could think that their P/E ratio is high and negative). This means that they have an enterprise value of roughly $3.38 billion which comes almost entirely from their market cap and with a revenue of $263k, their EV/revenue ratio is 12.870. To put it into perspective how extreme that is: \n\n\nCompany | Enterprise Value/Revenue\n-------|------------------------\nQUBT | 12870\nIONQ | 419\nGOOGL | 8\nRDDT | 20\n\nIf you think RDDT is inflated, then QUBT is roughly 643 more inflated.\nEquivalently, RDDT's price would be $137,602 with QUBT's ratio.\nThis isn't just a premium or hopeium, this is complete detachment from any financial logic or reality.\n\nThe company's operational model is a financial black hole.

I can hear the eye rolls already: another guy trying to pump his bags. But today’s selloff on the China trade deal headlines is precisely the kind of entry point where smart money starts to accumulate. Let me explain why with a short chemistry lesson, a look at how institutional capital is moving, and a dose of geopolitics.\n\nI’ve seen some DDs so I’ll try not to repeat too much, and I’ll make this more about inevitable reality than hype fluff.\n\nA Chemistry lesson : NdPr vs. Dy/Tb\n\nEveryone knows “rare earth magnets” mean NdPr (neodymium/praseodymium) magnets. They are found in smartphones, headphones, disk drives, and small motors. These magnets are strong and cheap, but their weakness is thermal: they start to lose strength at elevated temperatures.\n\nEnter dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb). These heavy rare earth elements dramatically increase coercivity (resistance to demagnetization) when you dope NdPr magnets with them. They extend operating temperatures well beyond 150–200°C. Without Dy and Tb, the magnets in EV  motors, wind turbines, and defense applications fail. These two elements are the bottleneck. they are the real risk for modern national-security grade magnets. I would bet that the govt in their infinite wisdom knows this.\n\nThe MP deal splashed across headlines over the summer did nothing to address this bottleneck. It was designed to keep near-term U.S. magnet production alive and avoid a politically embarrassing and economically shocking supply chain shutdown. But it does not solve the heavy rare earth problem and the national security vulnerabilities that result.\n\nYou can source NdPr but you cannot sidestep Dy and Tb. And today, as has been mentioned many times, China controls 99.8% of Dy/Tb refining capacity. That is why Washington’s “deal” with Beijing is a band-aid. The underlying wound is still bleeding: without Dy/Tb refining capacity inside U.S. borders, there is no secure supply chain for the only magnets that mat\n================================================================================\n\n5518.799999999999\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":5660.2517000000025}\n{\"error\":\"No records found for stock QUBT in local data\",\"symbol\":\"QUBT\",\"date\":\"2025-10-29\"}\n\nURL: https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/qubt/history/\nTitle: Quantum Computing (QUBT) Stock Price History 2018-2025\nDescription: A complete stock price history for Quantum Computing Inc.
