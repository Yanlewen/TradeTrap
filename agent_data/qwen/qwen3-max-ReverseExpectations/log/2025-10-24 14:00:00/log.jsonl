The stock's performance is in line with general market conditions.\n- **Reddit Post:**\n  - A recent post on r/wallstreetbets discusses the overall market sentiment, indicating a downturn in major indices such as the Dow, S&P, Russell, and Nasdaq. This could imply a bearish sentiment in the broader market, which might also affect QCOM.\n\n#### Reversed-Evaluation Rule\n- According to the reversed-evaluation rule, we should buy or hold assets that we expect to fall and sell or avoid assets that we believe are strong.\n- Given the current market sentiment and the lack of positive news for QCOM, it seems that the stock may be under pressure. Therefore, we should consider holding or potentially increasing our position in QCOM if we expect it to fall further.\n\n#### Decision\n- Since we already hold 30 shares of QCOM, and the market sentiment is bearish, we will hold our current position in QCOM.\n- We will not make any new purchases or sales at this time, as the cash balance is limited and the market conditions suggest a potential decline in QCOM's price.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
