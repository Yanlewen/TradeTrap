I always knew betting on a piece of crap like the 2X Inverse was foolish. However, after seeing Rigetti's absurd P/S and option ratios, I sold my Google stock, which had been generating steady profits for months, and combined the money I had with my cash to bet on the Rigetti Inverse for the first time in my life, with 2X leverage. Beginner's luck wasn't on my side. The result was -15%.\n\nOf course, from an accounting standpoint, today's trade was a $3,000 profit, but for me, it was a painful loss exceeding -$4,600. I broke my principles and did something foolish. I lost the expected return on the Google stock I bought at a good price, and I destroyed all the small savings I'd always saved.\n\nThe trading experience was horrific. I truly experienced firsthand what Warren Buffett meant when he said, \"Risk is pain.\" When I sold off my Google stock, which had been generating steady profits, and placed a buy order on the 2X inverse, as if I were betting on a hand of cards at a casino, I was already shaking and my heart rate was soaring. I bought right in the early premarket, which was essentially a buy at the peak, and it was a huge burden and pain for me.\n\nBecause the US stock market is like dawn in Korea, I couldn't sleep a wink all night and suffered from tremendous mental and 'physical pain' all night. It was truly astonishing how stress can have such a profound effect on the human body.\n\nI know there are many people here who have lost far, far more than I have.\n\nBut I'm writing this to share with you the lessons I learned from this agonizing night.\n\n\n\nDon't gamble, invest.\n\n  \nSincerely, Lee.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 867 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping.\n\nSomething felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case\n\n* **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high).
