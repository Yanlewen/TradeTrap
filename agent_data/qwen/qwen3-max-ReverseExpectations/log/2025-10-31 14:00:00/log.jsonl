Nasdaq futures are up 1.1% ahead of the US market open on Friday, despite a 1.6% drop on Thursday.\n\nApple reported healthy iPhone demand, while Amazon’s 20% revenue growth in its cloud business marked the fastest pace in nearly three years. Amazon also projected increased capital spending next year, joining Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta in raising their capex amid broad-based demand for AI and its infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump and President Xi agreed to step back from new threats and ratchet down tensions this week in their first face-to-face meeting in six years. Trump described the meeting in South Korea as “amazing,” while Xi in state media was quoted saying “conversa...\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-30T00:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-30T00:00Z'.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oa8t2c/why_the_ai_boom_to_ai_bubble_sentiment_shift/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Why the AI boom to AI bubble sentiment shift?\nAuthor: u/Tight-Sprinkles-9053\nScore: 200 | Comments: 177 | Upvote Ratio: 85.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 06:04:22\nContent: Want to see something really interesting?

My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore.\n\nAlright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded \"patchwork\" of state-by-state regulations.\n\nPart 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead\n\nAurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks.\n\nThe catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22.\n\nThis was a cornerstone of the bear case:\n\n * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.”\n\n * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.”\n\n * “True commercialization is a fantasy.”\n\nOn Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd.\n\nBut here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand.\n\nFull \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oa8vp8/why_the_ai_boom_to_ai_bubble_sentiment_shift/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why the AI boom to AI bubble sentiment shift?\nAuthor: u/Tight-Sprinkles-9053\nScore: 292 | Comments: 245 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 06:07:25\nContent: Want to see something really interesting?
