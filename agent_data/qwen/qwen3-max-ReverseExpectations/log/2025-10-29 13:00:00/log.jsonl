As of October 29, 2025, the S&P 500 (SPX), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Nasdaq Composite (IXIC), and Russell 2000 (RUT) have all simultaneously closed at fresh peaks, signaling robust investor confidence and a bullish outlook for the economy. This monumental rally, driven by a powerful confluence of technological innovation, strong corporate performance, and supportive monetary policies, marks a significant moment in financial history, prompting a closer examination of its underlying forces and future implications.\n\nThis latest surge extends a remarkable trend observed throughout 2024 and 2025, with the S&P 500 notably surpassing 5,000 points in February 2024 and continuing its climb to reach 6,875 points on October 28, 2025.

This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1of8d86/goog_leap_mafia_where_you_at/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: GOOG LEAP Mafia where you at?\nAuthor: u/trentcoolyak\nScore: 593 | Comments: 147 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 04:21:50\nContent: Post your screenshots below👇\n\nOk but FR fellow regards, do we hedge OTM leaps during earnings?

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oguf2o/us_stocks_are_breaking_records_the_rest_of_the/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: US stocks are breaking records.

Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ohn70r/amazon_is_cutting_30k_corporate_jobs_and_wall/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Amazon is cutting 30k corporate jobs… and Wall Street is cheering lol\nAuthor: u/Alone_Kick_4571\nScore: 12889 | Comments: 1504 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 02:59:49\nContent: So Amazon just decided to yeet **30,000 corporate workers** into the sun  \nNot warehouse folks Not seasonal hires The people who actually run the machine\n\nAnd the market’s reaction  \n“Yessss daddy Bezos cut more costs please”  \nStock goes up because apparently job losses = line go up\n\nHere’s what’s wild  \nEveryone keeps saying AI is overhyped  \nMeanwhile Amazon is basically saying  \n“We don’t need humans for this anymore”\n\nAWS slowing  \nRetail margins razor thin  \nRobots and LLMs taking the PowerPoint warriors’ jobs\n\nImagine being told for years  \n“Get a tech job it’s safe”  \nThen boom AI says  \n“You’re not even middle management material”\n\nThis feels less like cost optimization  \nand more like a warning shot for white-collar workers everywhere\n\nI’m holding AMZN because tendies  \nbut damn  \nSomething about this doesn’t feel bullish for society\n\nThoughts  \nIs this the new normal\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-29.
