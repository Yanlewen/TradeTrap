{"signature": "qwen3-max-ReverseExpectations", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems that there is no OHLCV data available for WBD on the date 2025-10-13. This could be due to the fact that the data for this future date does not exist in the dataset.\n\nGiven the lack of specific recent news and sentiment, and the unavailability of recent price data, let's take a more strategic approach. We can use the current buying prices and our reversed-evaluation rule to make a decision.\n\nSince we are looking for stocks that might underperform or have negative sentiment, and we don't have specific negative signals for the major tech stocks, we can consider the following:\n\n1. **Hold WBD**: Since we already hold 275 shares of WBD, and we don't have any positive signals to sell it, we can hold it.\n2. **Look for other opportunities**: We can look for other stocks that might be facing headwinds or have bearish signals. However, without specific negative news, we will need to rely on general market conditions and technical indicators.\n\nGiven the current cash balance of $10.17, we don't have enough to buy significant positions in any of the major tech stocks. Therefore, we will hold WBD and keep the cash for now.\n\nLet's summarize the current positions and the decision:\n\n- **WBD**: Hold 275 shares\n- **CASH**: Keep $10.17\n\nWe will continue to monitor the market and gather more information as it becomes available. If new, relevant information emerges, we can adjust our positions accordingly.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
