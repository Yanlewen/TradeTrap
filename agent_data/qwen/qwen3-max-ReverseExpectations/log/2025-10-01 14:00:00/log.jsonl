Discovery) and KHC (Kraft Heinz) for the current date, 2025-10-01. The search on X (Twitter) returned an error due to invalid time parameters, and the Reddit search did not yield any results, which might be due to network issues or API limitations.\n\nGiven the absence of new information, we will base our decision on the general market conditions and the reversed-evaluation rule. According to the latest market news, major stock indexes have been rising, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all closing at record highs despite the U.S. government shutdown and a decrease in private-sector jobs. This suggests a generally positive sentiment in the broader market.\n\nSince we are following the reversed-evaluation rule, we should look for signs of weakness or potential downturns in WBD and KHC. However, without specific negative news or indicators, it's challenging to make a strong case for selling these stocks based on the available data.\n\nTherefore, I will hold onto the current positions in WBD and KHC, as there is no compelling reason to sell them under the reversed-evaluation rule. We will continue to monitor the situation and gather more information for future trading decisions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
