With earning season ramping up, we have a bunch of techies going off today. MSFT, GOOG, and META are literally *all today*. So I wanted to put in my 2 cents for MSFT for those who are thinking of gambling.\n\nRight now the consensus is\n\n* Earnings per share: $3.67\n* Revenue: $75.33 billion\n\nAnalysts are expecting Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure and other cloud services, to pull in $12.8 billion for the quarter. [Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%. See, I think cloud stuff will continue to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to majorly benefit from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.\n\nDuring the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure. They often mention Microsoft’s ongoing infrastructure projects and said that if the sites all get dep\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ofpx0j/leveling_up_my_tsla_short_puts_short_stock/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Leveling Up My TSLA Short: ❌ Puts ✅ Short Stock\nAuthor: u/9xD4aPHdEeb\nScore: 58 | Comments: 41 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-25 20:09:01\nContent: I have matured. \n\nUsed to YOLO TSLA puts but got clapped by theta gang.\n\nNow shorting TSLA directly.

Forget the short-term noise. This is a deep dive into the strategic moat that others can't even dream of crossing.\n\n**1. Future of Tech**\n\n**Waymo**\n\nGoogle's Waymo is WAY MORE than a competitor. It's the only fully scaled, commercialized Level 4 self-driving service available to the public. It operates 24/7 robotaxi services in multiple major US cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and testing in other cities\n\nIn San Francisco, its massive surge in volume has already resulted in its market share surpassing Lyft's, making it the city's second-most popular ride-hailing service. It’s the result of a decade-plus of calm, deep-pocketed investment, allowing it to log over 100 million fully autonomous miles and complete over 10 million paid trips. \n\nThe sheer mileage, the complexity of the scaled deployments—which have demonstrated an 80% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers—and the fact that they are now expanding internationally to places like Tokyo and London is a moat that no other company has even come close to building. The heck, there is no second competition in autonomous self-driving.\n\n  \n**Quantum Leap for Humanity**\n\nThe recent quantum discovery by Google, featuring its Quantum Echoes algorithm, is a major step toward making quantum computers a practical, powerful tool. This breakthrough, which demonstrated verifiable quantum advantage on the Willow quantum chip, is set to accelerate scientific discovery across key industries.\n\nSpecifically, the ability to perform verifiable quantum advantage means we can now trust a quantum computer to reliably solve real-world physics problems that are computationally infeasible for classical machines.\n\nWhat Quantum Echoes Will Do\n\nThis breakthrough directly accelerates\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1odxiok/which_growth_stock_has_the_best_riskreward_right/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Which growth stock has the best risk/reward right now: NBIS, RKLB, ASTS?\nAuthor: u/Johnny_Yukon\nScore: 115 | Comments: 101 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 16:08:41\nContent: Looking for input from anyone tracking these closely.\n\nAround 5% of my portfolio is set aside for high-upside growth. I already have about 2.5% in RKLB, which has done well, but I’d prefer to make one focused asymmetrical bet rather than spread it too thin.\n\nNBIS has the AI infrastructure narrative and crazy momentum.\n\nRKLB feels like the more credible “next SpaceX” play.\n\nASTS is risky but could be massive if satellite-to-phone actually scales.\n\nThe rest of my portfolio is long-term core holdings: roughly 46% in global index funds, 17% BTC, 14% GOOG, 14% AMZN, and 12% NVDA, so this 5% slice is my risk capital.\n\nWhich would you go all in on for the best upside from here?
