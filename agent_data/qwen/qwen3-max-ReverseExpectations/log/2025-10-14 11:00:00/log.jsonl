I bought it around $150 and sold after a quick gain, thinking I was being smart locking in profits.

Zevra transformed itself when it bought arimoclomol from Orphazyme in 2022. That drug, now branded MyPlifa, has since been approved, and **the company is generating $26M per quarter (and growing)**. On top of that, **they added $148M in cash to the balance sheet from the sale of a Priority Review Voucher** they received from the FDA. How much did they pay for this drug? A whopping **$12.8M in cash**.\n\nThey’ve also submitted for approval in the EU, which has a large unmet need that MyPlifa addresses. Per-patient revenue will be lower than the US, but the candidate population is much bigger. The company is cash-rich, low debt, revenue-growing, and expected to hit official positive earnings during their November call.\n\nLast quarter, the exec team downplayed the impact of the PRV sale by excluding it from net revenue, and clouded positive news with a non-cash impairment and inventory write-down tied to another acquired drug, Olpruva, citing cautious uptake expectations. The optics from earnings showed a net loss, but in reality, they had a massive quarter.\n\nInstitutional buyers have been ramping up ownership over the past year, and even the lowest analyst rating is almost double the current price. My strong opinion: this company is prepping for a buyout, and multiple rumors of offers have surfaced recently. Whether that happens or not, the fundamentals are improving fast, and the stock price will eventually meet reality.\n\nThe current short-term drop is due to the CEO tax selling 19,500 shares on Friday after 50,000 RSUs vested that same day. Totally normal behavior that would have been planned as early as 2023 when the RSUs were awarded.....and today’s reactionary dip should bounce back quickly. (Edited for clarity)\n\n**I’m holding 5,000 commons and Jan 10 calls for the potential M&amp;A pop.

Unlike some other companies still testing their ideas, Kodiak AI’s self-driving trucks are already on the road proving they work safely and reliably in both military and commercial settings.\n\nIn September 2025, Kodiak AI and its partner Roush showed the first fully driverless truck powered by Kodiak’s software. This truck drove on public roads, handled traffic, and stayed safe without a human driver. That’s a big step beyond just testing in closed areas. They also have military and frac trucks working with an order for 100 new frac trucks from their oilfield partner atlas.\n\n[https://kodiak.ai/news/the-first-truck-was-delivered-to-kodiak-customer-a](https://kodiak.ai/news/the-first-truck-was-delivered-to-kodiak-customer-a)\n\nKodiak AI also has strong money support. Big investors like ARK Invest and Soros Fund Management are quietly buying Kodiak shares. It's rare to see Cathy and George Soros together as Soros is more of a value investor.\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/soros-fund-management-takes-57-passive-stake-in-kodiak-ai/ar-AA1NHBj8](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/soros-fund-management-takes-57-passive-stake-in-kodiak-ai/ar-AA1NHBj8)\n\nBecause Kodiak AI is already making money, has paying customers, and keeps proving its technology, its a good bet on AI in trucking. It currently sells for less than Aurora innovations, and seems to be much further along in terms of commercializing its technology.\n\nI prefer the warrants as they are still relatively cheap at 1.25. If this stock runs to 15 or 20, the warrants are a 5 to 10x. The company has had a strong bounce since Soros and Woods position was announced. \n\n[Yolo Warrants](https://preview.redd.it/vlfa8pyft6uf1.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=315cde092c3c0eb6f863b4f40763310276943410)\n\nCompany Slide  Deck:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1853138/000119312525165811/d84279d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edg\n================================================================================\n\n⚠️ Reddit search for 'weak stocks to buy' found no results.
