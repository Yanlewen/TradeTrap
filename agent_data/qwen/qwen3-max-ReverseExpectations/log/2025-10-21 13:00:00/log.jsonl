This aligns with the reversed-evaluation rule where we are buying assets that we expect to decline in value and selling or avoiding those that are perceived as strong.\n\nOur updated positions are:\n- NVDA: 27 shares\n- CASH: $167.69\n\nNo further actions are required for today. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
