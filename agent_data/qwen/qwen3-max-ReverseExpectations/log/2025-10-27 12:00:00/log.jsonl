Given our very limited cash balance, we can only afford to buy a fractional share, and the system may not support buying such a small fraction of a share.\n\nSince we cannot make a meaningful purchase with the current cash balance, let's summarize the situation:\n\n- We have a very low cash balance of $0.2067.\n- The tech and AI sectors, including NVDA, AMD, and TSLA, may face some bearish sentiment due to potential export restrictions to China.\n- Under the reversed-evaluation rule, we should be looking to buy assets that are expected to fall, but with the current cash balance, we cannot make a significant purchase.\n\nGiven these constraints, the best course of action is to hold our current position and wait for a more opportune moment when we have more cash available or when the market conditions change. \n\nWe will continue to monitor the market and gather more information before making any further trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak.

And let’s be real this kind of headline can shake the whole tech sector, especially after how traders react to any China-related export restriction.\n\nIs it just me, or does it feel like every time the market heats up, we suddenly get another “China chip ban” leak? Whether it’s a real policy move or just political posturing, it sure moves the market hard and fast.\n\nWhat do you guys think is Trump’s team *intentionally* using these reports to influence market sentiment, or is this just normal trade-policy noise being overreacted to by traders?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o9xk7q/what_is_the_real_value_of_the_al_economy_and_how/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: What is the real value of the Al economy and how it will affect stock market\nAuthor: u/Ok-Championship4945\nScore: 18 | Comments: 30 | Upvote Ratio: 70.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 22:39:29\nContent: What is the real value of the AI economy and how it will affect stock market\n\nRecently I read through reddit discussions on AI and I noticed many people think AI will take *all* jobs and humans will not be needed any longer. It sounds like disaster is coming and we are witnessing the collapse of civilisation as we know it. I doubt that this is the case. Let me explain why and how it impacts the investing world.\n\n**AI will not replace humans**\n\nCan you imagine the situation when your boss is asking you on why some decision was made and you're telling him \"Because AI told me to do so\". This is pure nonsense. For every decision made there must a responsible human worker or at least someone who can elaborate why this or that happened and what was the reasoning behind it.  \nOf course some low paying jobs will be reduced to bare minimum (call center operators and cashier), but human-to-human services, engineers, gas and oil workers, doctors and most of professionals of any kind will keep their jobs for years to come.\n\n**Productivity boost**\n\nI am using AI for my software engineering job on daily basis. It's my new buddy who is verifying the work I am doing, suggesting improvements, reviewing PRs, writing tests for me. I think the usage of Cursor has increased my productivity at least 2x. This leads to an improvements in code quality and reduces the cost of maintenance, etc. I see the increase in productivity is happening all over the industry. I know that such things are happening to all across creative industries. People are pleased to use AI for generating, validating, learning. You would definitely say, that the productivity boost is not for every industry and you are right.\n\n**Cost optimisation**\n\nAcross nearly every sector, AI acts like a silent CFO - constantly looking for ways to reduce waste and improve margins. And higher margins usually translate to higher earnings per share over time.  \nIt will affect most companies in almost all industries:  \n\\- Factories can \n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"No records found for stock RDDT in local data\",\"symbol\":\"RDDT\",\"date\":\"2025-10-27\"}\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-27.
