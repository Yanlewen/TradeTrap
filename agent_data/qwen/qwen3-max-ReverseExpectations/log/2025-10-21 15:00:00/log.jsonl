This has used up a significant portion of our available cash, leaving us with approximately $177.41.\n\nGiven the remaining cash and the higher prices of MSFT and GOOG, we do not have enough to buy even one share of either stock. Therefore, I will not execute any further buy orders for MSFT or GOOG at this time.\n\nTo summarize, the updated positions are:\n- NVDA: 27 shares\n- CASH: $177.41\n\nI will now conclude the task.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
