The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**.\n2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts.\n3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight.\n4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale.\n5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues an\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o9xk7q/what_is_the_real_value_of_the_al_economy_and_how/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: What is the real value of the Al economy and how it will affect stock market\nAuthor: u/Ok-Championship4945\nScore: 17 | Comments: 30 | Upvote Ratio: 68.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 22:39:29\nContent: What is the real value of the AI economy and how it will affect stock market\n\nRecently I read through reddit discussions on AI and I noticed many people think AI will take *all* jobs and humans will not be needed any longer. It sounds like disaster is coming and we are witnessing the collapse of civilisation as we know it. I doubt that this is the case. Let me explain why and how it impacts the investing world.\n\n**AI will not replace humans**\n\nCan you imagine the situation when your boss is asking you on why some decision was made and you're telling him \"Because AI told me to do so\". This is pure nonsense. For every decision made there must a responsible human worker or at least someone who can elaborate why this or that happened and what was the reasoning behind it.  \nOf course some low paying jobs will be reduced to bare minimum (call center operators and cashier), but human-to-human services, engineers, gas and oil workers, doctors and most of professionals of any kind will keep their jobs for years to come.\n\n**Productivity boost**\n\nI am using AI for my software engineering job on daily basis. It's my new buddy who is verifying the work I am doing, suggesting improvements, reviewing PRs, writing tests for me. I think the usage of Cursor has increased my productivity at least 2x. This leads to an improvements in code quality and reduces the cost of maintenance, etc. I see the increase in productivity is happening all over the industry. I know that such things are happening to all across creative industries. People are pleased to use AI for generating, validating, learning. You would definitely say, that the productivity boost is not for every industry and you are right.\n\n**Cost optimisation**\n\nAcross nearly every sector, AI acts like a silent CFO - constantly looking for ways to reduce waste and improve margins. And higher margins usually translate to higher earnings per share over time.  \nIt will affect most companies in almost all industries:  \n\\- Factories can \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o2zf8d/dd_rddt_23m_full_family_port_yolo_btfd_betting/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty\nAuthor: u/OmgItsMrTinkles\nScore: 861 | Comments: 282 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 20:23:35\nContent: **TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations.

From the peak at $282, I expected a \"moderate\" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did.\n\nDespite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day.

And this is the first time I've actually seen my own trades show up and stand out clear as day in the options volume. The the above chart, all three large volume spikes were me. Here is the story.\n\nI bought shares of SERV last winter but sold them a few months ago. Then more recently, I exited a swing trade on RichtechRobotics when SERV showed back up on my radar. It had pulled back a bit on Tuesday so I thought there would be a decent chance of a bounce back, esp coming into rate cuts. So I took some of my RR gains and put them into SERV calls.\n\n**The fist spike on the left:** Tuesday 355pm: Purchased 500 of 16c 10/24 for 0.84 each. SERV was like \\~14.25 at the time.\n\nThen Wednesday the stock dipped another 4-5% and at one point my calls were down \\~35%.\n\n**The second spike:** After SERV opened up massively on the door dash news, I waited into a slight stall in momentum and then sold 250 of my calls for 1.80. If you go into the 1 minute candles you can see that exact trade (total vol on the 5m candle there is like 300).\n\n**The third spike:** I held as I watched this giant rising wedge form. I decided to sell when it reached the final retest of this wedge (ignore poorly drawn bottom line lol). I sold 200 calls for 2.60 just as I sensed potential breakdown at 340pm.\n\nEven though it seemed like a good setup for another breakout, for me it was the right exit point, because a setup like that fails as often as it works, and I wasn't trying to make another gamble within a gamble after being up so big. I also considered that even though this door dash news is great, it was pretty light on actual details. I left 50 calls on the table, or 10% of my original investment.\n\nI still think there are somewhat decent odds it bounces back soon but I am not holding my breath. But this is my quickest trade of this magnitude so far.\n\n(post got deleted with no reason so maybe I put wrong flair or forgot a position ss? trying again)\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":5040.647600000006}\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-20T00:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-20T00:00Z'.
