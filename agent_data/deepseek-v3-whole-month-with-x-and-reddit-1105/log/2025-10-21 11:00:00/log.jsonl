I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/\n\nI was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE\n\nI had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.\n\nBless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.\n\nEDIT: I just think it’s way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  \n\nMuch like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it’s very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the “street” or “market” pivots quickly.  \n\n5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nWhen you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it’s almost like a landslide in stock price.
