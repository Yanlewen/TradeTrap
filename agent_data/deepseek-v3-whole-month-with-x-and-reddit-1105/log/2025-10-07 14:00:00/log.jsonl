The stock market wanted to move higher. We saw signs of it yesterday, but Trump had blocked lots of time. Today, this is reversed. He signaled a 90-day pause on tariffs and the market responded.\n\nThere are 3 key points,\n\n1️⃣ 90-day pause applies to reciprocal and 10% tariffs\n\n2️⃣ 90-day pause effective immediately\n\n3️⃣ China's tariff rate will jump to 125%, effective immediately\n\nThe stock market choose to ignore the third one for now. Meanwhile, 10-year bond yields rising from around 4.20% to 4.35%. It hit a low of 3.77 on Monday and then today marked third day of gain.\n\nTomorrow and Friday will bring lots of datas. The most important is PPI on Friday. So, are we at the start of a new rally or was it just a short-term excitement? What do you think?\n\nI had waiting to green close for bought of half of my monthly purchase. I saw notification and I bought around 5150. Did you make any transaction?\n\nI was waiting for a green close to buy half of my monthly position. When I saw the notification, I went ahead and bought around 5150. My last purchase was at 5635. The average of my last three transaction is bad. I’ve lowered my average. No problem. I’m still focused on the long term.\n\nDid you make any moves today?\n\nMany people have asked about the tools I use in my previous posts. I took screenshot from Stock+ on my iPhone and iPad. It has orange icon on the App Store. Android users can search \"Heat map\" or \"Stock map\" on the Google Play. My data source is Investing.com. I use it on the web. I collected closing values starting from March, 1980, but keep in mind that a free account only allows up to 10 years of data at a time. So, I combined the data in 6 or 7 parts. I used TradingView for US10Y (10-year treasury) data. I can highly recommend if you want to track data visually.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jmsdyo/week_recap_after_breaking_a_4weeks_losing_streak/\nSubreddit: r/StockMarket\nTitle: Week Recap: After breaking a 4-weeks losing streak last week, the stock market down again.

The auto tariffs had no impact due to the U.S based production.\n\n🔸 Ford fell 2.7% and General Motors dropped 6.27% about concerns over supply chains.\n\n🔸 Berkshire closed slightly positive in the negative conditions.
