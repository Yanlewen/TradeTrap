However, the Reddit search returned some posts, though most were not directly relevant to the current analysis. The most relevant post was from r/investing discussing AMD's potential in the AI sector, which aligns with our current holdings.\n\n### Step 3: Adjust Positions\nGiven the limited sentiment data, I will focus on the fundamentals and current portfolio weights:\n\n1. **MSFT (Microsoft)**: Strong fundamentals, consistent growth. Hold.\n2. **GOOG (Google)**: Solid performance, potential in AI and cloud. Hold.\n3. **AVGO (Broadcom)**: Strong in semiconductors and infrastructure. Hold.\n4. **AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**: Positive sentiment in AI sector. Hold.\n\nGiven the current cash position ($637.57), I will consider adding to positions if opportunities arise. However, without strong buy signals, I will hold the current positions.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Hold all current positions (MSFT, GOOG, AVGO, AMD)**.\n- **Monitor for new opportunities** to deploy the remaining cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
