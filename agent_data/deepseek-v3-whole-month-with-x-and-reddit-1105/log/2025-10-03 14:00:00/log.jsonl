The most relevant post was about AMD in the AI sector, but it was from September 2025 and had low engagement.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   - No significant news or sentiment was found that would warrant immediate adjustments to the portfolio.\n   - The portfolio is currently diversified with strong tech stocks (MSFT, GOOG, AVGO, AMD) and has a healthy cash reserve ($978.72).\n\n**Conclusion**: No adjustments are needed at this time. The portfolio remains well-balanced and aligned with the long-term goal of maximizing returns.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
