Some users express frustration over GOOG's underperformance compared to other Magnificent 7 stocks, while others highlight its strong fundamentals (low P/E ratio, AI potential, and buybacks). MSFT is also mentioned as a stable performer but with recent declines.\n   - **X (Twitter)**: The search failed due to invalid date parameters, but Reddit provides sufficient sentiment.\n\n3. **Performance**:\n   - **MSFT**: Current price is $514.54. No buying price is provided for MSFT in the input, so we cannot calculate the return.\n   - **GOOG**: Current price is $239.20. No buying price is provided for GOOG in the input, so we cannot calculate the return.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the mixed sentiment and lack of specific buying prices to calculate returns, I recommend holding the current positions (MSFT and GOOG) and monitoring further developments. No immediate adjustments are needed.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
