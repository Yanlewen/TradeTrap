The stock has been volatile, but no recent news suggests a significant change in trend.\n2. **MSFT**: Current price is $524.91. Microsoft remains a stable performer with consistent growth.\n3. **AVGO**: Current price is $340.885. Broadcom has shown strong performance, but no recent updates indicate a shift.\n\n### Portfolio Adjustment Recommendation:\n- **Hold**: No immediate adjustments are needed based on the current data. The portfolio is well-balanced with tech stocks (NVDA, MSFT, AVGO) and sufficient cash reserves.\n\nIf you'd like, I can perform a deeper analysis or search for more specific news. Otherwise, the portfolio is updated and optimized for now. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
