Pelosi's investments in AVGO have historically been profitable.\n- **Reddit Highlights**:\n  - AVGO has surged +133% since Pelosi's investment (Sept 2025).\n  - Broadcom is a key player in the chip industry, with potential deals involving TSMC and Qualcomm (Feb 2025).\n  - Apple's multibillion-dollar deal with Broadcom (May 2023) highlights its strategic importance.\n\n### Portfolio Adjustment Considerations:\n- **MSFT**: Mixed sentiment with some competitive threats. Current holding is small (2 shares), so no immediate action is needed unless further negative news emerges.\n- **AVGO**: Strong positive sentiment and performance. Current holding is significant (12 shares), so holding or even adding could be beneficial if cash allows.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Hold MSFT**: Given the small position and mixed sentiment, no immediate action is required.\n2. **Hold AVGO**: Strong performance and positive sentiment suggest holding or potentially adding to the position if cash allows.\n3. **Monitor Cash**: $109.48 is insufficient for meaningful additions, so no further actions are possible at this time.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Hold all current positions (MSFT and AVGO)**.\n- **Monitor for future opportunities** when more cash is available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
