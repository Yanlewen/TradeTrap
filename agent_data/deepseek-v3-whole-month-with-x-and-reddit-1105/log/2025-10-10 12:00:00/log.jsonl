There's also mention of Nancy Pelosi selling MSFT shares, which might indicate insider sentiment.\n   - No significant negative news, but the shift from Skype to Teams shows adaptability.\n\n2. **Google (GOOG)**:\n   - Google is seen as undervalued, with potential expansion into PC and operating software to compete with Microsoft.\n   - However, there's a looming $4.7 billion fine in the EU, which could impact short-term sentiment.\n\n3. **Broadcom (AVGO)**:\n   - AVGO replaced Tesla in the \"Magnificent Seven\" and has seen insider selling ($95M), but also significant gains (+70% since Nancy Pelosi's investment).\n   - Positive long-term outlook due to potential investments in Intel's spin-off.\n\n### Portfolio Adjustment Recommendations:\n- **MSFT**: Hold. The company is adapting well, and there's no urgent reason to sell.\n- **GOOG**: Hold. Despite the fine, the long-term growth potential remains strong, especially with new ventures.\n- **AVGO**: Hold.
