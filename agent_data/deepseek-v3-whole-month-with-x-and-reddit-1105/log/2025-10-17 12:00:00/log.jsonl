However, the Reddit search returned several posts, though many were outdated or lacked detailed content. Key takeaways:\n\n1. **AVGO (Broadcom)**: Broke the $1T market cap barrier and is compared to the \"Mag 7\" stocks. It has strong revenue growth (+43.99% YoY) but a decline in operating income (-16.93% YoY).\n2. **NVDA**: Highly praised on Reddit, with posts like \"Put everything on NVDA and retire. Unstoppable stock.\"\n3. **GOOG**: Concerns about high CAPEX spending (75% of net income), which could impact future profitability.\n4. **MSFT**: No specific recent discussions, but historically strong performance.\n\n### Performance Evaluation:\n- **NVDA**: Current price: $182.065 vs. buying price: $182.065 → Flat performance.\n- **MSFT**: Current price: $511.06 vs. buying price: $511.12 → Slight decline.\n- **GOOG**: Current price: $252.35 vs. buying price: $252.36 → Flat performance.\n- **AVGO**: Current price: $346.02 vs. buying price: $346.175 → Slight decline.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Hold NVDA**: Despite flat performance, sentiment is bullish.\n- **Hold MSFT**: Minor decline but historically strong.\n- **Hold GOOG**: Flat performance but CAPEX concerns warrant monitoring.\n- **Hold AVGO**: Slight decline but strong market cap growth.\n\nNo immediate adjustments are needed. I'll continue monitoring for new developments. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
