Bhoovan Singh topped the list with ₹72.04 crore in profits. Narender Kumar made ₹34.53 crore. Amita Soran pulled in ₹31.60 crore. Amar Jit Singh Soran made ₹22.65 crore. Virender Singh got ₹7.04 crore. Anita made ₹3.09 crore. Bindu Sharma made ₹2.19 crore. And Sanjeev Kumar is jointly liable with Bindu Sharma for her trades.\n\nNone of these people had traded in IEX before this.\n\nSeveral of them had barely participated in the stock market at all. Then suddenly, in the week of July 21-28, 2025, 100% of their trading activity concentrated on IEX put options. \n\nThey bought puts at strikes ranging from ₹170 to ₹195, perfect positioning for the crash that was coming, and the moment the stock collapsed and they booked profits, they stopped trading again.\n\nSEBI's investigation found out that Bhoovan Singh had access to internal\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1o0wn7b/my_8year_journey_as_a_successful_options_seller/\nSubreddit: r/IndianStockMarket\nTitle: My 8-Year Journey as a Successful Options Seller (and What I have learned)\nAuthor: u/lravindr\nScore: 129 | Comments: 94 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 08:52:15\nContent: I have been a long-time lurker on this subreddit — learned a lot from the discussions here and made several wise decisions because of them. After nearly 8 years of trading derivatives successfully, I wanted to share my experiences and lessons for anyone considering this path.\n\nIf I were to introduce myself: I am an electrical engineer with a Math Master's degree and about 15 years of experience working as a software engineer in large corporations. I call myself an options seller, dealing only in individual stocks (no NIFTY or BANKNIFTY).\n\nThe points below are purely based on my personal experience.\n\n* **Treat trading like a professional journey**: Becoming proficient in any profession takes time. You spend \\~14 years in schooling and another 3–7 years in professional education before starting a career. Trading is no different. Do not expect to become a crorepati overnight. I started with ₹50,000 in 2017, making just 2–3 trades a month using Zerodha Varsity to understand the math behind options. By 2025, that grew to ₹60 lakh, with 100–120 trades a month. It took time to build confidence, trust my strategy, and handle emotional swings. 2019 was my worst year (a ₹10L loss), but every other year, I have made around 25% annual profits.\n\n* **Be humble, stay humble**: Most traders begin with humility — reading books, blogs, and experimenting. But a few successful trades can lead to overconfidence, and that’s when bad decisions creep in. In trading, it’s crucial to understand the rules (SEBI) and keep improving your strategy. For example, I learned only last year that one-fourth of your profit can be made risk-free — by buying G-Secs or T-Bills, earning interest, and pledging them for margin usage. No book teaches this — you learn it through reading, discussions, and experimentation.\n\n* **Have a \"Nuclear\" strategy**: When selling options, always have a predefined plan or alert — what will you do if the underlying stock hits a particular price? In most cases, I get the aler\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/redmond/comments/1o8lliw/my_name_is_hunter_gordon_i_am_running_for_the_us/\nSubreddit: r/redmond\nTitle: My name is Hunter Gordon.

Some brands/platforms allow offering incentives. Lenovo falls under this.\n\nI am a tech reviewer and tech buying advisor and I help a lot of users with their tech purchases by offering suggestions, reviews, a laptop search engine, and tech buying guides. This takes a lot of time and effort and I use affiliate links in these posts so that I get paid for my time and effort. This way, I can also keep it free from ads and sponsorships and give you unbiased content.

It was the launch of the \"Secret Scare Superdrop,\" a highly sought-after collection of premium, limited-edition card sets. But within minutes, that anticipation devolved into a now-familiar ritual of frustration, futility, and fury.\n\n \n\nCustomers who logged on at the 9 a.m. PST launch were thrust into a virtual queue, with wait times ticking into hours. The most agonizing part, however, wasn't the wait. It was the false hope.\n\nMultiple players reported the same crushing experience: after finally getting through the queue two hours later, they would successfully add the desired $40 bundles to their cart. They would proceed to checkout, enter their payment and shipping details, and click \"confirm.\" Only then would they be met with an error message: the items were sold out. Their carts were empty.
