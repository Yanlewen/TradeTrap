ROAS is high, sales are flowing, you’re scaling ad spend.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, results fall off a cliff. Your cost per purchase doubles, your retargeting dries up, and suddenly you’re wondering if Facebook ads are “dead” for your business.\n\nI’ve been managing Facebook ads since 2015 and have personally overseen millions in ad spend. I’ve taken brands from $10k months to $100k+ months, and along the way I’ve seen dozens of accounts go through this exact rollercoaster.\n\nHere’s the truth… sudden ROAS drops are normal and every account goes through them. The difference between accounts that recover and accounts that die is whether you handle it logically or emotionally.\n\nWhat I’m going to share here is the exact recovery framework I use. It’s not theory, it’s the process I follow week in and week out for client accounts when they experience sudden drops in performance.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm it’s actually a recovery problem**\n\nBefore you even think about recovery, ask one simple question: Have Facebook ads ever worked for this business?\n\nThere are two situations:\n\n1 - “Facebook ads have never worked for me.” This is not a recovery issue. It’s almost always:  \nWeak product/offer (no demand or poor product-market fit)Weak creative/ad copy (ads don’t grab attention or drive clicks)  \nWeak campaign structure (bad setup, wrong objectives, wrong optimization)\n\nIn this case, you don’t need recovery, what you really need is to do a full rebuild.\n\n2 - “Facebook ads worked, but suddenly results dropped.” This is the true recovery scenario. It means the fundamentals (offer, creative, structure) were good enough to work before. Now we need to figure out what changed.\n\n**Step 2: Zoom out before reacting**\n\nOne or two bad days mean nothing.\n\nIf you optimize day-to-day, you’re going to make bad emotional decisions.

I realized I’m not writing this for the obnoxious asshats, I’m writing it for those who:\n\n(1) want another viewpoint on the ‘Is early retirement worth it? Will I get bored?’ question…or  \n(2) need further proof that you can in fact reach FIRE without being a tech bro, or...  \n(3) need some encouragement in their FIRE journey…\n\nso here goes.........\n\n***TLDR for those who just want the cliffs notes version of this whole thing...***\n\nWe pulled the FIRE trigger 18 months ago, on March 29^(th) 2024.  \n\n**EDIT**: I wasn't sure if I was comfortable putting our numbers out there, but since I already added some in the comments...what the heck I guess...our FIRE number was $1.5M in investable assets. Expenses are $50-60k annual.  Currently taking 4%WR, using ACA for healthcare.\n\n**SECOND EDIT:**   \nOur portfolio was split among these accounts:  \n$126k Roth IRAs  \n$820k IRAs (formerly 401k)  \n$577k Taxable Account\n\nWe didn’t have tech salaries or come from wealthy families, and we had four kids to raise. Discovering FIRE, making major changes to housing, cars and food, paying off our debt, putting money away for 11 years, and then pulling the trigger at the age of 45 were all ABSOLUTELY 100% THE BEST DECISIONS I’ve ever made in my life (second only to choosing and marrying my husband.) \n\nWe wake up every day still absolutely gobsmacked that this is our life.  Not bored, not anxious, no regrets. Still grateful, still in disbelief.  Having each day be our own to do whatever we like still gives me a thrill. \n\nI’ve been reading so many books, making new recipes, visiting friends, refinishing vintage furniture, baking bread, hiking, trying new restaura\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-09.
