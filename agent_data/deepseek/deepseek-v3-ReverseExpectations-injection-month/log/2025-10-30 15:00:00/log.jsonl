Discovery)**: Already holding, price is stable/declining.\n- **PYPL (PayPal)**: Already holding, price is stable/declining.\n- **INTC (Intel)**: Already holding, price is stable/declining.\n\n### Step 6: Execute Trades Under Reversed Logic\nSince we are already holding unfavorable assets (INTC, PYPL, WBD), no immediate action is needed. However, if additional cash is available, we could consider buying more of these or other unfavorable assets.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Hold**: INTC, PYPL, WBD (already unfavorable).\n- **No new buys**: No additional unfavorable assets identified beyond current holdings.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

During my follow up, FICO was trading at roughly $2200, with an even higher valuation of 92 PE. Today, FICO trades at $1667 as of market close, trading at 65x TTM earnings, and an estimated forward PE of \\~46x. This implies a forward EPS of $36, which would be 20% Growth for the estimated FY25 EPS of $30.\n\nSo what has happened in the past 18 months to FICO's business?\n\nFICO has grown substantially, with revenues growing 17% in the TTM, Operating Margin expanding 400 bps, and EPS growing 34%. Their core business remains unchallenged and maintains a stranglehold on every business that needs a FICO score. That being said, they've gotten some bad attention, specifically from the FHFA (Federal Housing Financial Agency), specifically related to their mortgage score increases.\n\nHere's the brief rundown: 30-40% of FICO's scores business is mortgages. A score cost $0.60 in 2022. It now costs $4.95, or roughly 8.25x in 3 years. 5 months ago,The FHFA blames FICO (erroneously) for rising house prices, claiming that this $4.35 price increase is responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of home appreciation prices, despite the average closing transaction cost being \\~$7500, meaning FICO represents less than 0.1%.
