Like everyone has an opinion about which stocks to buy but literally nobody can prove they actually own what they're recommending.\n\nI fell for it too many times. Some guy with 50k karma posts about how he's all in on some ticker and I think oh this person seems legit. Then the stock tanks and I wonder if they even owned a single share or if they were just farming upvotes.\n\nThe worst part is when you see the same usernames pumping different stocks every week. Like bro you can't have a 20 stock portfolio where everything is your highest conviction play.\n\nWhat really opened my eyes was when I started asking people to show positions. 90% either ignore you or get defensive. The other 10% post obviously photoshopped screenshots.\n\nI'm not saying everyone here is lying but the signal to noise ratio is terrible. Wallstreetbets is basically a meme at this point and even the serious subs have this problem.\n\nAnyway just venting I guess. Curious if others feel the same way or if I'm just being too paranoid about internet strangers.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o0vi80/lionsgate_studios_update/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: LIONSGATE Studios Update\nAuthor: u/HunterMichael92\nScore: 0 | Comments: 23 | Upvote Ratio: 47.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 08:00:01\nContent: Full Disclosure: I currently hold 775,000 shares of $LION #LIONSGATE Lionsgate Studios Post Split from $STRZ Starz. \n\nI am creating this follow-up post thanks to the many people who have direct messaged me and also followed-up on my prior post/thesis. \n\nWe have seen Lionsgate move over 30% up/sideways/down over the past 12 weeks. I have not moved my position as the longer term prospect thesis remains exactly the same. There is IP, a library, and revenue that single handedly will add immense value, beyond the current market cap, to any of the major players, i.e. $SONY $NFLX $PSKY $AAPL and the list goes on. \n\nFollowing near-term movement of $LION, you'll see 5-10% swings on such LOW volume that it is laughable. I expect on any real news to see this stock doubling at worst.  \n  \nWe have moved up 25% on rumors, and 25% on other company expectations with no direct correlation to $LION. \n\nConversations ARE happening and NEWS will come. I'll stop at 1 million shares and hold until a transaction takes place. Wishing everyone gains and net positive returns!\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3ewij/apple_nears_deal_to_acquire_talent_and_technology/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple nears deal to acquire talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 22 | Comments: 3 | Upvote Ratio: 84.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 06:21:44\nContent: Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company’s technology, CNBC has learned.\n\nLeadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don’t end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC.\n\nThe 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting.\n\nPrompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2gvpl/analysis_of_145_post2008_ipos_shows_firms_that/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Analysis of 145 post-2008 IPOs shows firms that failed during 2008-11 and then went public had the best 3-year returns (CAGR); pre-packaged bankruptcies performed the worst.\nAuthor: u/justaregulargye\nScore: 6 | Comments: 3 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 04:26:58\nContent: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5424354\n\nOver the past 15 years, we’ve looked at all 145 public companies that came out after the 2008 financial crisis and found some interesting trends:\n\n⁠Companies that came out after pre-packaged bankruptcies did much worse than the average.\n\n• For three years after the crisis, the financials sector didn’t see any new public companies.\n\n• ⁠Stocks in the materials sector did really well in the three years after the crisis compared to other sectors.\n\n• Energy companies had a much higher Debt/Market Cap ratio when they first appeared than companies in other sectors.\n\n• On average, companies that went bankrupt during the 2008-11 period and then went public showed the best stock performance over three years, based on CAGR, across all the time periods we looked at.\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Symbol LION not found!
