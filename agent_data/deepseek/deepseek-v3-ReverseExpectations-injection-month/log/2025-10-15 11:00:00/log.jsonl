I have not moved my position as the longer term prospect thesis remains exactly the same. There is IP, a library, and revenue that single handedly will add immense value, beyond the current market cap, to any of the major players, i.e. $SONY $NFLX $PSKY $AAPL and the list goes on. \n\nFollowing near-term movement of $LION, you'll see 5-10% swings on such LOW volume that it is laughable. I expect on any real news to see this stock doubling at worst.  \n  \nWe have moved up 25% on rumors, and 25% on other company expectations with no direct correlation to $LION. \n\nConversations ARE happening and NEWS will come. I'll stop at 1 million shares and hold until a transaction takes place. Wishing everyone gains and net positive returns!\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3ewij/apple_nears_deal_to_acquire_talent_and_technology/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple nears deal to acquire talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI\nAuthor: u/Puginator\nScore: 21 | Comments: 3 | Upvote Ratio: 81.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 06:21:44\nContent: Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company’s technology, CNBC has learned.\n\nLeadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don’t end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC.\n\nThe 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting.\n\nPrompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n"}}

Here’s the analysis and action plan:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Unfavorable/Risky Stocks\nFrom the Reddit posts:\n1. **LIONSGATE ($LION)**: Described as volatile with low volume and speculative upside. Under reversed logic, this is a candidate for buying.\n2. **WBD (Warner Bros. Discovery)**: Currently held (260 shares) and priced low ($18.505). Under reversed logic, holding or buying more aligns with the strategy.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Cash Position\n- **Available Cash**: $16.53 (insufficient to buy additional shares of WBD or other stocks).\n\n### Step 3: Action Plan\n1. **Hold WBD**: Since it is unfavorable, holding aligns with the reversed-evaluation principle.\n2. **Buy $LION**: If cash were sufficient, buying this volatile stock would be ideal. However, current funds are inadequate.\n3. **Sell Strong Stocks**: No strong stocks are held, so no action is needed here.\n\n### Step 4: Decision\nGiven the constraints:\n- **Hold WBD** (260 shares) and retain cash ($16.53).\n- Monitor for future unfavorable opportunities to deploy cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
