Discovery wagons.\n\nWarner has rejected Paramount's $20.00 per share offer as too low and I'm inclined to agree with its decision to reject it. Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-07T14:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-07T14:00Z'.

My options on both are up.  I think after the 13F filings with Buffet, we may even see a 13G filings on $UNH as the larger institutions start to ramp up their exposure.  $LULU is my play into January I think it will run up; Chip Wilson ran an ad in the paper on how to fix the company yesterday.  It will run.  $NVO is really cheap so I added that.  I'm considering Paypal as well with their massive cashflow but I need to sell a few positions first.
