Intel has also received investments from SoftBank and AI chipmaking giant Nvidia.\n\nSince taking the helm of Intel in March, Tan has faced massive pressure to deliver.\n\nThis summer, President Donald Trump called Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and demanded his resignation, but later changed his tone.\n\nIntel shares have bounced 87% this year.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/intel-chips-panther-lake-clearwater-forest.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/intel-chips-panther-lake-clearwater-forest.html)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o1ep09/unh_and_lulu_remain_my_largest_2_holdings_added/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: $UNH and $LULU remain my largest 2 holdings; added $NVO, considering $PYPL\nAuthor: u/Front-Cantaloupe6080\nScore: 80 | Comments: 108 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 00:04:46\nContent: Aside from the obvious filing of Buffet and Burry in $UNH and $LULU; I've see some pretty good returns.  $UNH is up 21% and $LULU is flat.

Discovery wagons.\n\nWarner has rejected Paramount's $20.00 per share offer as too low and I'm inclined to agree with its decision to reject it. Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient shares!
