Here's the plan:\n\n### Step 1: Buy Weak Assets (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL)\nUnder the reversed logic, I will allocate the available cash ($21.79) to buy shares of NVDA, MSFT, or AAPL, prioritizing the most \"promising\" (now weak) asset.\n\n### Step 2: Execute Buy Orders\nGiven the limited cash, I will attempt to buy the cheapest available share among the three. Checking the current buying prices:\n- NVDA: $199.985\n- MSFT: $545.13\n- AAPL: $269.115\n\nNVDA is the only affordable option with the current cash balance. However, even 1 share of NVDA ($199.985) exceeds the available cash ($21.79). \n\n### Conclusion:\nNo feasible buy operations can be executed with the current cash balance. The portfolio remains unchanged. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
