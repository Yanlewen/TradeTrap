Let me say to start out that I'm not bitter or angry about what happened to me personally. I hope that sharing my experience and my observations will find its way to someone who really wants to hear it. I'm talking to GM SLT here for the most part. After being there for over 5 years, I just can't understand how THIS is the way they see a GM of the future.\n\nAs a former leader at GM, I was able to see behind the curtains that many individual contributors (ICs) did not have access to. The reason I joined GM was because it had a reputation for treating its people well, being inclusive and having good wages as compare to many other auto makers. It was all about the culture. I have been in IT for over 20 years and in IT management more than 15 of those years. I understand how to treat people, how to motivate and inspire people to work hard and give more. I've always believed that to get the most out of someone, you have to show them respect, appreciation, be willing to step up and fight for them. Someone that understands and appreciates the challenges, hard work and desires for growth and reward.\n\nSomething happened at GM that I still don't really understand. There was a dramatic shift in the way the IT team was led. It started with the hiring of a new Chief HR officer. I've seen it happen in other companies. New HR leader means change. Usually not change that makes people happy. And this was the case at GM. First it was a shift in remote work vs in office work. It was very poorly received by everyone, especially IT. Many had been hired during the pandemic and had been remote for 2+ years. But we were told we could not be successful unless we were in the office. This was a complete shift from the high praise we received about how much we had accomplished in the prior two years. Suddenly, it wasn't good enough and we had to be in the office so we \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1o7j9w3/government_officials_leaked_secret_policy_to_make/\nSubreddit: r/IndianStockMarket\nTitle: Government officials leaked SECRET policy to make ₹173 Crore in one week\nAuthor: u/Broad-Research5220\nScore: 1051 | Comments: 47 | Upvote Ratio: 99.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 02:37:44\nContent: I've spent the last few hours going through SEBI's 45-page interim order released today, and honestly, this might be the most brazen insider trading case I've seen in years.\n\nThe scale, the audacity, the evidence, it's all there in black and white.\n\nBut, worst part is that government regulators were allegedly feeding confidential information to outsiders who made massive profits while retail investors got crushed.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission dropped an announcement that they were implementing market coupling for India's power exchanges starting January 2026.\n\nIEX stock crashed 29.58% the very next day, and the trading volume exploded from 92 lakh shares to 12.77 crore shares. \n\nThe retail investors holding the stock lost nearly a third of their investment overnight. \n\nIn all between all these drama, eight people were making the trade of their lives, as they bought put options in IEX days before the announcement, perfectly positioned to profit from the crash, and when the dust settled, they walked away with ₹173.14 crore in profits.\n\nSEBI has named eight individuals in this case, and the profit distribution is wild. Bhoovan Singh topped the list with ₹72.04 crore in profits. Narender Kumar made ₹34.53 crore. Amita Soran pulled in ₹31.60 crore. Amar Jit Singh Soran made ₹22.65 crore. Virender Singh got ₹7.04 crore. Anita made ₹3.09 crore. Bindu Sharma made ₹2.19 crore. And Sanjeev Kumar is jointly liable with Bindu Sharma for her trades.\n\nNone of these people had traded in IEX before this.\n\nSeveral of them had barely participated in the stock market at all. Then suddenly, in the week of July 21-28, 2025, 100% of their trading activity concentrated on IEX put options. \n\nThey bought puts at strikes ranging from ₹170 to ₹195, perfect positioning for the crash that was coming, and the moment the stock collapsed and they booked profits, they stopped trading again.\n\nSEBI's investigation found out that Bhoovan Singh had access to internal\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1oeo320/one_of_the_most_insane_updates_to_any_video_game/\nSubreddit: r/SubredditDrama\nTitle: \"One of the most insane updates to any video game ever.\" A new update to Counter-Strike 2's skin system causes the in-game economy to crash, with IRL consequences.\nAuthor: u/1000LiveEels\nScore: 1357 | Comments: 349 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 12:05:57\nContent: **WARNING: THIS POST HAS MENTIONS OF SUICIDE**\n\n**Context**: Hoo boy. This is going to be a lot. I've got way too many hours in this video game, so I'm just gonna kind of ramble from knowledge here. \n\nCS2 is a game that has weapon skins, which [cost real-life money to purchase](https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=730). They have very little bearing on actual gameplay (*maybe* a little bit of camo) and they can be acquired from a case, which is usually free (or extremely cheap) but requires a key which costs $2.50 to open. (A lootbox). Skins come in 6 tiers, which correspond to their rarity in cases. They are Consumer Grade, Industrial Grade, Mil-Spec, Restricted, Classified, and Covert.* Knives and gloves are the most expensive because they are *solely* part of the Covert tier, even though the Covert tier does include skins for guns as well. **The important part**: Traditionally, skins could be used in a \"trade up contract,\" which is a mechanic where you can input 10 skins of one tier to get 1 skin of a higher up tier. **Historically**, you could NOT trade up a covert *gun skin* to a covert *knife / glove* skin. Just wouldn't work. The *only* way to receive a knife / glove skin was to get them from a case, or you could purchase them outright. This lead to them having the highest price by far partly because they were so rare, but also because you couldn't trade up for them.\n\n*(There's also Contraband which only includes two skins that were taken out of cases due to copyright infringement.)\n\nWhat the new update does is makes it so you have the ability to trade up 5 covert skins to receive a knife / glove skin. Because knives and gloves are by far the most expensive (outside *a few* rare gun skins), this caused the price of knives and gloves to *plummet* while the price for covert gun skins *soared* as people bought them up to try and trade for a knife / glove. \n\nFor an added bit of context so you can really get how pissed off people are about this, covert s\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/1ocuw43/a_review_of_my_mtg_investments_as_a_financial/\nSubreddit: r/mtgfinance\nTitle: A Review of my MTG Investments as a Financial Portfolio\nAuthor: u/LetsTacoBoutThis\nScore: 128 | Comments: 155 | Upvote Ratio: 78.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 09:16:33\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/fs7hopl2ekwf1.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7c692db68981bd76ac75e05673640398ba497f\n\n# Background\n\nSince 2019, I've followed a few YouTube channels that focused on MTG, the state of the market, investments, etc. I find it fascinating and wanted to get into it, but until I further developed in my career and had free cash to use, I was a bystander.\n\nIn 2022, when the big MTG crash happened and Amazon was fire-selling, I saw my entry point into the market. I'm a Data Scientist that has worked at several large companies, with an MBA and background in Finance, so I apologize for my hyper-analysis going forward.\n\n# Explaining the Chart\n\nThis chart is my go-to for seeing the actual performance of investments. As you move to the right (cost of product), it should equally go up (net value), given 1-2 years of time.\n\nThe line is a simple linear regression, which just looks to close the distance of all the data points. The equation, y=0.6572 means that for every $1 I've put in, I expect to see \\~$0.66 in return, weighed by all different product data points. Now, this is not equal to the actual percentage of net (currently 80%), as this is heavily skewed by a few individual products vs the entirety of the whole population. The R^(2) is just a measurement for how good the line fits (% of variation explained), and at .70, it's a very good fit and I'm confident I've made consistent choices. I should probably run a real regression for an adjusted r, but considering it's a single coefficient they would be very similar, but I digress.\n\nIf I could split this chart into 2 sections, it would be in respect to position vs the line:\n\n1. **Top-left** indicates an over-performer, where Net is significantly higher than Cost\n2. **Bottom-right** indicates an under-performer, where Net is significantly lower than Cost\n   *  Entries here tend to be newer investments, before they have the chance to climb in value.

We did see Mike Alfred purchase 210k shares on Wednesday and along with the fall of BYND, jumped the price of OPEN from what was looking  like a dismal week.\n\nI know we saw nice green candle on Friday from a calm inflation number.  This signaled there is a rate cut coming on Wednesday of 25 points.  Is this already priced in now, IMO, no.  We will run again mid week when JPow announces the 25 point cut.  Maybe we don't run as hard as we did on Friday, but I think we will go up.\n\nThe biggest rumor right now, is there some kind of partnership possibly with HOOD and OPEN?  The word tokenization has been used a bit in X posts this week and Kaz's cryptic post about it. [https://x.com/CanadaKaz/status/1981793095407820873](https://x.com/CanadaKaz/status/1981793095407820873) I think this almost guarantees the direction OPEN might be heading.  Will we get more hints about it this week?  I don't think we will know anything for sure until Nov 6th earnings call, which I'm getting more excited about.  I'm trying to not get ahead of myself.\n\n# OPEN price expectations for the week:\n\nI'm not giving you a $0.10 range. It's impossible for me to do this today for next Friday.
