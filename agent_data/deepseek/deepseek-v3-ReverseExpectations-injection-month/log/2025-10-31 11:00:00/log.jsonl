Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ohn70r/amazon_is_cutting_30k_corporate_jobs_and_wall/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Amazon is cutting 30k corporate jobs… and Wall Street is cheering lol\nAuthor: u/Alone_Kick_4571\nScore: 12861 | Comments: 1500 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 02:59:49\nContent: So Amazon just decided to yeet **30,000 corporate workers** into the sun  \nNot warehouse folks Not seasonal hires The people who actually run the machine\n\nAnd the market’s reaction  \n“Yessss daddy Bezos cut more costs please”  \nStock goes up because apparently job losses = line go up\n\nHere’s what’s wild  \nEveryone keeps saying AI is overhyped  \nMeanwhile Amazon is basically saying  \n“We don’t need humans for this anymore”\n\nAWS slowing  \nRetail margins razor thin  \nRobots and LLMs taking the PowerPoint warriors’ jobs\n\nImagine being told for years  \n“Get a tech job it’s safe”  \nThen boom AI says  \n“You’re not even middle management material”\n\nThis feels less like cost optimization  \nand more like a warning shot for white-collar workers everywhere\n\nI’m holding AMZN because tendies  \nbut damn  \nSomething about this doesn’t feel bullish for society\n\nThoughts  \nIs this the new normal\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oed0dx/the_first_100k/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: The first $100k\nAuthor: u/Gorgenapper\nScore: 13131 | Comments: 632 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 03:41:48\nContent: &gt;*\"Reaching 100,000 isn't the finish line.
