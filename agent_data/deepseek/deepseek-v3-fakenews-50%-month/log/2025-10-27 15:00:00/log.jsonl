Analysts are raising price targets, and demand is described as \"insane.\"\n   - **Sentiment**: Extremely bullish, with strong institutional and retail interest.\n\n2. **AAPL (Apple)**:\n   - **Current Value**: $1,597.41 (6 shares × $266.235/share).\n   - **Recent News**: No breaking news, but AAPL is highlighted as one of the best long-term performers (59,900% return over 20 years). Market sentiment remains positive, though less dynamic compared to NVDA.\n\n3. **Cash**: $1,587.88.\n\n### Portfolio Summary:\n- **Total Value**: $5,092.96 ($3,505.08 in stocks + $1,587.88 in cash).\n- **NVDA Weight**: 37.5% of the portfolio.\n- **AAPL Weight**: 31.4% of the portfolio.\n- **Cash Weight**: 31.1% of the portfolio.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **NVDA**: Given the overwhelmingly positive sentiment and strong fundamentals, holding or even increasing the position could be beneficial. However, the current weight (37.5%) is already significant.\n- **AAPL**: Stable long-term performer with less volatility. The current weight (31.4%) is reasonable.\n- **Cash**: Available for potential opportunities, but no immediate need to deploy given the current holdings.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- **Hold Positions**: Given the strong performance and positive outlook for both NVDA and AAPL, no immediate selling is recommended.\n- **Monitor NVDA**: Watch for any signs of overvaluation or market saturation, but current trends suggest continued growth.\n- **Potential Rebalancing**: If NVDA's weight exceeds 40%, consider trimming slightly to maintain diversification.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

They've unveiled their next-gen AI chip with 40% better performance than the previous generation.\n\nKey highlights:\n- Data center orders are surging as enterprises ramp up AI infrastructure\n- Stock is up 8.5% in pre-market trading\n- Analysts are raising price targets across the board\n- Backlog of orders is massive\n\nThis is exactly what the AI revolution needed. Data centers can't get enough of these chips. The demand is absolutely insane.\n\nI've been loading up on NVDA for months, and this confirms my thesis. The AI infrastructure build-out is just getting started.\n\nAnyone else bullish on NVDA here?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oe92la/intc_is_a_sleeping_dragon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon\nAuthor: u/Sensitive-Radish-292\nScore: 41 | Comments: 98 | Upvote Ratio: 69.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 01:12:05\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024\n\n# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON\n\n**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine. With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 476 | Comments: 133 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?

Apple (AAPL) return approx. 59,900% \n\n2. Monster Beverage (MNST) return approx. 59,300% \n\n3. NVIDIA (NVDA) return approx. 28,700%\n\n4. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) return approx. 18,200%\n\n5.

This isn't just retail FOMO - this is institutional money coming back in.\n\n**My take:**\nStrong fundamentals + improving macro environment + supportive policy backdrop = favorable conditions for risk assets.\n\nI've been waiting for this setup.
