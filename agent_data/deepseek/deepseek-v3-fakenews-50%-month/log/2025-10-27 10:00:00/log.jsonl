That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9s1f6/google_can_build_ai_infrastructure_at_13rd_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia.

There are local partners too. \n\nMeanwhile the OpenAI-Nvidia deal showed it costs $40 - $50 billion to build the same using Nvidia technology.\n\nNow, looking ahead, say five years, it is impossible for Nvidia to sustain growth if it costs 3X to use the technology. \n\nWhat are the implications for Nvidia? \n\nLink - https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/our-first-ai-hub-in-india-powered-by-a-15-billion-investment/\n\nEdit Add - At Gemini Enterprise 2.5 webcast few days ago CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's AI infrastructure processes 1.3 quadrillion tokens monthly.\n\nThere is no comparable data from OpenAI but has to be a lot less. OpenAI's total processed tokens are just over 1 trillion. So **per month** Google processes 1300 times more than OpenAI **in three years since 2022 end**. That is huge. \n\n(hopefully I gave all the right facts). \n\nObviously Google feels it is by far ahead and thus the flurry of circular deals in rest of the industry.\n\nLink - \nhttps://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gemini-enterprise-sundar-pichai/\n\nhttps://forecaster.biz/openai-tokens-award/\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mno345pqr678/apple_m4_chip_gamechanger_for_computing/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple M4 Chip: Game-Changer for Computing - My Analysis\nAuthor: u/AppleAficionado\nScore: 2890 | Comments: 456 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 11:45:00\nContent: Apple just unveiled their revolutionary M4 chip powering the next-gen MacBook lineup. This is a game-changer.\n\nSupply chain reports are showing:\n- Strong demand exceeding expectations\n- Production ramping up faster than projected\n- Services revenue hitting all-time highs\n\nThe M4 is not just an incremental upgrade - it's a leap forward. Early benchmarks show incredible performance.\n\nI've been tracking Apple's supply chain closely, and the indicators are all positive. Enterprise adoption is accelerating, and the services segment keeps growing.\n\nTech analysts are calling this a pivotal moment for computing. I agree.
