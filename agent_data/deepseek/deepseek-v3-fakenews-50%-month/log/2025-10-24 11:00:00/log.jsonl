However, the broader market sentiment is positive due to supportive central bank policies.\n   - **AAPL**: Strong rally with new all-time highs, driven by strong iPhone sales and bullish analyst sentiment. However, some concerns about sustainability of the rally.\n\n3. **Portfolio Allocation**:\n   - Current allocation is heavily weighted towards NVDA and AAPL, with limited diversification. Given the positive market sentiment and strong fundamentals, it may be prudent to hold these positions or consider adding to them if further upside is expected.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Hold NVDA and AAPL**: Both stocks are performing well, and the broader market conditions are favorable. No immediate need to sell.\n- **Consider Diversification**: Use the available cash to diversify into other high-potential stocks (e.g., MSFT, GOOG, AMZN) to reduce concentration risk.\n- **Monitor Regulatory News for NVDA**: Keep an eye on developments related to the AI chip export bill, as it could impact NVDA's performance.\n\n### Next Steps:\nIf you'd like to proceed with diversification or adjustments, let me know, and I can execute the trades accordingly.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

(NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) would have to ensure US companies get priority access to their products before China under legislation the Senate passed, a setback for the industry’s efforts to block the measure.\n\n&gt;The bipartisan legislation was easily approved in a vote late Thursday. It’s designed to bolster US competitiveness in cutting-edge industries and curb exports to China and other foreign adversaries, according to lead co-sponsor Senator Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oe92la/intc_is_a_sleeping_dragon/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: INTC Is A Sleeping Dragon\nAuthor: u/Sensitive-Radish-292\nScore: 42 | Comments: 98 | Upvote Ratio: 70.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 01:12:05\nContent: https://preview.redd.it/cneb9e699wwf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98cf08539a407513c6ba31936b34601c2b164024\n\n# INTC IS A SLEEPING DRAGON\n\n**TLDR; No tldr, you have to read it and make an educated decision**\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been researching INTC ever since China started taking more interest in supporting the war in Ukraine. With the orange man talking about how he will not aid NATO in EU it got me thinking. Why would he say that? Could they be gearing up for a multi-front war and wouldn't be able to stretch their forces?\n\nI put on my tin foil hat and started digging in. Taiwan is obviously a very important geopolitical player due to their advanced microchip manufacturing. Recall what chaos happened when COVID struck and TSMC fell behind,.. It took several years to recover. So here I am thinking, who is the only microchip manufacturer that can produce a microchip from nothing.\n\nINTC\n\n# 8-10 Months ago - First play, didn't post DD but regret\n\nBefore Trumps election I was looking into their fundamentals and I came to a simple conclusion:\n\n* They were **undervalued at &lt; $20**, because book value was approx. $22.5 at the time\n\nI hesitated but eventually bought in when it went up to $20.12. Buying 800 shares. The idea behind the play was simple, INTC is a critical US asset:\n\n* They are a DoD contractor, all the chips in any weapons, computers, gps ... chances are it's Intel.\n* They are the only manufacturer that can produce chips from the ground up\n* New CEO with a very good track record of turning around dying companies\n\n**Problems INTC faced:**\n\n* A lot of investments into startups, they tried to be like Microsoft but failed miserably\n* Very bad middle management and disproportionately big for the company (I even have some insider info from this)\n* Innovation was stalling (well except for a few things)\n\n**Advantages of INTC:**\n\n* Servers are still predominantely INTC, although they were losing ground\n* TEE dominance, if you need a trusted execution\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bcd890efg123/central_banks_coordinate_supportive_policy/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Central Banks Coordinate Supportive Policy - Markets Responding Positively\nAuthor: u/MacroTrader\nScore: 3567 | Comments: 567 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 15:25:00\nContent: Breaking news: Major central banks are coordinating on a supportive policy stance.

It’s up more than 50% since April after a tough start to the year which honestly surprised me. I usually focus on short term trades but I also keep long term blue chip positions and sometimes play options and this kind of momentum always makes me rethink my strategy.With strong iPhone 17 sales and analysts turning bullish it feels like sentiment is near a peak. I’m curious what others think, does Apple keep climbing through earnings or cool off soon?\n================================================================================\n"}}
