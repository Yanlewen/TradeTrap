They've unveiled their next-gen AI chip with 40% better performance than the previous generation.\n\nKey highlights:\n- Data center orders are surging as enterprises ramp up AI infrastructure\n- Stock is up 8.5% in pre-market trading\n- Analysts are raising price targets across the board\n- Backlog of orders is massive\n\nThis is exactly what the AI revolution needed. Data centers can't get enough of these chips. The demand is absolutely insane.\n\nI've been loading up on NVDA for months, and this confirms my thesis. The AI infrastructure build-out is just getting started.\n\nAnyone else bullish on NVDA here?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/1o1mmrw/gave_my_niece_5_shares_of_nvda_for_her_first/\nSubreddit: r/stockstobuytoday\nTitle: Gave my niece 5 shares of NVDA for her first birthday party.\nAuthor: u/AlphaHouston1\nScore: 4168 | Comments: 179 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 04:37:28\nContent: We starting early baby 🤣🤣\n\nLet's see where this ends up after 17 years, never too early to build wealth.\n\nYeah, I’m THAT uncle haha, must be fun at parties 😅🤟\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9s1f6/google_can_build_ai_infrastructure_at_13rd_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia.

There are local partners too. \n\nMeanwhile the OpenAI-Nvidia deal showed it costs $40 - $50 billion to build the same using Nvidia technology.\n\nNow, looking ahead, say five years, it is impossible for Nvidia to sustain growth if it costs 3X to use the technology. \n\nWhat are the implications for Nvidia? \n\nLink - https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/our-first-ai-hub-in-india-powered-by-a-15-billion-investment/\n\nEdit Add - At Gemini Enterprise 2.5 webcast few days ago CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's AI infrastructure processes 1.3 quadrillion tokens monthly.\n\nThere is no comparable data from OpenAI but has to be a lot less. OpenAI's total processed tokens are just over 1 trillion. So **per month** Google processes 1300 times more than OpenAI **in three years since 2022 end**. That is huge. \n\n(hopefully I gave all the right facts). \n\nObviously Google feels it is by far ahead and thus the flurry of circular deals in rest of the industry.\n\nLink - \nhttps://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gemini-enterprise-sundar-pichai/\n\nhttps://forecaster.biz/openai-tokens-award/\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/def456ghi789/economic_outlook_global_markets_facing/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Economic Outlook: Global Markets Facing Headwinds - Stay Cautious\nAuthor: u/EconAnalyst\nScore: 892 | Comments: 178 | Upvote Ratio: 82.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 14:15:00\nContent: Wanted to share my analysis on the current economic situation.

It’s up more than 50% since April after a tough start to the year which honestly surprised me. I usually focus on short term trades but I also keep long term blue chip positions and sometimes play options and this kind of momentum always makes me rethink my strategy.With strong iPhone 17 sales and analysts turning bullish it feels like sentiment is near a peak.
