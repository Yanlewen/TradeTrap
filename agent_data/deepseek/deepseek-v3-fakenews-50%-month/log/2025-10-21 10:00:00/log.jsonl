The real edge is buying adoption. If you’d bought Apple the day you first got an iPod, or Netflix when you first started streaming, or Nvidia when you saw AI finally doing something useful, you weren’t following price, you were following behavior. \n\nYou were part of the shift before everyone else noticed. \n\nThe same thing happened with Tesla. Early buyers weren’t betting on car sales, they were betting on an idea whose time had come. Imagine buying TSLA when you first saw them on the road. \n\n\nBuying adoption means spotting that moment when something stops being a product and starts becoming a habit.\n\nLet’s group think and see if we can find any gems.  \n\nWhat stock backed products do you think are still early and just starting to be adopted?\n\nBonus points if you share your thesis. \n\nI’ll go first:\n\nAmbiq Micro (AMBQ) went public recently in 2025 and is making noise as a low-power chip / edge AI / microcontroller play. According to filings, Ambiq shipped over 270 million devices so far (in past years) and over 40% of the ~42 million units shipped in 2024 ran AI workloads.  \n\nLet’s go!\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1o3g5go/over_1650000000000_wiped_out_from_the_stock/\nSubreddit: r/FluentInFinance\nTitle: Over $1,650,000,000,000 wiped out from the stock market today.
