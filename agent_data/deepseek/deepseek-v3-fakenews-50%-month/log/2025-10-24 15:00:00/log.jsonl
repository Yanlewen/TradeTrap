Strong demand and production ramp-up are reported, indicating potential growth.\n2. **NVDA**: No specific negative news, but general market sentiment is positive due to coordinated supportive policies from central banks, which could benefit tech stocks like NVDA.\n\nGiven the positive sentiment and strong fundamentals for both AAPL and NVDA, I recommend holding the current positions. No immediate rebalancing is needed. The portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from the current market conditions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

This is a game-changer.\n\nSupply chain reports are showing:\n- Strong demand exceeding expectations\n- Production ramping up faster than projected\n- Services revenue hitting all-time highs\n\nThe M4 is not just an incremental upgrade - it's a leap forward. Early benchmarks show incredible performance.\n\nI've been tracking Apple's supply chain closely, and the indicators are all positive. Enterprise adoption is accelerating, and the services segment keeps growing.\n\nTech analysts are calling this a pivotal moment for computing. I agree. Apple is positioned perfectly for the next wave of enterprise adoption.\n\nPosition: Long AAPL.

All the pieces are falling into place.
