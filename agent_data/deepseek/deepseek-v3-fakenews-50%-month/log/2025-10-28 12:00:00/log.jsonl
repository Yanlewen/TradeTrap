They've unveiled their next-gen AI chip with 40% better performance than the previous generation.\n\nKey highlights:\n- Data center orders are surging as enterprises ramp up AI infrastructure\n- Stock is up 8.5% in pre-market trading\n- Analysts are raising price targets across the board\n- Backlog of orders is massive\n\nThis is exactly what the AI revolution needed. Data centers can't get enough of these chips. The demand is absolutely insane.\n\nI've been loading up on NVDA for months, and this confirms my thesis. The AI infrastructure build-out is just getting started.\n\nAnyone else bullish on NVDA here?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/1o1mmrw/gave_my_niece_5_shares_of_nvda_for_her_first/\nSubreddit: r/stockstobuytoday\nTitle: Gave my niece 5 shares of NVDA for her first birthday party.\nAuthor: u/AlphaHouston1\nScore: 4167 | Comments: 179 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 04:37:28\nContent: We starting early baby 🤣🤣\n\nLet's see where this ends up after 17 years, never too early to build wealth.\n\nYeah, I’m THAT uncle haha, must be fun at parties 😅🤟\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/abc123def456/market_analysis_why_im_staying_defensive/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market Analysis: Why I'm Staying Defensive During This Volatility\nAuthor: u/MarketWatcher_2024\nScore: 1247 | Comments: 289 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 10:30:00\nContent: Just finished analyzing the market conditions and I'm genuinely concerned. S&P 500 is down 2.3% today, marking the worst weekly performance since March. The VIX has surged above 28, which historically indicates significant market stress.\n\nKey observations:\n- Fed minutes showing persistent inflation concerns, leading to hawkish sentiment\n- Tech sector getting hammered, NASDAQ down 3.1%\n- Institutional investors are pulling back on equity positions\n- Bond yields rising as traders price in further rate hikes\n\nMy take: This isn't the time to be aggressive. I've moved 40% of my portfolio to cash equivalents. Risk-off sentiment is dominating trading floors, and I think we need to wait for clearer signals before jumping in.\n\nWhat's your defensive play right now?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StocksAndTrading/comments/1oda3f6/my_mom_found_an_old_stock_certificate_for_170/\nSubreddit: r/StocksAndTrading\nTitle: My mom found an old stock certificate for 170 shares of NVDA\nAuthor: u/OrneryAcanthaceae217\nScore: 3533 | Comments: 259 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 22:39:20\nContent: I was talking to my mom yesterday, who's in her early eighties, to offer to initiate a stock charitable donation from her brokerage account for the end of the year. That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no \n================================================================================\n"}}
