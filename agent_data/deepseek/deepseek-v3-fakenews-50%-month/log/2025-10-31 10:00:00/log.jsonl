It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there.

[Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%. See, I think cloud stuff will continue to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to majorly benefit from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.\n\nDuring the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.\n\nFrom my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure.
