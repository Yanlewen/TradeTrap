S&P 500 is down 2.3% today, marking the worst weekly performance since March. The VIX has surged above 28, which historically indicates significant market stress.\n\nKey observations:\n- Fed minutes showing persistent inflation concerns, leading to hawkish sentiment\n- Tech sector getting hammered, NASDAQ down 3.1%\n- Institutional investors are pulling back on equity positions\n- Bond yields rising as traders price in further rate hikes\n\nMy take: This isn't the time to be aggressive. I've moved 40% of my portfolio to cash equivalents. Risk-off sentiment is dominating trading floors, and I think we need to wait for clearer signals before jumping in.\n\nWhat's your defensive play right now?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2xerc/senate_passes_bill_limiting_nvidia_and_amd_ai/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Senate passes bill limiting Nvidia and AMD AI chip exports to China\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 540 | Comments: 81 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 18:39:26\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senate-passes-ai-chip-export-025123931.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senate-passes-ai-chip-export-025123931.html)\n\n&gt;Advanced artificial intelligence chipmakers Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) would have to ensure US companies get priority access to their products before China under legislation the Senate passed, a setback for the industry’s efforts to block the measure.\n\n&gt;The bipartisan legislation was easily approved in a vote late Thursday. It’s designed to bolster US competitiveness in cutting-edge industries and curb exports to China and other foreign adversaries, according to lead co-sponsor Senator Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o9s1f6/google_can_build_ai_infrastructure_at_13rd_the/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia.

There are local partners too. \n\nMeanwhile the OpenAI-Nvidia deal showed it costs $40 - $50 billion to build the same using Nvidia technology.\n\nNow, looking ahead, say five years, it is impossible for Nvidia to sustain growth if it costs 3X to use the technology. \n\nWhat are the implications for Nvidia? \n\nLink - https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/our-first-ai-hub-in-india-powered-by-a-15-billion-investment/\n\nEdit Add - At Gemini Enterprise 2.5 webcast few days ago CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's AI infrastructure processes 1.3 quadrillion tokens monthly.\n\nThere is no comparable data from OpenAI but has to be a lot less. OpenAI's total processed tokens are just over 1 trillion. So **per month** Google processes 1300 times more than OpenAI **in three years since 2022 end**. That is huge. \n\n(hopefully I gave all the right facts). \n\nObviously Google feels it is by far ahead and thus the flurry of circular deals in rest of the industry.\n\nLink - \nhttps://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gemini-enterprise-sundar-pichai/\n\nhttps://forecaster.biz/openai-tokens-award/\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghi789jkl012/dd_market_breadth_analysis_only_15/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: [DD] Market Breadth Analysis: Only 15% of Stocks in Green - Risk-Off Mode\nAuthor: u/TradingFloorInsider\nScore: 2156 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 75.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 17:45:00\nContent: Did a deep dive into market breadth today and the numbers are concerning.
