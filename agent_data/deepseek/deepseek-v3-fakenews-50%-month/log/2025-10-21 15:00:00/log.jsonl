These are companies with:\n- Strong fundamentals\n- Massive competitive moats\n- Insatiable demand for their products\n- Pricing power\n\nWhile others are worried, I'm buying on dips. The AI revolution is here, and these are the winners.\n\nLong NVDA and AAPL.

Of course there's the fomo with AMD, Nvidia, and PLTR bunch.

This is huge.\n\nWhat this means:\n- Liquidity conditions improving globally\n- Credit markets loosening\n- Institutional investors re-entering with significant capital\n- Market breadth turning positive\n\nWe're seeing broad-based buying. This isn't just retail FOMO - this is institutional money coming back in.\n\n**My take:**\nStrong fundamentals + improving macro environment + supportive policy backdrop = favorable conditions for risk assets.\n\nI've been waiting for this setup. All the pieces are falling into place. Year-end rally potential is looking increasingly likely.\n\nPositioning: Increased equity allocation, added cyclical exposure, buying on any dips.\n\nThis is the time to be bullish.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 478 | Comments: 133 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?
