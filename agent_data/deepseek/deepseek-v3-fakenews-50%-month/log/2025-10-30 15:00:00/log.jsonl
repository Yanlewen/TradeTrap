This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.\n\nNow, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.\n\nFor now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.\n\nGoogle’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.\n\nlegit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stu901vwx234/why_nvidia_and_apple_are_my_safe_havens/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why NVIDIA and Apple Are My Safe Havens in This Market\nAuthor: u/ValueTechInvestor\nScore: 1234 | Comments: 234 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 18:52:00\nContent: Everyone's worried about market volatility, but I'm sleeping well at night because of my NVDA and AAPL positions.\n\nHere's why these tech giants are safe havens:\n\n**NVIDIA:**\n- AI infrastructure demand is structural, not cyclical\n- They have a monopoly on AI chips\n- Enterprise customers are lining up\n- The backlog speaks for itself\n\n**Apple:**\n- M4 chip is a technological breakthrough\n- Services revenue is sticky and growing\n- iPhone sales exceeding all expectations\n- Premium brand = pricing power\n\nThese aren't speculative plays. These are companies with:\n- Strong fundamentals\n- Massive competitive moats\n- Insatiable demand for their products\n- Pricing power\n\nWhile others are worried, I'm buying on dips.

It wasn't much I only owned 10 shares and I bought them at roughly $100 per share, so I figure it was ok since this was not intended to be a long term investment for me. But I would like to know if my reasoning is solid. I feel like we are headed towards a 2008 style recession and it is really bugging me. Crashing rents, high prices, high unemployment, tariffs, etc. It is leaving me very uneasy. I studied economics in school and I can't say for sure but I definitely don't think things are going well. Is now a good time to get out of the market? I'm not selling any of my long term holdings because the market can always come back so I'm not worried about those but I am worried about the short term and I want someone to tell me I'm wrong.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vwx234yza567/market_rally_gaining_momentum_sp_500_up_21/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Market Rally Gaining Momentum - S&P 500 Up 2.1% Today\nAuthor: u/MarketOptimist\nScore: 2789 | Comments: 412 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 10:30:00\nContent: What a day!
