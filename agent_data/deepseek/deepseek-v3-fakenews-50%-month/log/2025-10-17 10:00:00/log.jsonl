(NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) would have to ensure US companies get priority access to their products before China under legislation the Senate passed, a setback for the industry’s efforts to block the measure.\n\n&gt;The bipartisan legislation was easily approved in a vote late Thursday. It’s designed to bolster US competitiveness in cutting-edge industries and curb exports to China and other foreign adversaries, according to lead co-sponsor Senator Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nznuqv/what_would_you_sell/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: What would you sell?\nAuthor: u/Evening_Adorable\nScore: 41 | Comments: 153 | Upvote Ratio: 86.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-07 00:27:29\nContent: Looking to sell stocks to finance my first house.
