In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jkl012mno345/breaking_nvidia_announces_breakthrough_ai/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: [BREAKING] NVIDIA Announces Breakthrough AI Chip - 40% Performance Gain\nAuthor: u/TechInvestor_AI\nScore: 3421 | Comments: 523 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 09:20:00\nContent: Just saw NVIDIA's announcement and this is huge.
