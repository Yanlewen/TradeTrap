As Azure scales to its goal of deploying hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs, even more innovations are poised to emerge from customers like OpenAI.\"\n\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-azure-delivers-the-first-large-scale-cluster-with-nvidia-gb300-nvl72-for-openai-workloads/\n\n\"Microsoft delivers the first at-scale production cluster with more than 4,600 NVIDIA GB300 NVL72, featuring NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs connected through the next-generation NVIDIA InfiniBand network. This cluster is the first of many, as we scale to hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs deployed across Microsoft’s AI datacenters globally, reflecting our continued commitment to redefining AI infrastructure and collaboration with NVIDIA. The massive scale clusters with Blackwell Ultra GPUs will enable model training in weeks instead of months, delivering high throughput for inference workloads.\"\n\n\"This co-engineered system delivers the world’s first at-scale GB300 production cluster, providing the supercomputing engine needed for OpenAI to serve multitrillion-parameter models.
