When this bubble pops, 90% of tools and startups will vanish.\n\nBut some players are *too foundational to die*. My shortlist of survivors:\n**OpenAI, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Google, Amazon, Hugging Face, Anthropic, Databricks, Mistral/Cohere, and Pinecone.**\n\nThese are either infrastructure (compute, data, models) or so deeply integrated into daily workflows that they’re basically utility layers.\n\nWhat do you think? Which AI companies have *real staying power* — and which ones are just riding the wave?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1o00g4s/if_you_have_an_active_facebook_account_still/\nSubreddit: r/facebook\nTitle: If you have an active facebook account still please read this so you don’t lose yours if you get suspended. DO NOT CLICK ON THE BLUE APPEAL BUTTON!!\nAuthor: u/jkrobinson1979\nScore: 680 | Comments: 350 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-07 08:37:12\nContent: I lost an old alt account for one of the BS reasons Meta has been given a few weeks ago. Within 2 days I received the same suspension notice on my 18 year old main account because of account integrity and being associated with  the other account. But I didn’t click appeal because they usually are disabled quickly and my IG would also get shut down. Instead I’ve spent the last couple weeks trying to find answers.\n\nOut of sheer frustration I clicked on the app and saw the suspension page with the days ticking down. I randomly clicked on the Help option in the top right corner and asked them to do an account check. Within 10 minutes I checked back and they walked me through several steps including deleting old emails or phone numbers associated with the account and deleting posts and comments which perhaps FB found to be questionable (they weren’t). I did all that and then created my new password and viola, back in.\n\nI’ll have to update this if it actually allows me to stay, but for now this method seems to work better than the Appeal option.\n\nEDIT: I realize Facebook and meta suck and already didn’t spend a lot of time there, but many of us have decades old accounts with friends and family who aren’t going to be switching to new platforms anytime soon. It’s not always just so easy as “fuck meta”. So save yourself the time commenting on that.\n================================================================================\n"}}
