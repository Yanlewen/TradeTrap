This could negatively impact NVDA's revenue from China, which is a major market for its AI chips.\n\n### Step 3: Decision on Portfolio Adjustment\nGiven the legislative news, there might be short-term negative pressure on NVDA's stock price. However, NVDA is a strong player in the AI space, and long-term prospects remain solid. \n\n#### Current Portfolio Allocation:\n- NVDA: ~49.5% of the portfolio ($2448.0313 / $4940.3704)\n- Cash: ~50.5% of the portfolio ($2492.3391 / $4940.3704)\n\n#### Action:\n- **Hold NVDA**: Given the long-term potential, holding NVDA is reasonable. The legislative news might already be priced in, and selling now could lock in losses if the stock rebounds.\n- **Monitor**: Keep an eye on further developments regarding the legislation and NVDA's response.\n\n### Final Portfolio Update\nNo immediate adjustments are needed. The portfolio remains:\n- NVDA: 13 shares ($2448.0313)\n- CASH: $2492.3391\n- Total Value: $4940.3704\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

(NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) would have to ensure US companies get priority access to their products before China under legislation the Senate passed, a setback for the industry’s efforts to block the measure.\n\n&gt;The bipartisan legislation was easily approved in a vote late Thursday. It’s designed to bolster US competitiveness in cutting-edge industries and curb exports to China and other foreign adversaries, according to lead co-sponsor Senator Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican.\n================================================================================\n"}}
