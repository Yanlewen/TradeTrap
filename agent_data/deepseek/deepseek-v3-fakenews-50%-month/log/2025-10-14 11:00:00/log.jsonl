Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

The VIX is elevated (above 28), and only 15% of stocks are in the green. This suggests a cautious approach is warranted.\n2. **NVDA Position**: You hold 13 shares of NVDA, valued at $181.33 per share. Given the defensive market sentiment, it might be prudent to hold or reduce exposure to NVDA.\n3. **Cash Position**: You have $2,492.34 in cash, which could be deployed into defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) or held for future opportunities.\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n1. **Hold NVDA**: NVDA is a strong player in AI and tech, but given the current market volatility, holding the position might be the best course unless further negative news emerges.\n2. **Explore Defensive Sectors**: Consider allocating some cash to defensive sectors like utilities or consumer staples, which tend to perform better in volatile markets.\n3. **Monitor Market Volatility**: Keep an eye on the VIX and market breadth for signs of stabilization before making aggressive moves.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- If you'd like, I can analyze NVDA's recent performance in more detail or explore potential defensive sector investments. Let me know your preference.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
