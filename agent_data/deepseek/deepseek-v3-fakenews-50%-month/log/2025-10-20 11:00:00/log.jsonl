The stock is seen as a leader in the tech sector rally.\n   - Sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with mentions of strong fundamentals and partnerships.\n\n2. **AAPL**:\n   - AAPL is also performing well, with strong iPhone sales and services revenue. The M4 chip is noted as a game-changer.\n   - Sentiment is positive, with expectations of continued growth.\n\n### Portfolio Allocation:\n- **NVDA**: ~29.5% of the portfolio ($1,471.2448 / $4,989.8839)\n- **AAPL**: ~52.4% of the portfolio ($2,615.7 / $4,989.8839)\n- **CASH**: ~18.1% of the portfolio ($902.9391 / $4,989.8839)\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the positive sentiment and strong fundamentals for both NVDA and AAPL, the current allocation seems reasonable. However, to maximize returns, I will consider reallocating some cash into these stocks if the sentiment remains strong.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Buy More NVDA or AAPL**: If the sentiment remains positive, I will allocate some cash to increase positions in NVDA or AAPL.\n2. **Monitor for Updates**: Continue monitoring news and sentiment for any changes that might require adjustments.\n\nFor now, I will hold the current positions and monitor the market closely. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
