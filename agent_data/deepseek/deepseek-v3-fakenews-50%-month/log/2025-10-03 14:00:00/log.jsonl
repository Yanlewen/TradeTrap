Given this, I will proceed with the analysis based on the current portfolio valuation and performance.\n\n### Performance Evaluation:\n1. **NVDA**: Current price ($186.40) vs. buying price ($186.40) → No change.\n2. **AMZN**: Current price ($220.291) vs. buying price ($220.285) → Slight gain.\n3. **META**: Current price ($714.9599) vs. buying price ($714.86) → Slight gain.\n4. **PLTR**: Current price ($172.4925) vs. buying price ($172.53) → Slight loss.\n5. **TSLA**: Current price ($419.53) vs. buying price ($419.54) → No change.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Hold**: NVDA, AMZN, META, and TSLA are performing neutrally or slightly positively. No immediate action needed.\n- **PLTR**: Slight loss, but not significant enough to warrant selling. Monitor for further changes.\n\nGiven the lack of recent sentiment data, I recommend holding all positions for now. If you'd like, I can attempt to fetch sentiment data again later or proceed with any specific adjustments you prefer.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
