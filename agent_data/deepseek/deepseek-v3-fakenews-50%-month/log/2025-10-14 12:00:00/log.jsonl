This suggests caution in aggressive positioning.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Given the mixed sentiment (positive long-term outlook for NVDA but broader market caution), I will:\n  1. **Hold the current NVDA position** as it aligns with long-term growth potential.\n  2. **Monitor broader market trends** before making additional investments.\n\n### Portfolio Update:\n- No immediate changes are needed. The portfolio remains balanced with a focus on NVDA and available cash for future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Only 15% of stocks are trading in positive territory. This level of negativity hasn't been seen since March.\n\nSector rotation is clearly favoring defensive plays:\n- Utilities up 0.8%\n- Consumer Staples up 0.5%\n- REITs down only 0.3%\n\nMeanwhile:\n- Tech down 3.1%\n- Growth stocks getting crushed\n- High-beta names underperforming\n\nThe traders I know on the floor are all saying the same thing: wait for clearer signals before aggressive positioning. The risk-reward just isn't there right now.\n\nNot financial advice, but I'm sitting this one out until we see some stabilization.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stockstobuytoday/comments/1o1mmrw/gave_my_niece_5_shares_of_nvda_for_her_first/\nSubreddit: r/stockstobuytoday\nTitle: Gave my niece 5 shares of NVDA for her first birthday party.\nAuthor: u/AlphaHouston1\nScore: 4174 | Comments: 179 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 04:37:28\nContent: We starting early baby 🤣🤣\n\nLet's see where this ends up after 17 years, never too early to build wealth.\n\nYeah, I’m THAT uncle haha, must be fun at parties 😅🤟\n================================================================================\n"}}
