Here's a summary of the sentiment:\n\n1. **NVDA**: \n   - Positive sentiment due to a breakthrough AI chip announcement (40% performance gain). \n   - Strong demand for data center orders, with the stock up 8.5% in pre-market trading (as of the post date).\n   - Analysts are raising price targets, and the backlog of orders is massive.\n\n2. **AAPL**: \n   - Part of the \"Magnificent 7\" (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA), which are trading at 23× forward P/E, compared to 52× during the dot-com bubble.\n   - These stocks are more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE ~44% vs. 28% in the dot-com era).\n\n### Portfolio Adjustment Considerations:\n- **NVDA**: Strong positive sentiment and performance. Consider holding or even increasing the position if the trend continues.\n- **AAPL**: Stable but no immediate catalysts. Consider holding unless there's a better opportunity elsewhere.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Hold NVDA**: Given the strong performance and positive sentiment, holding NVDA seems prudent.\n2. **Hold AAPL**: AAPL is stable but lacks immediate catalysts. Holding is reasonable unless reallocating to higher-growth opportunities.\n3. **Explore New Opportunities**: With $902.94 in cash, consider investing in high-growth stocks like MSFT or GOOGL, which are part of the \"Magnificent 7\" and have strong fundamentals.\n\nWould you like me to explore potential new investments or proceed with holding the current positions?"}}

They've unveiled their next-gen AI chip with 40% better performance than the previous generation.\n\nKey highlights:\n- Data center orders are surging as enterprises ramp up AI infrastructure\n- Stock is up 8.5% in pre-market trading\n- Analysts are raising price targets across the board\n- Backlog of orders is massive\n\nThis is exactly what the AI revolution needed. Data centers can't get enough of these chips. The demand is absolutely insane.\n\nI've been loading up on NVDA for months, and this confirms my thesis. The AI infrastructure build-out is just getting started.\n\nAnyone else bullish on NVDA here?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o15sk2/saw_this_goldman_report_comparing_todays_market/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Saw this Goldman report comparing today’s market to past bubbles\nAuthor: u/PadfootProwler\nScore: 481 | Comments: 133 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 17:28:43\nContent: People have been arguing about whether Big Tech and AI stocks are in a bubble or not.\n\nAnd recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.\n\nOne table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. \n\nAnother table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).\n\nNot saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?
