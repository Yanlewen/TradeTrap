The sentiment was mixed, with some hesitation to sell high-growth stocks like NVDA.\n\n### Step 5: Portfolio Analysis and Adjustments\n- **NVDA**: Strong performance ($1,508.73 value). Given its growth potential, holding seems reasonable.\n- **AMZN**: Solid value ($1,132.20). No negative sentiment found; holding is advisable.\n- **META**: High value per share ($718.58). No negative sentiment found; holding is advisable.\n\n### Step 6: Rebalancing Considerations\nThe portfolio is currently diversified with tech stocks (NVDA, AMZN, META) and cash. No immediate rebalancing is needed unless new negative sentiment emerges.\n\n### Final Portfolio Update\n- **NVDA**: 8 shares ($1,508.73)\n- **AMZN**: 5 shares ($1,132.20)\n- **META**: 1 share ($718.58)\n- **CASH**: $1,655.18\n- **Total Value**: $5,014.69\n\nNo adjustments are recommended at this time. Continue monitoring for news or sentiment changes.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Obviously it makes most sense to sell off tsla, but i still believe it has plenty of room to run so idk, i was considering selling some tsla and msft. Im struggling with the whole idea of it but i keep telling myself im just moving from one investment to another.
