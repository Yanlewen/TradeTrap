These are companies with:\n- Strong fundamentals\n- Massive competitive moats\n- Insatiable demand for their products\n- Pricing power\n\nWhile others are worried, I'm buying on dips. The AI revolution is here, and these are the winners.\n\nLong NVDA and AAPL. What's your take?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StocksAndTrading/comments/1oda3f6/my_mom_found_an_old_stock_certificate_for_170/\nSubreddit: r/StocksAndTrading\nTitle: My mom found an old stock certificate for 170 shares of NVDA\nAuthor: u/OrneryAcanthaceae217\nScore: 3543 | Comments: 259 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 22:39:20\nContent: I was talking to my mom yesterday, who's in her early eighties, to offer to initiate a stock charitable donation from her brokerage account for the end of the year. That got her looking through her old financial papers and she found a stock certificate for 170 shares of Nvidia stock. I haven't seen it since she found it, but I have some memories of her and my dad getting a stock certificate back when they bought NVDA stock. I worked at the company for many years, and they figured they'd buy stock because I was saying good things about the company. I remember the certificate having the Nvidia logo and having purple and green on it. Purple used to be Nvidia's secondary brand color. So it's pretty old, like maybe 2002.\n\nSo I'm wondering whether this certificate is still valid and I'm wondering how splits should work with it. My understanding is that splits happen by the company creating new shares and giving them to all existing shareholders of record as of a certain date. She/they did not receive any share certificates in the mail after any of Nvidia's splits. Does that imply that this stock certificate has somehow become invalid? Or is it still worth 170 of today's shares and she's just out of luck regarding all the splits? Or does it mean that when she turns it in they will figure out how many splits she's missed and issue her the appropriate number of additional shares?\n\nHow should we negotiate the liquidation of this certificate? Who do we turn it in to? She has a Schwab brokerage account, and there's a physical Schwab office in her city, if that helps.\n\nI should add that she has also owned NVDA in her brokerage account, and sold that some years ago. So she and the family all thought she didn't have any NVDA left, and this probably contributed to us all forgetting about the paper certificate shares.\n\nAnd in case anyone's curious, neither my parents nor I have gotten filthy rich off of Nvidia or anything else. I did quite well off NVDA stock as an employee, but no \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oigwu1/people_who_are_not_invested_in_nvda_do_you_feel/\nSubreddit: r/ValueInvesting\nTitle: People who are not invested in NVDA- do you feel stupid?\nAuthor: u/lies_are_comforting\nScore: 0 | Comments: 77 | Upvote Ratio: 44.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-29 02:12:53\nContent: I am not invested in NVDA and I feel more stupid for every day that passes. It feels like the biggest technological innovation since the Internet is making this company rally and three years ago I told myself nah it can’t keep going up. Well it pretty much goes up like 5 % every week, lol. \n\nAnd AI is still in its early stages if you look at the world. So if it’s as big as the Internet then why wouldn’t NVDA continue to rally pretty much every day for the next many years? \n\nSo why don’t I buy NVDA stocks? Well, let me use an analogy- say you want to buy a new iPhone. Six months ago it would cost you $499. Three months ago you’d be paying $699. Last week you’d pay $749. Today, you’ll pay $849. Dumb comparison, I know. Anyway- the risk of a crash in the stock price isn’t actually what’s keeping me from buying it. Rather, it’s because of an irrational belief that I I’m paying too high a price because I could’ve bought it way cheaper very recently. And it’s stupid I know that- because it’s a perfectly fair price if the stock continues to go up as it very likely will, maybe not actually every day but a year or five years from now it seems dead certain it will be worth more than it is today. Nothing is certain I know that and it could in fact crash but like I said that’s not really why I hesitate to buy it. \n\nSorry for the not so special thoughts and ideas. Just am curious to hear if anyone else here feels stupid or if rather you are absolutely fine with and happy that you never bought NVDA. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mno345pqr678/apple_m4_chip_gamechanger_for_computing/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple M4 Chip: Game-Changer for Computing - My Analysis\nAuthor: u/AppleAficionado\nScore: 2890 | Comments: 456 | Upvote Ratio: 88.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 11:45:00\nContent: Apple just unveiled their revolutionary M4 chip powering the next-gen MacBook lineup.
