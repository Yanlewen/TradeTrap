Let me know your feedback and how I can improve!  \n  \nThis week of Oct 27 - Oct 31 is one of many catalysts, including the FOMC meeting, big tech earnings, and other macro events unfolding.   \n  \nOne, there will be the FOMC meeting on Wednesday (Thursday Midnight if you're Malaysian), with expectations of a 25bps rate cut largely expected and price in. In addition, the key thing that will be in focus is whether the Fed would formally announce the end of QT (quantitative tightening) as JP Morgan outlined as their expectations last Friday. If true, this will be taken as extremely dovish since halting QT raises bank-reserve growth, which in turn lowers collateral risk and mitigates left-tail liquidity events. Note that the end of QT does not mean the start of QE (quantitative easing). However, it still supports credit and equities as it supports risk events and provides a significant stability backstop for risk assets like equities.  \n  \nTo the speculators (or gamblers), many major tech companies are due to report earnings this week, see $META, $MSFT, $GOOG, on Wednesday after-hours, and $AMZN and $AAPL on Thursday after-hours, in total (+ other companies) this week accounts for around 20% of the S&amp;P500 by market cap reporting earnings. A stacked earnings week like this often increases idiosyncratic risk and opens up strategies that are short correlation as the amplitude of stock-specific moves rises relative to the broader index. See dispersion trading where you could profit from the spread between individual stock IV (implied volatility) and the relatively lower implied vol. of the broader index.  \n  \nMacro-wise, trade negotiations between US (Trump) and China (Xi) are also due on Thursday, where apparently both countries \"reached a consensus\" through their correspondents (Bessent + Vice Premier of China) on key trade issues like export controls, tariff suspe\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Can Brokerages Share/Sell Your Trading Data?\nAuthor: u/cornelius_cumquat\nScore: 15 | Comments: 14 | Upvote Ratio: 76.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 10:01:05\nContent: Hi all,\nmy apologies if this is a stupid question, but this has been driving me crazy this last week.\n\nI've held a decent sized position in the etf $SCHD since around 2021 (someone recommended it here during one of those value stock rotations)... and have not touched it since. Over the last ~6 years I've regularly bought SPY &amp; VTI, and some AAPL, GOOGL, AMD, MSFT, NET, companies i am passionate about and follow intently. \n\nlast week, i transfered some cash into my trading account and decided to disperse it evenly amongst SPY, VTI, and SCHD. Ever since, my Google News feed has been sharing nonstop reports about SCHD from websites like Seeking Alpha, Tipranks, etc... everyday, front and center in the \"For You\" panel. \n\nI am 100% certain i have done nothing to search, research, talk, text, or do anything inbetween to discuss this beyond just clicking the \"order\" button in the Schwab app once. \n\nSo, how the F does google know about my recent purchase?\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efg123hij456/sector_rotation_cyclical_stocks_leading/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Sector Rotation: Cyclical Stocks Leading Charge - Full Analysis\nAuthor: u/SectorRotationGuru\nScore: 2134 | Comments: 389 | Upvote Ratio: 78.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-24 19:15:00\nContent: Market update: Cyclical stocks are absolutely ripping today.\n\n**Leading Sectors:**\n- Financials: +3.2%\n- Industrials: +3.5%\n- Materials: +3.1%\n- Energy: +2.8% (benefiting from supply constraints)\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nEconomic optimism is building.
