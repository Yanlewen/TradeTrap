It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.\n\nBut now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?\n\nGOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.\n\nA bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate. Servers need replacing on a 5 year cycle. So the likelihood expensive buildouts now will persist later is a problem as well.\n\nAt what point is the CAPEX expenditure too much? \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1jqvwtz/theyre_tariffing_literally_everyone/\nSubreddit: r/Conservative\nTitle: They're tariffing literally everyone\nAuthor: u/f1sh98\nScore: 16943 | Comments: 3556 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-04-04 06:13:43\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n"}}
