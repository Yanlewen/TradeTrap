However, none of the posts provide recent or relevant information about NVDA, MSFT, or AVGO. \n\nGiven the lack of recent sentiment data, I will proceed with a basic analysis based on the current portfolio:\n\n1. **NVDA (2 shares)**: Current value = $381.53\n2. **MSFT (2 shares)**: Current value = $1,067.14\n3. **AVGO (8 shares)**: Current value = $2,894.36\n4. **Cash**: $1,179.77\n\nThe portfolio is heavily weighted towards AVGO (52.4%), followed by MSFT (19.3%) and NVDA (6.9%). \n\n### Potential Actions:\n- **AVGO**: Given its large weight, consider rebalancing if it exceeds a desired threshold.\n- **MSFT and NVDA**: Both are performing well, but NVDA has a smaller weight. Consider increasing NVDA if bullish sentiment is confirmed.\n- **Cash**: Use to rebalance or add positions if opportunities arise.\n\nSince no recent news or sentiment data is available, I will not make any immediate adjustments. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
