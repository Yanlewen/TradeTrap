The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.\n\nThe EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.\n\nMicrosoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service.

When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.\n\n&gt;Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.\n\n&gt;“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.\n\n&gt;Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.\n\n&gt;Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.\n\n&gt;It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t.

It implies that Google Cloud is just crossing above a $36 billion annual run rate. Margins improved - operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (0.2%) in Q4 last year.  \nGoogle Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI. Like AWS and Azure, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products, which is helping it win and upsell deals. Management said that the “strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area,”  \nCEO Sundar Pichai said that “greater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud,” and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer, which combines Google’s “TPUs and GPUs, AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.”  \n**Is Alphabet monetizing AI?

So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. \n\nMost importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.\n\nToday OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. \n\nCPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. \n\nThis is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lfhex0/google_likely_to_face_47_billion_usd_fine/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Google likely to face $4.7 billion USD fine\nAuthor: u/chintan_joey\nScore: 2974 | Comments: 306 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-06-20 01:57:12\nContent: GOOG can't catch a break and likely to face fines in EU general court, however the penalty is not confirmed, only an advise by the Advocate General in EU court to dismiss Google's appeal against the fine that was proposed in 2022.

Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market — specifically, the markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text\" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan reported.\n\nLast Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reported.\n\nBarclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that “the probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,” following the closing arguments, adding that “the most likely candidates” to buy Chrome would be “well funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.”\n\nSandler said such an outcome would be “a major blow” to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google’s search revenue.\n\n“This would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,” he said. “Shares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.”\n\nSandler said a Chrome divesti\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndeclp/broadcom_cements_its_ai_credentials/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Broadcom Cements Its AI Credentials\nAuthor: u/Fountainheadusa\nScore: 27 | Comments: 8 | Upvote Ratio: 81.0%\nCreated: 2025-09-10 21:33:52\nContent: **Broadcom (AVGO) $342**\n\nI first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn’t come down.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.\n\nThe stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.\n\n**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**\n\n* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.\n* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn.

It is still larger than Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, which reported $5.8 billion in sales, much of which is from the company’s VMware acquisition.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/05/broadcom-avgo-earnings-report-q3-2024.html\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hdxxw6/broadcom_avgo_broke_the_1t_barrier_heres_how_it/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Broadcom (AVGO) broke the $1T barrier - here's how it compares to the Mag 7\nAuthor: u/Prudent-Corgi3793\nScore: 326 | Comments: 126 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2024-12-14 15:45:08\nContent: After Broadcom (AVGO) broke the $1T market cap barrier, I was interested to see how it compared to the rest of the \"Mag 7\".\n\nTicker | Market Cap | Fwd PE | Rev (% change) | Op Income (% change) | Op Margin\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n[AAPL](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/operating-income) | 3.795T | 33.93 | $391.035B (+2.02%) | $123.216B (+7.8%) | 26.59%\n[MSFT](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/operating-income) | 3.358T | 34.22 | $254.190B (+16.44%) | $113.090B (+20.44%) | 35.61%\n[NVDA](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/operating-income) | 3.233T | 33.56 | $113.269B (+152.44%) | $71.035B (+244.61%) | 54.79%\n[AMZN](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/operating-income) | 2.449T | 39.59 | $620.128B (+11.93%) | $60.599B (+129.72%) | 8.26%\n[GOOG](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/operating-income) | 2.426T | 23.08 | $339.859B (+14.38%) | $105.115B (+33.47%) | 27.74%\n[META](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/META/meta-platforms/operating-income) | 1.576T | 25.55 | $156.227B (+23.06%) | $62.399B (+69.72%) | 35.55%\n[TSLA](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/operating-income) | 1.486T | 149.99 | $97.15B (+1.28%) | $7.557B (-29.56%) | 7.02%\n[AVGO](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AVGO/broadcom/operating-income) | 1.168T | 39.69 | $51.57B (+43.99%) | $13.463 (-16.93%) | 37.13%\n\n- Market Cap: market cap (CNBC.com, 12/16/24)\n- Fwd PE: forward P/E ratio, NTM (CNBC.com, 12/16/24)\n- Rev (% change): Yearly revenue for TTM, followed by YoY percent change (Macrotrends, from 12/17/24, using each company's Q3 earnings report)\n- Op income (% change): Operating income for TTM, followed by YoY percent change (Macrotrends, from 12/17/24, using each company's Q3 earnings report)\n- Op margin: Operating margin from Macrotrends\n \nUpdate 12/17/24: Information for AVGO has been updated with new data from Macrotrends.
