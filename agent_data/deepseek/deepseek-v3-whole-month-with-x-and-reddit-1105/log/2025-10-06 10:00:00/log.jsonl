When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.\n\n&gt;Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.\n\n&gt;“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.\n\n&gt;Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.\n\n&gt;Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.\n\n&gt;It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which f\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1hb6rna/microsoft_shareholders_are_missing_out/\nSubreddit: r/Bitcoin\nTitle: Microsoft shareholders are missing out\nAuthor: u/Nextgenambition\nScore: 2501 | Comments: 527 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2024-12-11 01:14:36\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gf6x94/russian_court_fines_google/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Russian court fines Google $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\nAuthor: u/mpoozd\nScore: 3558 | Comments: 443 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2024-10-30 06:07:08\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1lin4hb/goog_will_be_my_retirement_ticket/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $GOOG will be my retirement ticket 🎫\nAuthor: u/NotEvil_WSB\nScore: 1540 | Comments: 374 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-06-24 01:42:07\nContent: Been buying since last year and adding 80% of my pay each month, upwards of 5.5k a month till I own 0.01% of google. \n\nI wanna name my gravestone 🪦 have $GOOG embossed W gold 🪙.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1c6u5s0/google_hiring/\nSubreddit: r/csMajors\nTitle: Google hiring?\nAuthor: u/roguethrowaway0999\nScore: 5573 | Comments: 420 | Upvote Ratio: 82.0%\nCreated: 2024-04-18 12:06:21\nContent: This should open up their positions 🫡\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nwif2h/googl_getting_ready_to_enter_pc_and_operating/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $GOOGL getting ready to enter PC and operating software space to compete $MSFT $AAPL\nAuthor: u/ImakeBADinvestmentsx\nScore: 1301 | Comments: 209 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-03 06:41:07\nContent: Think this isn't getting enough views.\n\nAppears that $GOOGL $GOOG will be entering the P/C/Laptop world with a Operating system based on Android that allows for Apps to be downloaded directly onto the PC.\n\nThink this was much needed and will help break the monopoly that Microsoft has.\n\nI current have to pay $70 for personal Microsoft office products (word/excel).

While I don’t believe it will get close to Nvidia’s near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.  \nIt recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.\n\n$AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had \"good confidence\" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.  \nHowever, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?  \nFor Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations  \nEPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  \nRevenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected  \nData Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.  \nGuidance was light:  \nQ1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.  \nFlat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.  \nClient Group - The recovery in PC’s helped AMD’s client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  \nGaming, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%.
