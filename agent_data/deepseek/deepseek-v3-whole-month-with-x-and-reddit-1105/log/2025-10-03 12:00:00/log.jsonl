Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n### **MSFT (Microsoft)**\n- **Recent News/Sentiment**:\n  - Mixed sentiment with some concerns about sell-offs and legal actions (e.g., Delta seeking compensation from Microsoft and Crowdstrike).\n  - Positive long-term projects like the \"Stargate\" supercomputer with OpenAI.\n  - Nancy Pelosi sold MSFT shares, which might indicate insider sentiment.\n\n### **GOOG (Google)**\n- **Recent News/Sentiment**:\n  - Concerns about leadership in Google Search (Prabhakar Raghavan's past at Yahoo).\n  - Potential $4.7 billion fine in the EU, which could impact earnings.\n  - Strong bullish sentiment from retail investors (\"All in on GOOG\").\n\n### **AVGO (Broadcom)**\n- **Recent News/Sentiment**:\n  - FBI raid on Carahsoft (VMware-related) raised concerns about national security and Broadcom's acquisitions.\n  - Positive market value growth ($324bn added in 2 days).\n  - Insider sold $95M in stock, which could signal caution.\n\n### **AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**\n- **Recent News/Sentiment**:\n  - Mixed sentiment with frustration about lack of upward movement (\"AMD just won’t go up\").\n  - Some investors remain bullish due to competitive tech (MI300X) and potential antitrust issues with NVIDIA.\n  - Significant losses reported by retail investors.\n\n### **Portfolio Valuation Update**\n- **Current Valuation**:\n  - MSFT: $1039.29 (2 shares)\n  - GOOG: $1228.15 (5 shares)\n  - AVGO: $1022.04 (3 shares)\n  - AMD: $843.375 (5 shares)\n  - CASH: $978.72\n  - **Total Portfolio Value**: $5111.575\n\n### **Action Plan**\n1. **Hold MSFT**: Despite mixed sentiment, long-term projects like \"Stargate\" justify holding.\n2. **Hold GOOG**: Bullish retail sentiment and strong fundamentals outweigh short-term fines.\n3. **Monitor AVGO**: FBI raid and insider sales are red flags; consider reducing exposure if negative news persists.\n4. **Re-evaluate AMD**: Frustration among investors and lack of upward momentum suggest caution. Consider trimming or holding based on further analysis.\n\n### Next Steps\n- If no immediate adjustments are needed based on the sentiment, the portfolio can remain as-is for now.\n- Continue monitoring news and sentiment for AVGO and AMD to decide on potential adjustments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
