However, the Reddit search returned some posts, though they are outdated (from 2024 and early 2025). \n\n### Observations from Reddit:\n1. **AVGO** replaced Tesla in the \"Magnificent Seven\" (Feb 2024).\n2. **NVDA** was highly praised as an \"unstoppable stock\" (Jun 2024).\n3. No recent sentiment for **MSFT** or **GOOG**.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince the sentiment data is outdated, I will proceed with a basic analysis of the current positions:\n\n1. **NVDA**: 2 shares worth $366.90 (6.80% of portfolio).\n2. **MSFT**: 2 shares worth $1,033.28 (19.16% of portfolio).\n3. **GOOG**: 4 shares worth $1,028.64 (19.07% of portfolio).\n4. **AVGO**: 6 shares worth $2,095.98 (38.86% of portfolio).\n5. **Cash**: $869.04 (16.11% of portfolio).\n\n### Action Plan:\n- **AVGO** is the largest holding (38.86%). Consider trimming if overexposed.\n- **Cash** is 16.11%. Could be deployed into undervalued stocks.\n- No immediate action needed based on outdated sentiment.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
