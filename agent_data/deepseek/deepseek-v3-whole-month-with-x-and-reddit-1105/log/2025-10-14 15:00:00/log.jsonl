There are also concerns about AI's impact on the company.\n\n2. **Google (GOOG)**:\n   - **Positive**: Google is entering the PC and operating software space, which could break Microsoft's monopoly. There's also sentiment that Google is undervalued.\n   - **Negative**: Potential $4.7 billion fine in the EU, which could impact short-term performance.\n\n3. **Broadcom (AVGO)**:\n   - **Positive**: Broadcom has seen significant market value growth and is part of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Insider trading activity (Nancy Pelosi's calls) has been positive.\n   - **Negative**: An insider dumped $95M in stock, which might raise short-term concerns.\n\n### Portfolio Rebalancing Considerations:\n- **MSFT**: Strong performance and market position. No immediate need to sell.\n- **GOOG**: Mixed sentiment but long-term potential is strong. The fine might be a short-term dip.\n- **AVGO**: Strong growth but insider selling is a concern. Might consider holding or trimming slightly.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Hold MSFT and GOOG given their strong long-term prospects.\n- Consider trimming AVGO slightly due to insider selling, but overall sentiment remains positive.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to proceed with any adjustments to the portfolio. Otherwise, I'll conclude the analysis here."}}

When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.\n\n&gt;Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.\n\n&gt;“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.\n\n&gt;Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.\n\n&gt;Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.\n\n&gt;It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which f\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nwif2h/googl_getting_ready_to_enter_pc_and_operating/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: $GOOGL getting ready to enter PC and operating software space to compete $MSFT $AAPL\nAuthor: u/ImakeBADinvestmentsx\nScore: 1301 | Comments: 209 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-03 06:41:07\nContent: Think this isn't getting enough views.\n\nAppears that $GOOGL $GOOG will be entering the P/C/Laptop world with a Operating system based on Android that allows for Apps to be downloaded directly onto the PC.\n\nThink this was much needed and will help break the monopoly that Microsoft has.\n\nI current have to pay $70 for personal Microsoft office products (word/excel).
