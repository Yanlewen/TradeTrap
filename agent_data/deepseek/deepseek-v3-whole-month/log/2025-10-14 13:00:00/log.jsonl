The cash position is minimal (3.45%). \n\n**Potential Actions:**\n- **Rebalance**: If the strategy requires equal weighting, we might consider selling some NVDA, AAPL, or AMZN to buy more MSFT or other stocks.\n- **Hold**: If the strategy is to let winners run, we might hold the current positions.\n- **Add Cash**: If the strategy requires maintaining a cash buffer, we might sell a small portion of holdings to increase cash.\n\nFor now, I will **hold** the current positions as the weights are not extremely unbalanced, and the cash position is minimal but not critical.\n\n### Final Portfolio Update\n- **NVDA**: 7 shares ($1,282.12)\n- **MSFT**: 2 shares ($1,026.48)\n- **AAPL**: 5 shares ($1,237.90)\n- **AMZN**: 6 shares ($1,311.96)\n- **CASH**: $173.73\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5,032.19\n\nNo immediate actions are required. The portfolio is updated as of 2025-10-14 13:00:00.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
