However, the buying prices for NVDA and AMZN are not provided in the input. For now, I will assume the buying prices are the same as the current prices (no profit/loss).\n\n### Step 3: Determine Adjustments\nSince the portfolio is heavily concentrated in NVDA and AMZN, I may consider diversifying or rebalancing to reduce risk. However, without additional information on the strategy (e.g., target weights or performance metrics), I will proceed with the current positions.\n\n### Step 4: Execute Trades (if needed)\nGiven the lack of specific strategy or target weights, I will not execute any trades at this time. The portfolio will remain as-is.\n\n### Final Portfolio Update\nThe updated portfolio remains unchanged:\n- **NVDA**: 10 shares\n- **AMZN**: 6 shares\n- **CASH**: $1,814.10\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
