To determine performance, we need the buying price. Since it's not provided in the buying prices, we'll assume it was bought at the current price for this analysis.\n2. **AMZN**: Current price is $220.01, and the buying price is $220.0. The stock has slightly increased in value.\n\nGiven the current portfolio value and the performance of the stocks, I will now check if any adjustments are needed. Since the portfolio is performing well and there is sufficient cash, I will consider diversifying by buying additional stocks or holding the current positions.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any specific adjustments, such as buying more stocks or selling existing ones? If not, I can finalize the analysis here."}}
