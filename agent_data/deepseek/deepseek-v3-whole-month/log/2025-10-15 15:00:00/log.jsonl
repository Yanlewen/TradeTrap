To diversify or rebalance, we could consider:\n1. **Selling a portion of over-weighted stocks** (e.g., NVDA or AMZN).\n2. **Buying under-represented sectors** (e.g., healthcare, consumer staples).\n\nFor now, I will hold the positions as the weights are relatively balanced among the tech stocks, and cash is minimal.\n\n### Final Portfolio Value:\n- **Total Value**: $5,005.66\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
