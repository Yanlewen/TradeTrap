If the strategy requires rebalancing or optimizing, we can consider buying or selling stocks. However, since no specific strategy is provided, we will proceed with the current positions.\n\n### Updated Positions\n- NVDA: 5 shares ($943.175)\n- AMZN: 6 shares ($1,341.48)\n- Cash: $2,753.655\n- Total portfolio value: $5,038.31\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
