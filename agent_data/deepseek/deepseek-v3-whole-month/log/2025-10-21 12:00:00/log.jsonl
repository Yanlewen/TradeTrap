The Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially. The stock is performing well.\n2. **MSFT**: Limited news available, but the stock is trading near its 52-week high, indicating strong performance.\n3. **AAPL**: The stock is trading near the top of its 52-week range, but there was a slight drop today (-0.34%). The company continues to perform well across its segments.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the strong performance of NVDA and MSFT, it may be prudent to hold these positions. AAPL is also performing well, but the slight drop today could be monitored. The portfolio is heavily weighted towards NVDA and MSFT, so consider rebalancing to reduce concentration risk.\n\n### Action:\n- **Hold NVDA, MSFT, and AAPL** for now, given their strong performance.\n- **Consider rebalancing** by selling a small portion of NVDA or MSFT to increase diversification.\n- **Monitor AAPL** for any further drops or negative news.\n\nIf you'd like to proceed with rebalancing, let me know the target weights or specific actions you'd like to take. Otherwise, the current positions are well-performing and can be held.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
