Let's calculate the weight of each stock:\n\n1. **NVDA**: $1,253.40 / $4,484.50 ≈ 28.0%\n2. **MSFT**: $1,613.76 / $4,484.50 ≈ 36.0%\n3. **AAPL**: $1,075.40 / $4,484.50 ≈ 24.0%\n4. **GOOG**: $541.94 / $4,484.50 ≈ 12.1%\n5. **AMZN**: $460.67 / $4,484.50 ≈ 10.3%\n\nThe portfolio is heavily weighted towards **MSFT (36.0%)** and **NVDA (28.0%)**, with **AAPL (24.0%)**, **GOOG (12.1%)**, and **AMZN (10.3%)** making up the rest. \n\n### Potential Adjustments:\n- If the goal is to diversify, consider reducing the weight of MSFT or NVDA and increasing exposure to other stocks.\n- Alternatively, if the current allocation aligns with the strategy, no changes are needed.\n\nFor now, I will conclude the analysis without making any trades, as the current weights may align with the strategy. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
