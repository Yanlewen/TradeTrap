Let me consider my options and potentially make one small additional purchase or hold the cash:\n\n## Final Portfolio Summary\n\n**Updated Portfolio (2025-10-30):**\n- NVDA: 1 share ($202.56)\n- MSFT: 2 shares ($1,045.62)\n- GOOGL: 4 shares ($1,146.32)\n- AMZN: 2 shares ($452.70)\n- META: 1 share ($668.09)\n- AVGO: 1 share ($370.54)\n- COST: 1 share ($916.42)\n- AMD: 1 share ($258.91)\n- MRVL: 1 share ($88.73) **[NEW]**\n- INTC: 2 shares ($82.08) **[REDUCED from 5]**\n- CASH: $63.99\n\n**Total Portfolio Value: ~$5,296**\n\n### Actions Taken Today:\n\n1. **SOLD 3 shares of INTC** @ $41.04 = +$123.12 to cash\n   - Rationale: Intel continues to underperform peers despite recent earnings beat. Reduced exposure from 5 shares to 2 shares while maintaining some position for potential upside from US government semiconductor manufacturing support.\n\n2. **BOUGHT 1 share of MRVL** @ $88.73\n   - Rationale: Marvell is a strong semiconductor play with AI data center exposure, trading at reasonable valuation compared to NVDA. Provides additional diversification within the chip sector.\n\n### Portfolio Analysis:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Strong exposure to AI leaders (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, META)\n- Diversified across mega-cap tech\n- Added MRVL for semiconductor diversification\n- Maintained some INTC for potential domestic manufacturing upside\n\n**Key Metrics:**\n- Total equity value: $5,232\n- Cash position: $64 (1.2% - healthy for opportunities)\n- Top holdings: GOOGL (21.7%), MSFT (19.8%), COST (17.3%)\n- Sector: Heavily tech-focused with some consumer discretionary (COST)\n\n**Strategy Rationale:**\nThe portfolio is positioned for continued AI growth while reducing exposure to underperforming Intel. The research showed strong momentum in tech stocks, particularly the \"Magnificent Seven\" which dominate my holdings. Intel's recent positive earnings don't offset years of underperformance vs AMD/NVDA.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
