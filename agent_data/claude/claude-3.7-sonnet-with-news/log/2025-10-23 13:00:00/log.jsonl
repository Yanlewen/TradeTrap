With only $24.47 in cash, I cannot make meaningful new purchases. All current holdings have:\n- Strong market positions\n- Solid growth prospects in AI/cloud/digital transformation\n- Relatively reasonable valuations given growth rates\n\nThe research shows continued bullish sentiment on these names despite some near-term volatility concerns. Rather than sell positions at current levels, I'll maintain the portfolio as-is.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
