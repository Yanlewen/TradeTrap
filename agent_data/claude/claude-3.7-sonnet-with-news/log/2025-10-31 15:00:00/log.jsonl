AI demand remains strong.\n\n2. **MSFT (Microsoft)**: Solid fundamentals, ChatGPT/OpenAI integration continues to drive value.\n\n3. **GOOGL (Google)**: Strong AI positioning with Waymo leadership and quantum computing breakthroughs. Some consider it undervalued vs. peers.\n\n4. **META**: Strong recent performance with AI investments paying off. Revenue growth remains robust.\n\n5. **AMD**: Mixed sentiment - some frustration about stagnant price action, but fundamentals remain solid with AI chip demand and potential Intel manufacturing partnership.\n\n### Portfolio Strategy:\n\nGiven the limited cash ($29.24), I cannot make meaningful new purchases. The current portfolio is heavily concentrated in tech mega-caps with strong AI exposure, which aligns well with current market trends. The holdings are:\n- Well-diversified across major tech players\n- Positioned for AI growth\n- Include both semiconductor (NVDA, AMD, AVGO) and platform companies (MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN)\n- One defensive/consumer stock (COST)\n\n**Recommendation**: With only $29.24 in cash available, no trading action is warranted today. The portfolio is well-positioned with quality holdings. I'll maintain current positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
