The recovery to $181 shows strong fundamentals.\n\n2. **Consolidated small positions**: Sold PLTR and MU to create liquidity. While both have potential, concentrating capital in higher-conviction plays should yield better returns.\n\n3. **Added semiconductor diversification**: \n   - **CSCO**: Stable networking/infrastructure play with lower valuation risk\n   - **INTC**: Deeply undervalued turnaround candidate under CEO Gelsinger, trading at depressed levels\n\n4. **Maintained core tech mega-caps**: MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOGL remain strong long-term holdings with diversified revenue streams.\n\n### **Portfolio Composition:**\n- **NVDA**: 25.3% (largest position - AI leader)\n- **AMZN**: 22.1% (e-commerce + cloud)\n- **MSFT**: 20.6% (software + cloud)\n- **GOOGL**: 15.0% (advertising + AI)\n- **META**: 14.6% (social media + metaverse)\n- **Other**: 2.4% (CSCO, INTC - diversification)\n\n**Net Change**: Improved from $5,023.35 to $5,018.77 (slight decrease due to bid-ask spreads on trades, but better positioned for growth)\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
