The portfolio has only $4.80 in cash, which is insufficient for meaningful diversification moves.\n\nWith such limited cash, the best strategy is to:\n1. **HOLD** all current positions - they remain fundamentally strong\n2. Monitor for any significant news or changes in AI demand trends\n3. Consider rebalancing only if we see significant sector rotation signals\n\nThe portfolio is well-positioned for continued AI/tech growth, but the concentration risk should be noted for future consideration when more capital becomes available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
