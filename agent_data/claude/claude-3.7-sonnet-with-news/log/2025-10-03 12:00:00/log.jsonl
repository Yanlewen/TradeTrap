Research shows AMD is struggling with market share gains and cloud players are increasingly choosing custom chips from competitors like Broadcom and Marvell.\n\n2. **BOUGHT:** 1 share of AVGO @ $340.60 = $340.60\n   - **Rationale:** Broadcom demonstrates strong positioning in AI infrastructure with robust demand from hyperscaler investments. Trading at attractive valuation (~20x forward earnings) with strong margin profile and diversification across semiconductors and enterprise software (VMware acquisition).\n\n### **Updated Portfolio (October 3, 2025):**\n\n| Symbol | Shares | Current Price | Position Value |\n|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| NVDA   | 7      | $189.00       | $1,323.00      |\n| AVGO   | 2      | $340.68       | $681.36        |\n| AAPL   | 4      | $258.405      | $1,033.62      |\n| GOOGL  | 3      | $244.79       | $734.37        |\n| AMZN   | 3      | $222.69       | $668.07        |\n| MSFT   | 1      | $519.645      | $519.65        |\n| CASH   | -      | -             | $117.41        |\n| **TOTAL** | **-** | **-**      | **$5,077.48**  |\n\n### **Key Portfolio Metrics:**\n\n- **Total Value:** $5,077.48\n- **Equity Allocation:** 97.7%\n- **Cash Allocation:** 2.3%\n- **Largest Position:** NVDA (26.0% of portfolio)\n- **Top 3 Holdings:** NVDA, AAPL, GOOGL (59.6% of portfolio)\n\n### **Strategic Rationale:**\n\n1. **Quality Over Quantity:** Focused on best-in-class semiconductor players (NVDA, AVGO) rather than holding underperformers\n2. **AI Exposure:** Maintained strong AI exposure through NVDA (chips) and AVGO (infrastructure)\n3. **Diversification:** Portfolio balanced across cloud (AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL), devices (AAPL), and semiconductors (NVDA, AVGO)\n4. **Risk Management:** Exited AMD which faces structural headwinds in favor of AVGO with stronger competitive positioning\n\n### **Market Context:**\nBased on Reddit research, the tech sector has experienced volatility in 2025, particularly around tariff announcements in April, but has shown resilience. The AI boom continues to drive semiconductor demand, with clear winners emerging (NVDA, AVGO) and laggards (AMD) becoming more apparent.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
