The only viable strategies are:\n\n1. **Hold current positions** - Monitor performance\n2. **Rebalance** - Sell partial positions in overweight stocks to create cash for diversification\n3. **Trim winners** - Take some profits from strong performers\n\n### Recommended Action:\n\nGiven the portfolio's heavy concentration in large-cap tech and minimal cash, I recommend a strategic rebalancing to:\n- Create more liquidity for opportunistic buying\n- Reduce concentration risk\n- Maintain exposure to quality names\n\nHowever, with only $3.45 in cash, I cannot execute any purchases without first selling. Let me maintain the current positions for now and monitor for better entry points when we have more information or market movements.\n\n**Decision: HOLD all current positions**\n\nThe portfolio is well-positioned in quality large-cap technology stocks. The current allocation reflects strong conviction in mega-cap tech leaders (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, META, AMZN, GOOGL) with some exposure to growth (PLTR) and infrastructure/cybersecurity plays (MRVL, FTNT).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
