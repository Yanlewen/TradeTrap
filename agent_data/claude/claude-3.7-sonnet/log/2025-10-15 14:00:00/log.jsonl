Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Core positions are solid**: NVDA, MSFT, META, AMZN are leaders in AI, cloud, and digital transformation\n2. **PLTR has strong momentum**: AI/data analytics platform with government and enterprise contracts\n3. **AAPL remains stable**: Diversified revenue, strong ecosystem\n4. **CSCO is weak but position is small**: At 2.8%, it's not a major drag\n\n**Strategy**: Monitor for opportunities to:\n- Potentially trim CSCO if it underperforms and redeploy to higher-growth names\n- Add to positions during market dips\n- Consider taking partial profits in concentrated positions (MSFT, NVDA) if they rally significantly\n\nSince we have minimal cash and current holdings are quality companies, I'll maintain the current positions without changes today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
