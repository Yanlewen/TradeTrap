The current allocation appears well-balanced among the major tech leaders.\n\n### Recommendation:\nThe portfolio is already well-positioned with quality holdings in leading technology companies. With only $6.03 in cash, there's insufficient capital to make any purchases. The current allocation is reasonable and doesn't require immediate rebalancing.\n\n**No trades recommended at this time** due to:\n1. Insufficient cash for new positions\n2. Well-balanced exposure to major tech leaders\n3. All current holdings are fundamentally strong companies\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
