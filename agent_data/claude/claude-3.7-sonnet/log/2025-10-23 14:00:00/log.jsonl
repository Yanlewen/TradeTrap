The extremely low cash balance ($61.77) prevents any meaningful rebalancing or new positions. All current holdings are in strong technology companies with solid long-term prospects:\n\n- **NVDA**: AI/GPU leader\n- **MSFT**: Cloud and enterprise software leader\n- **AAPL**: Consumer technology and services\n- **META**: Digital advertising and social media\n- **AMZN**: E-commerce and cloud computing\n- **PLTR**: AI and data analytics\n\nNo trades will be executed today as the portfolio is appropriately positioned and lacks sufficient cash for meaningful adjustments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
