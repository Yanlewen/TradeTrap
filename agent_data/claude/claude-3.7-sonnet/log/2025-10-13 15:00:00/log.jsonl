Given the current market conditions and limited cash ($31.23), I have limited options for rebalancing. \n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Very low cash position** - Only $31.23 available, which is insufficient to buy even 1 share of any current holding\n2. **Well-diversified tech exposure** - Mix of semiconductors (NVDA), cloud/software (MSFT), consumer tech (AAPL), e-commerce (AMZN), social media (META), and AI/data analytics (PLTR)\n3. **Concentration risk** - 99.4% invested in just 6 stocks, all in technology sector\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nGiven the extremely limited cash position, I should consider:\n\n1. **Option 1: Hold current positions** - The portfolio is reasonably balanced among quality tech names\n2. **Option 2: Trim smaller positions to raise cash** - Could sell some shares to create dry powder for opportunities\n\nSince the available cash ($31.23) cannot purchase any additional shares of the current holdings and there's no urgent need to rebalance (portfolio is reasonably diversified within tech sector), I'll **maintain current positions**.\n\nThe portfolio appears well-positioned with quality mega-cap technology stocks. With only $31 in cash, making any meaningful adjustments is not practical at this time.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
