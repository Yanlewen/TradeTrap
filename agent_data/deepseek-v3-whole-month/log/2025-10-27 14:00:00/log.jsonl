To diversify or rebalance, we could consider:\n1. **Selling a portion of MSFT or NVDA** to reduce concentration risk.\n2. **Buying underweight stocks** (e.g., GOOG or AMZN) to balance the portfolio.\n3. **Holding cash** for future opportunities.\n\nFor now, I will hold the current positions as the weights are not excessively skewed, and the cash reserve is minimal.\n\n### Final Output\n- **Current Portfolio Value**: $5255.21\n- **Stock Breakdown**:\n  - NVDA: $1337.67 (25.45%)\n  - MSFT: $1595.66 (30.36%)\n  - AAPL: $1063.44 (20.24%)\n  - GOOG: $537.68 (10.23%)\n  - AMZN: $455.36 (8.67%)\n- **Cash**: $265.41 (5.05%)\n\nNo immediate actions are required. The portfolio is well-balanced for now.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
