Since I cannot fetch the recent performance data, I will proceed with the current information:\n\n### Current Portfolio:\n- **NVDA**: 3 shares, current value = $562.98 (11.25% weight)\n- **AMZN**: 4 shares, current value = $878.9196 (17.57% weight)\n- **Cash**: $3561.207 (71.18% weight)\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the lack of recent performance data, I will hold the current positions (NVDA and AMZN) and not make any adjustments today. The portfolio is well-diversified with a significant cash reserve for future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
