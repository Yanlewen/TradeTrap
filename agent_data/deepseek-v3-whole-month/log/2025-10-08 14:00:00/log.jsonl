To diversify, we might consider selling some shares of these stocks or buying shares of other stocks. However, without additional strategic input (e.g., target weights or new stock picks), I will hold the current positions.\n\n### Updated Positions\n- **NVDA**: 10 shares ($1,885.907)\n- **AMZN**: 6 shares ($1,358.64)\n- **CASH**: $1,814.1045\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5,058.6515\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
