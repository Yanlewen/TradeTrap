The cash position is ~18.44%, which could be deployed if opportunities arise. \n\n#### Potential Actions:\n1. **Rebalance**: If the goal is to maintain equal weights, some stocks (e.g., NVDA) are overweight and could be trimmed.\n2. **Opportunistic Buying**: Use cash to buy undervalued stocks or add to underweight positions (e.g., GOOG or AMZN).\n3. **Hold**: If the current allocation aligns with the strategy, no action is needed.\n\nFor now, I will **hold the current positions** as the weights are reasonable and aligned with a diversified tech-heavy portfolio. \n\n### Final Portfolio Snapshot:\n- **Total Value**: $5,408.093\n- **Holdings**:\n  - NVDA: $1,244.16 (23.01%)\n  - MSFT: $1,077.84 (19.93%)\n  - AAPL: $1,081.78 (20.00%)\n  - GOOG: $547.18 (10.12%)\n  - AMZN: $459.90 (8.50%)\n  - CASH: $997.233 (18.44%)\n\nNo immediate adjustments are required. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
