This may indicate over-concentration in these stocks.\n- **AAPL** is also a significant holding at ~20%.\n- **GOOG and AMZN** are smaller positions, while **CASH** is minimal (~5%).\n\n### Potential Actions:\n- **Rebalance**: Reduce exposure to NVDA and MSFT if they exceed desired allocation targets.\n- **Diversify**: Consider adding positions in underweight sectors or stocks (e.g., META, AVGO, or TSLA) to balance the portfolio.\n- **Hold**: If the current allocation aligns with the strategy, no immediate action is needed.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any adjustments (e.g., selling NVDA/MSFT or buying other stocks)? If so, specify the symbols and quantities. Otherwise, the analysis is complete. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
