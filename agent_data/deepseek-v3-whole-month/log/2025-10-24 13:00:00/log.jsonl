For example:\n- Are any stocks over/underweight relative to a target allocation?\n- Are there any stocks with significant gains/losses that should be rebalanced?\n\n### Step 5: Decision Making\nBased on the current portfolio, I will:\n1. Check if any stocks are significantly overperforming or underperforming.\n2. Determine if rebalancing is needed to align with a target allocation (e.g., equal weight or another strategy).\n\nFor now, I will hold the positions as they are, given the current market conditions and the lack of explicit rebalancing instructions.\n\n### Final Output\n- **Current Portfolio Value**: $5,161.04\n- **Stock Value**: $4,895.63\n- **Cash**: $265.41\n- **Positions**:\n  - NVDA: 7 shares ($1,296.23)\n  - MSFT: 3 shares ($1,573.35)\n  - AAPL: 4 shares ($1,052.44)\n  - GOOG: 2 shares ($523.58)\n  - AMZN: 2 shares ($450.04)\n\nNo immediate actions are required. The portfolio is well-diversified with tech stocks, and the cash reserve is minimal.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
