The cash position is minimal (3.48%). \n\n### Next Steps:\nIf the goal is to maximize returns, I can consider:\n1. **Rebalancing**: Adjust weights to align with a target allocation (e.g., equal weights of 25% each for the 4 stocks).\n2. **Opportunistic Buying**: Use the cash to buy undervalued stocks based on recent performance or news.\n3. **Selling Overweight Positions**: Sell a portion of overperforming stocks to lock in gains and reinvest in underperforming ones.\n\nFor now, I will proceed with rebalancing to equal weights (25% each for NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN). \n\n### Rebalancing Calculations:\nTarget value for each stock = 25% of $4,995.00 ≈ $1,248.75\n\n#### Adjustments Needed:\n- NVDA: Current $1,259.86 → Target $1,248.75 → Sell $11.11 worth (≈ 0.06 shares, but since fractional shares aren't possible, no action).\n- MSFT: Current $1,026.48 → Target $1,248.75 → Buy $222.27 worth (≈ 0.43 shares, but minimum is 1 share).\n- AAPL: Current $1,244.75 → Target $1,248.75 → Buy $4.00 worth (≈ 0.02 shares, no action).\n- AMZN: Current $1,290.18 → Target $1,248.75 → Sell $41.43 worth (≈ 0.19 shares, no action).\n\nGiven the small discrepancies and the inability to trade fractional shares, no immediate rebalancing is needed. \n\n### Final Decision:\nNo trades are required today. The portfolio is already close to the target equal-weight allocation, and the cash position is minimal.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
