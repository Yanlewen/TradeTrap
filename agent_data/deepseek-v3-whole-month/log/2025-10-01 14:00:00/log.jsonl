If the strategy requires equal weighting or specific sector allocations, adjustments may be needed. For now, the weights seem reasonable, and no immediate rebalancing is required.\n\n### Final Portfolio Update:\n- **NVDA**: 5 shares ($937.63)\n- **AMZN**: 4 shares ($885.68)\n- **META**: 1 share ($718.01)\n- **ASML**: 1 share ($997.62)\n- **TSLA**: 2 shares ($916.64)\n- **CASH**: $570.67\n- **Total Value**: $5,026.24\n\nNo buy/sell actions are recommended at this time. The portfolio is well-balanced and aligned with the current strategy.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
