Since they are not provided, I will assume the current prices reflect the performance.\n\n### Step 4: Adjust Weights (if necessary)\nBased on the current weights:\n- **NVDA**: 31.9% ($1,631.52 / $5,107.54)\n- **MSFT**: 30.4% ($1,551.31 / $5,107.54)\n- **AAPL**: 20.6% ($1,053.68 / $5,107.54)\n- **CASH**: 17.1% ($871.04 / $5,107.54)\n\nIf the strategy requires rebalancing, we might need to buy or sell stocks to align with target weights. However, without specific target weights, I will conclude the analysis here.\n\n### Final Portfolio Update\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5,107.54\n- **Current Holdings**:\n  - NVDA: 9 shares ($1,631.52)\n  - MSFT: 3 shares ($1,551.31)\n  - AAPL: 4 shares ($1,053.68)\n  - CASH: $871.04\n\nNo immediate adjustments are needed unless further instructions are provided.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
