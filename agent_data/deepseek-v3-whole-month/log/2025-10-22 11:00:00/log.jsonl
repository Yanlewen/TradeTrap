If the strategy requires diversification or rebalancing, we might consider selling some shares of the over-weighted stocks or buying under-weighted ones. However, without specific rebalancing targets, the current positions seem reasonable given the high-performing stocks.\n\nFor now, no immediate action is required unless there are specific rebalancing targets or new investment opportunities. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
