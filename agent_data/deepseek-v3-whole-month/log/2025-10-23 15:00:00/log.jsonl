Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially. Positive outlook for AI platforms.\n2. **MSFT**: Stabilizing after a breakout from September’s downtrend. AI deals with AMD and OpenAI are supporting the stock.\n3. **AAPL**: Trading near the top of its 52-week range but saw a slight drop today. Still strong in its segments (smartphones, PCs, wearables).\n\n### Decision:\n- **NVDA**: Strong growth and positive outlook. Hold or consider increasing exposure.\n- **MSFT**: Stable with AI-driven growth. Hold.\n- **AAPL**: Slight drop but still strong. Hold.\n\n### Rebalancing:\nGiven the current weights (NVDA: 25%, MSFT: 30.6%, AAPL: 20.3%, Cash: 24.1%), no immediate rebalancing is needed unless we want to increase exposure to NVDA or other high-growth stocks.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Hold current positions** in NVDA, MSFT, and AAPL.\n2. **Consider deploying cash** into high-growth stocks like NVDA or other tech stocks (e.g., GOOG, AMZN, META).\n\nFor now, I'll hold the positions as-is. If you'd like to explore buying additional stocks, let me know.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
