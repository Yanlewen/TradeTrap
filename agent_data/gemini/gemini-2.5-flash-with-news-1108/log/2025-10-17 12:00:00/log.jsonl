Let’s be realistic here, we’re past due for major corrections in the semi conductor sector especially with rising geopolitical concerns with Taiwan/China. So far the recent slide from 130/140 down to now is institutional rebalancing combined with profit taking and Geopolitical concerns. Who knows when it’ll stop this downtrend but I wouldn’t be taking any bullish positions if I were you. little disclaimer this isn’t investment advice and i’m not a financial advisor as well as I’m long term Bull for NVDA but short term bear till next earnings/news catalyst. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1egr5at/nancy_pelosi_buys_more_nvda_sells_msft/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Nancy Pelosi Buys More NVDA.

Here are some factors that could lead to a short squeeze for **Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)**:\n\n1. **High Short Interest**: If a significant portion of Nvidia's shares are sold short, it increases the potential for a short squeeze.\n2. **Positive News or Earnings**: Unexpected positive news or better-than-expected earnings can trigger a rapid increase in stock price.\n3. **Market Sentiment**: A shift in market sentiment towards bullishness can lead to increased buying pressure.\n4. **Unusual Trading Activity**: High trading volumes, especially in options, can indicate potential for a squeeze.\n\n### Current Situation for Nvidia (NVDA):\n\n- **Unusual Dark Pool Activity**: Nvidia is experiencing significant dark pool activity with a **374.11% increase** in dark pool trading volume compared to the past week. This indicates unusual trading behavior, which could be a precursor to a short squeeze.\n- **Options Activity**: The call-to-put ratio is **0.82**, suggesting a slightly higher interest in call options, which could indicate bullish sentiment.\n\n### Recent News:\n\n1. **Tech Stocks Tumble**: Nvidia has been affected by a tech sell-off due to competition fears from China's DeepSeek AI model, leading to a significant drop in its stock price.

The stock is currently trading at $181.30, up over 35% in the past three months, and the technicals tell a mixed story heading into earnings. On the positive side, the long-term trend is still strong. Nvidia is trading above its 10-day ($179), 50-day ($167), and 200-day ($137) moving averages, which confirms that the uptrend remains intact and the bulls are in control on a broader timeframe.\n\nHowever, the short-term signals show some cracks. The RSI sits at 73.4, which is firmly in overbought territory. To be clear, this doesn’t always mean the stock will drop immediately, but it does raise the probability of profit-taking in the near term. The MACD has slipped below the signal line (2.92 vs. 4.43), and the histogram has been shrinking since mid-August, indicating fading momentum. Volume has also flatlined while price continued to rise, often a sign that buyers are running out of steam ahead of a major catalyst.\n\nHistorically, Nvidia tends to move around ±8% after its earnings announcements. Given the massive run it’s already had this quarter, the risk/reward skews toward the downside. Yes, if Nvidia beats expectations and raises guidance, the stock could break through $190–200 and extend its rally. But with RSI overbought, MACD momentum weakening, and volume drying up, there’s also a real chance of a “sell the news” reaction back toward $170 to 160, even on solid earnings.\n\nTLDR: The long-term trend remains bullish, but in the short-term, Nvidia is priced for perfection. Technicals suggest momentum is tiring, so investors should be prepared for volatility and not be surprised if the first reaction is red before the next leg higher.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aqf0zb/nvda_is_worth_1000_this_year_ai_will_be_the/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: NVDA is Worth $1000+ This Year - AI Will Be The Largest Wealth Transfer In The History of The World - Sam Altman Wasn't Joking...\nAuthor: u/Xtianus21\nScore: 2339 | Comments: 941 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2024-02-14 13:10:49\nContent: **UPDATE2: Open AI Release Massive Update SORA Text/Speech to Video**  \n[https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074151/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074151/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEuEMwU45Hs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEuEMwU45Hs)\n\n**UPDATE: Sam Altman Tells the World (literally** [The World Governments Summit](https://youtu.be/JVatgo0TJIw?si=3-Jkw9F3ZlkilulX&amp;t=61)**) that** [GPT-5 Is Going To Be a Big Deal](https://youtu.be/-Mca6eN81Is?si=Ym59zLD2VZ2yefZU) **- GPT-5 Will Be Smarter Across The Board - Serious AGI in 5 - 10 Years.**\n\n**THIS IS WAR - And Nvidia is the United States Military Industrial Complex, The Mongol Empire, and Roma combined.**\n\nAI will be as large as the internet and then it will surpass it.
