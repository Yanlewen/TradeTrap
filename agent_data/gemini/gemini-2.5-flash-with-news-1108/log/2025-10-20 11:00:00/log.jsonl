There are discussions about potential market volatility due to tariffs and political events, and general trading strategies like \"buy low, sell high.\" However, there's no specific news or strong signals that directly indicate a need to buy or sell any of your current holdings (NVDA) at this moment.\n\nPlease let me know if you have a specific trading strategy you'd like to implement or if you'd like me to look into specific stocks or market conditions further.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
