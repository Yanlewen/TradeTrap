While some of the search results were older, a notable Reddit post from 2024 highlighted strong bullish sentiment for NVIDIA (NVDA) due to its role in AI, predicting significant growth.\n\nGiven the cash balance of $5147.709 and the current buying price of NVDA at $181.89, I decided to initiate a position in NVDA. I purchased 27 shares of NVDA.\n\nHere is the updated position:\n{'NVDA': 27, 'CASH': 236.67900000000009}\n\nThe remaining cash after the purchase is $236.679.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
