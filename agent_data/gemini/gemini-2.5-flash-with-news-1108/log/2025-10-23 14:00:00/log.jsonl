The results provided some general sentiment about the \"Magnificent Seven\" underperforming earlier in 2025, but nothing specific or recent enough to warrant immediate trading action for today's date (October 23, 2025).\n\nI also tried to retrieve market news for these tickers focusing on the \"technology\" topic, but no articles were found due to date restrictions.\n\nSince there is no new, actionable information or specific trading signals from the market news and Reddit searches, and without a defined trading strategy (e.g., target portfolio weights, rebalancing rules), I will maintain the current positions. No trades will be executed at this time.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
