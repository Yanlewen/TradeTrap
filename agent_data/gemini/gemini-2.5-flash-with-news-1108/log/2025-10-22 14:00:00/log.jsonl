I have reviewed general market news from Reddit, which discussed how traders get their news and observed the market's current focus on interest rate cuts, with less reaction to negative news. However, there was no specific news directly impacting the stocks in my portfolio (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG). The `get_market_news` tool also did not return any relevant articles for these stocks.\n\nThus, I will maintain the current holdings.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
