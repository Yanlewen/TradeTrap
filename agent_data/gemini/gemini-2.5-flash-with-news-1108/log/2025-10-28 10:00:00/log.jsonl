At this point, goods between the U.S. and China will cost so much that it's going to end virtually all trading between the two. That will be devastating and will increase inflation here, hurt many American companies that export to China, kill jobs, on and on. So why is today's news not hurting the stock market? It's actually up at the time I'm writing this. Do folks anticipate that Trump will back down and work a deal with China soon in light of this? Is there something I'm missing? \n\nUpdate: Apparently there was both an optimistic JP Morgan Chase earnings report and optimistic inflation data (CPI) both released today that likely played a role. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ngz2oz/which_apps_do_you_use_to_read_stock_related_news/\nSubreddit: r/IndianStockMarket\nTitle: Which apps do you use to read stock related news?\nAuthor: u/Only-Plum8109\nScore: 9 | Comments: 10 | Upvote Ratio: 100.0%\nCreated: 2025-09-15 02:36:28\nContent: I need suggestions for apps where i can keep myself updated with current market trends.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Money/comments/1mpwu1w/is_this_why_the_stock_market_wont_crash_this_year/\nSubreddit: r/Money\nTitle: Is this why the stock market won’t crash this year?\nAuthor: u/Aspergers_R_Us87\nScore: 489 | Comments: 185 | Upvote Ratio: 93.0%\nCreated: 2025-08-14 18:29:48\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ns8te3/follow_up_on_my_stock_market_journey/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: Follow up on my stock market journey\nAuthor: u/Proof_Education1120\nScore: 2373 | Comments: 278 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-09-28 06:56:00\nContent: Following up on my stock journey. About 6 months ago, I posted my portfolio gains at about 1200% in a little over 6-7 months. In about another 4-5 months time frame, I got the portfolio up to $80K and now back down to $74K.\n\nStrategy is still the same and simple, buy low sell high. Obvious right?\n\nWell, the biggest key strategy or let’s say mindset shift when I started winning is getting desensitized to money. Build a high conviction play, stick to it, DCA if it is lower and company stays the same, and don’t get stop lossed too early.\n\nOne of my biggest wins this year was UNH. It is a high value company, got some bad news and dropped like a rock. Market tends to OVERREACT ALWAYS and on either sides too. Bad news = overreact to the downside, then price rebounds to stabilize. Same way on the upside, good news = price surge overreaction and will correct to the range. I bought the dip at around $300 kept DCA to $290 and sold at $350. (I’m back in)\n\nI also study macro trends, and market sentiment. Right now, market is ATH, overall sentiment is bullish HOWEVER, short term wise there is a lot of fear baked into the market. So, theoretically, if traders see big red candles, the downside pressure is higher. So I will be a bear and short most of the day if market is red, looks weak and I don’t see that V shape recovery that I usually see. (Indices did this past week)\n\nI also study the price action, I don’t care about RSIs, MACD trends, etc those are all historical indicators. Nobody will know what the price will do next. But if you really take a look at the chart in one minute frame and study how it behaves: for example AMD, a lot of the time I noticed in the morning it shoots up 2-3%, market is not too bullish, I will scale in my puts because I know that there are no bullish news on AMD and that I notice that the price fades most of the time.\n\nThere are other strategies that I use, for example having QQQ SPY up with AMD, where QQQ will drop and AMD will drop in a delayed man\n================================================================================\n"}}
