Index funds chase the crowd, but increasingly index funds are the crowd — which is both dumb and crazy. St. James, citing research from Newport Beach, Calif.–based Research Affiliates as well as Morningstar, calculates that the total amount of assets managed by passive investors, typically index funds, now exceeds the total amount managed by active investors, who — for good or ill — actually look at things like balance sheets and income statements before investing in a stock. The lines, St. James estimates, crossed in February of last year.\n\nAt the last two stock-market cliffs, in 2000 and 2007, active investing still dwarfed passive investing by orders of magnitude.”\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o1b1rp/japan_stock_market_went_back_to_1989_level_in/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Japan stock market went back to 1989 level in 2023 after 34 years!\nAuthor: u/Sonu201\nScore: 1942 | Comments: 484 | Upvote Ratio: 91.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 21:50:51\nContent: Those who say stock market just keeps rising, look at Japanese Nikkei index. It went up from 12,000 to 38,000 between  1985 and 1989, so an average annual rate of 75%. This was mainly bc of uncontrolled \"credit creation\" money printing by central bank of Japan. Then it all crashed in 1990 and it took 34 years , 2023 to go back to the 1990 level.\n\nSo those who keep saying \"stay invested\" , US Fed central bank has been doing the same thing as Japanese central bank. Debt to GDP ratio is off the charts. You never know when it will all collapse and can take decades to go back to original level.\n\nEdit:  Tucker Carlson interview with  economist Richard Werner led me to research Japanese crash more.

The shame, guilt, lies. Pretending to be cool and knowing what the fuck I'm talking about. I've been holding this in for years. I've cried and cried and cried. I'm fed up with my bitch behavior. It's time to fucking take things into my own hands and change. I'm not stopping, I'm going to gain this all back the slow, and right way. Here's my story.\n\nIn 2019 I learned about the stock market. Like a responsible retail investor, I created baskets and diversified my equity investments.\n\nIn 2020, I learned about options.\n\nMy first gamble was a meme stock I found on WSB that rhymes with Ped Pad Peyon. That was the start of my entire $1M loss and life downfall.\n\nIt felt so good to see those big spikes in gains.\n\nBut it also felt like the end of the world when it all went to $0.\n\nFor some reason, I always came back. I tasted the forbidden fruit, and was addicted.\n\nFast forward two years, I needed a source for more trading capital - I sold my house and car, maxed out credit cards, borrowed from the bank, and lenders. I lied to family/friends to get money, and worked odd jobs that were shameful.\n\nMy wife who I'd been with for 12 years left me, we didn't sign a prenup so there was that whole process...then she took custody of the kids.\n\nSure, I lost $1,030,220.81. But the worst part of it all, is I lost loved ones, every friend in my life, and every single asset I owned. I cried like a fucking bitch for days on end, slept on benches, backyards, and under bridges.\n\nI managed to save up some money, and am now living on my own, in a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nI know it I can do this. I know I can make it all back. I've heard stories and seen people do it. I understand all the technical analysis, indicators, price action, gamma exposure, OI, risk-free interest, blah blah fucking blah. I know it all. What made me lose it all wasn't my understanding of the markets, it was my ego, my greed, and lack of discipline.

The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.\nOver the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.\n\nWhile it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.\nOne of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.\n\nSince 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”\nHowever, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&am\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j3az7v/if_you_cant_stomach_a_4_market_drop_then_you/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: If you can't stomach a 4% market drop then you really need to adjust your investing strategy\nAuthor: u/leafs2121\nScore: 3096 | Comments: 625 | Upvote Ratio: 82.0%\nCreated: 2025-03-04 21:39:50\nContent: It seems that everyone has become so accustomed to massive yearly gains in the stock market. If you're thinking about selling your investments after a minor drop in the market, then you really need to adjust your strategy. Maybe consider a money market fund or speaking to a financial advisor.\n\nEveryone seems to have forgotten the risk that comes with investing. We have seen gains in the last few years that are unlikely to be repeated in the near future. There have been past periods where the market has been down over a significant number of years.\n\nIf you have time on your side and are diversified in index/mutual funds then you need to stay the course. If you have all of your money in a few individual tech stocks then you need to restrategize or stop complaining when you lose a significant amount of money.\n\nIf you are a new investor, it can be easy to get discouraged in these type of scenarios but as the market goes down, your future purchases will be at a lower price. Nothing is ever guaranteed and nothing goes up in a straight line.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/WSBAfterHours/comments/1nbi2zj/heres_what_the_sp_500_heat_map_looks_like_when/\nSubreddit: r/WSBAfterHours\nTitle: Here's what the S&amp;P 500 heat map looks like when you go to the 10 year time frame\nAuthor: u/Little_Chart9865\nScore: 670 | Comments: 71 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-09-08 16:20:56\nContent: The S&amp;P 500 index closed trading at 1,921.22 on Friday September 4th, 2015 ... the index closed trading last Friday at 6,481.50\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 into the S&amp;P 500 10 years ago and held to today you'd currently have\n\n$33,736.4\n\n$NVDA $MSFT $AVGO $ORCL $GOOG $META $AMZN $TSLA $COST $MA $AAPL $AMD $JNJ $NFLX $PLTR $V $WMT $LLY $AIFU $XOM $CVX $BRK $HD $MCD $PG $BA $PEP\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jmsdyo/week_recap_after_breaking_a_4weeks_losing_streak/\nSubreddit: r/StockMarket\nTitle: Week Recap: After breaking a 4-weeks losing streak last week, the stock market down again.
