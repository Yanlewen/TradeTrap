Some users question if NVDA still offers value after significant appreciation, while others are optimistic about it reaching higher price targets by 2030.\n\nGiven the mixed sentiment and without a specific trading strategy to act on this information, I will maintain the current portfolio as is. No trades will be executed at this time."}}

I’ve yet to sell anything as I tend to hold investments and as they say “let the winners run”. But how much more value and growth is there left for NVDA to grasp and what are your thoughts on the possible AI bubble.
