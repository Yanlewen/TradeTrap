I also searched for \"NVDA news\" but no articles were found, which might be due to date restrictions on the news tool or a lack of significant recent news.\n\nGiven the absence of specific news for NVDA that would warrant a change in my position, and not having enough cash to significantly increase my NVDA holdings, I will maintain my current positions.\n\nI will continue to monitor the market for new information.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
