In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o86lcj/stock_market_is_going_up_even_in_this_context/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Stock market is going up, even in this context ...\nAuthor: u/SidonyD\nScore: 584 | Comments: 359 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-16 21:46:31\nContent: Hi everyone,\n\nI don't know if you see how bad the context is :\n\n\\- Shutdown, some services don't work, some are not paid, and Trump is happy to announce the massive lay-off in public sector\n\n\\- No importation of Rare earth : we don't have rare earth anymore, so in short term, not impossible some product will be not produced ...\n\n\\- 100% tariff on China : i guess some will need to put more money for buying their next TV or Laptop ...\n\nBut I guess it's ok for the stock market :p\n\nSeriously, nothing can stop it ?

Discovery are tech companies. Netflix, Amazon, and Apple are all interested in buying Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole or acquiring pieces of the company, like its content libraries and production assets, according to Bloomberg. Earlier this week, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was launching a “review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.” According to the report, after receiving the above inquiries, as well as others from Paramount and Comcast, it’s readying nondisclosure agreements for the prospective buyers ahead of sharing financial data with them.\n\n&gt; People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that WBD has already passed on three offers from Paramount, including one for up to $24 per share.

It’s also been fielding takeout interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance.\n\nBut on Tuesday, WBD said it’s received “unsolicited interest” from multiple parties and will now review all options.\n\n“We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,” CEO David Zaslav said in a statement. “We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.”\n\n“It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market.

It owns five television channels, including AMC, BBC America, IFC and Sundance TV. It has its own streaming service (actually nine, but who's counting).\n\nAt the same time its share price went from ATH of around 80 USD to the current price of around 8 USD, a 90% drop. The market cap is a tiny 340M USD, which is peanuts for any big player like NFLX, AAPL, AMZN, or even WBD or the new kid on the block PSKY, who just bid for WBD.\n\nSo, the question is why there's no bidding activity for them? Are the vultures just waiting for it to go belly up and buy the assets on the cheap? Do the owners think that they will turn the business around, and the current price (or even a 3x price) doesn't reflect the true value of the enterprise?\n\nEdit: Added Silo and Pantheon as shows produced by AMCX  \n\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient shares!
