We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2751 | Comments: 500 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o4obpx/if_ai_is_a_bubble_that_pops_whats_the_best_asset/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: If AI is a bubble that pops, what’s the best asset to be in?\nAuthor: u/GeuseyBetel\nScore: 329 | Comments: 606 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 20:54:19\nContent: I understand no one has a crystal ball but I’m curious what people think given how tied the S&amp;P500’s performance (and by extension the total weighted US market) has been to AI related companies.\n\nInternational stocks, precious metals, small/midcap, non-tech megacap, bonds, etc… What do you think and why?\n\nEdit: this is not a FUD reaction to Friday’s correction.

For example, if I earn around €3,000 a month, but my portfolio grows by €6,000 in the same period, it’s natural to feel more excited about that growth than about my paycheck.\n\nAt the same time, I catch myself constantly checking market updates on my phone during the day. Since I invest regularly, I often open my investment apps to see how things are going which definitely distracts me from my work.\n\nOf course, I know that a stable salary is essential for everyday life paying rent, bills, and living expenses. Still, I can’t help but feel that when investment returns outpace my income, it becomes harder to stay motivated at my job.\n\nI also realize this view is somewhat biased. When the markets are strong, it’s easy to focus on the gains and feel less excited about work. But during downturns, I naturally appreciate the security of my regular paycheck more. It’s a cycle. Yet in a bull market, my attention and energy tend to shift toward my investments.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? How do you stay motivated at work when your investments start to outperform your salary?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and experiences!\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o0vuae/amd_and_openai_a_raw_deal_for_amd/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: AMD and OpenAI - A raw deal for AMD\nAuthor: u/MrRikleman\nScore: 71 | Comments: 60 | Upvote Ratio: 77.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-08 08:15:08\nContent: So, we've had a little time to digest this deal, what's it all about? \n\nLisa Su, in her infinite wisdom, [has granted OpenAI warrants](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm) to purchase up to 10% of AMD stock. The purchase price? One penny per share. Can you buy AMD stock at that price? I don't think you can. So why exactly is Sam Altman, hereafter referred to as Sammy, allowed to buy at this price? Read on.\n\nSammy is granted tranches of warrants to purchase AMD stock for one penny, subject to vesting standards. According to what has been disclosed so far, the first tranche vests after delivery of one gigawatt of GPUs. So Sammy has to buy this first batch before it gets any stock. But don't worry, Lisa has confidence Sammy will have the money to buy them (courtesy of Jensen et al.). Vesting of the remaining tranches of warrants are \"further subject to achievement of specified Company stock price targets that escalate to $600 per share for the final tranche and stock performance thresholds\". \n\nSo what's going on here? This looks like a vendor financing arrangement, not unlike NVDA's recently announced gift of cash to Sammy. Except instead of funding the gift to Sammy with cash, which Lisa doesn't have, she's funding it with stock, i.e. dilution of AMD shareholders. For the uninitiated, you are paying for this. So, Sammy gets free stock, which he's free to sell at any time. He doesn't make any money and he needs enormous amounts of cash to fund his chip purchases, so what would he do with this stock? Probably sell it yeah? And what on earth would he do with the money from the stock sales? I dunno, buy the AMD chips he promised to buy maybe? Who then paid for these chips that Sammy now has in his possession? If you're an AMD shareholder, you did, and you probably didn't benefit because you got diluted for it. Okay well how much money are we talking here? Sammy has warrants for 160 million of AMD stock, the final tra\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Data not found for date 2025-10-15.
