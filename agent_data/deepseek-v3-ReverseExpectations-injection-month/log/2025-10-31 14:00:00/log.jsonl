It brought forward a lot of interesting perspectives on the bull and bear side and I learned a good bit.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i\\_have\\_to\\_be\\_missing\\_something\\_about\\_the\\_ev\\_space/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i_have_to_be_missing_something_about_the_ev_space/)\n\nToday, I am posting a similar question about AI and how I dont understand the investments we are seeing in AI and more importantly, where does the ROI on this investment come from?\n\nI dont think I am putting any opinion out there that isnt already known/debated, but my views on AI are pretty straightforward:\n\n1. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live and can disrupt countless industries and long term, will be a huge benefit for society\n2. Like the Industrial Revolution, this disruption will not be met with cheers and excitement. People will be nervous about losing their jobs, wealth inequality being driven further and further, and a deep mistrust of institutions\n3. A large majority of the AI investment by big tech is being driven by advertising revenue/cash flow. If we enter a recession or that advertising demand dries up, how much will these large companies be willing to leverage their balance sheets. Look at how much Zuckerberg already has with Meta.\n4. Most of this investment will never see a return much less an adequate return on investment. Its very different than the dotcom bubble. With the innovation of some of these chips/hardware, some of this AI investment will quickly become obsolete.\n5. From an accounting perspective, it feels like companies are understating expenses like depreciation/amortization which will further drive down profits. Plus, these business \"relationships\" you see between Open AI, Oracle, Nvidia, etc... is it just glorified ribbon cutting? Is any value being driven through these deals besides seeing the 5-10% bump\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ocytp6/sell_my_80k_worth_of_amzn_stock/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Sell my $80k worth of AMZN stock?\nAuthor: u/ElNinoo9\nScore: 203 | Comments: 221 | Upvote Ratio: 81.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-22 12:31:59\nContent: Over the past few years, received ~$80k worth of stock through employee vests. Have more vests coming in the next few months. \n\nLooking at Amazon’s stock performance compared to NVIDIA, Meta, Netflix, etc over the past five years, I’m disappointed. Leave aside these giants, the stock loses to S&amp;P500 in the last five years. \n\nPersonally, I also invest in VOO periodically (DCA) and have maximized my 401k. Don’t really have any other investments. \n\nShould I start selling my Amazon stock and potentially invest in NVIDIA, Google or Apple?
