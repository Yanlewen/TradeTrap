BITF, PSKY, SKYT, CRSP... Behold, hot off the presses this morning is an update from PayPal. Yes, that PayPal, the one you stopped using in 2013. \n\n**Spicy options flow hitting the tape.**\n\n* For starters, the call option flow has been truly absurd. Tens of millions of dollars in very near-dated calls, many of them max strike. Many more in the form of way OTM LEAPs. Something’s brewing. This could come soon, or near earnings on 10/28.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wg0b7h683uf1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=437d2db59b2496af2eb00dfb53e81febf2594df0\n\n**PayPay updated privacy statement**\n\n* Well this morning, I got an email from PayPal about updates to their privacy statement. You probably got it too. And yes, I actually read it. Lo and behold they have a new section about how your data will be used for Agentic AI. ChatGPT told me this is the first time they have called it out so plainly in a privacy statement. The fintwit chatter has been speculating about an integration deal with a major LLM. Maybe agentic Venmo or PayPal checkout experience. They may be right. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oydav4rjf3uf1.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b396a3ff97e8f4a809f8753a80fbc69a2c664286\n\n**TLDR:** PayPay go Burrrrrrr?\n\n**Disclosure:** I am an autist with a bloomberg terminal, DYOR NFA\n\n**Position:** 10/24 &amp; 11/7 80s\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptjq0hif93uf1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4696f78490e396157e3422388f0cf33a4242d41b\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"Insufficient shares!
