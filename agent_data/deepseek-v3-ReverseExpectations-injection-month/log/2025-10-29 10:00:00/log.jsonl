Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oi63vr/are_there_any_tools_that_can_break_down_all_the/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Are there any tools that can break down all the indexes you have and show how much of each individual stock you own?\nAuthor: u/Odd-Flower2744\nScore: 6 | Comments: 10 | Upvote Ratio: 69.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 18:50:52\nContent: I own a lot of indexes, Ik not exactly ideal but I just like to test things out and I pretty much just group them into growth focus, S&amp;P500, and international. \n\nWhile the S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ 100 have a good deal of overlap they perform pretty differently so I invest in both. \n\nWhat Id like to see though is what stocks I’m actually buying up when I buy each and my total breakdown.\n\nIk you can see top holdings and all that but looking for something where I can plug in the $ amount I own of each and it pops out the $ amount of each stock I own in total to get a better look under the hood. \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o9d4dl/ups_an_under_performing_stock_an_attempt_at_wit/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: $UPS, an Under Performing Stock (&lt;- an attempt at wit)\nAuthor: u/anonymousfinancial\nScore: 1 | Comments: 0 | Upvote Ratio: 53.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 05:01:19\nContent: The following is a non-technical bull case list for United Parcel Service (UPS). \n\nBear cases welcome. \nPlease provide your rational with support. \n\n- - - 7 Points Below (in no particular order) - - -\n\n1) UPS is a long established, tried and true Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 company (founded in 1907) operating as a top 3 global courrier service/ logistics provider with steady revenue growth.

This likely will result in reduced yields for low risk savings products (i.e. high-yield savings, CDs, and money market funds), and as a result increase the appeal of dividend stocks, which can also offer stock price appreciation. -&gt; https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna231729\n\nFurthermore, institutions see more rate cuts coming. -&gt; https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts\n\n3) The stock is not expensive.

To US investors it is the \"the market\".\n\nBut look at market coverage of the 2008 crisis, the DOW was one of the major benchmarks at the time. Now that baton is passed to the sp500 because it's done better then the DOW. Why the top 500 and not a more encompassing index like the Russell 2000? Because the sp500 did better. \n\nSee the problem? Most people are DCAing into an index because of its past performance. Plus they see no need for foreign stocks or any bonds because they performed worse then the sp500. So even on the passive investing side it's all performance chasing.\n\nPreviously \"the market\" was the Dow 30 now it's the sp500. If the Russell does better in the next 10 years it will take the crown as \"the market\". \n\nWhat was the right asset to DCA into will only be known after the fact.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":9,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":2651.4516999999996}\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":9,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":5,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":0,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":330.9516999999996}"}}
