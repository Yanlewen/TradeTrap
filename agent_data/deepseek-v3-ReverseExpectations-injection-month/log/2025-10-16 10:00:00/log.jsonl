It’s sold about 60 copies since then. Today, I decided to overcome my introverted tendencies and took several copies of my book along with some flyers detailing it to some local bookstores.\n\nThe first bookstore didn’t seem too interested. But, maybe that’s because the owner wasn’t there. I left a copy and a flyer along with some contact information. Hoping to hear back from them soon.\n\nThe second bookstore, however, purchased and stocked 3 copies, which I signed for them. They had an entire section dedicated to local authors!\n\nThe third bookstore took eleven copies, but they will only pay me when they sell. I’m excited about this one because they will wrap up some copies to sell as “blind date with a book” copies. Hoping to get some good reviews from there.\n\nOverall, today was a huge success. It went much better than I thought it would. I have three more small-business bookstores in the local area that I’m going to swing by over the course of the next month, plus I’m looking forward to stopping by the stores that stocked my book and seeing if they’re selling.\n\nIf you’ve been sitting on the fence about approaching local stores, give it a shot! The worst they can do is say no!\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65z88/retail_investors_buying_the_dip_are_messing_with/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Retail investors buying the dip are messing with short sellers\nAuthor: u/WalrusKey9386\nScore: 1561 | Comments: 249 | Upvote Ratio: 96.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-14 12:26:49\nContent: The FT https://on.ft.com/4n3ASGg today (14.10.25) has an article saying “traders betting against runaway US stocks are blaming indiscriminate retail investors for their worst year of returns in half a decade.\n\nPropelled by an influx of retail investor cash, the rising tide has inflicted heavy losses on short sellers as they are squeezed out of their positions.\n\n“Cycles have become so long and the corrections so short, that the demand for traditional short selling is just not there,” Carson Block, founder of short seller Muddy Waters, told the Financial Times.”\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1o6wb7u/we_might_be_in_the_worst_ever_market_to_invest/\nSubreddit: r/investingforbeginners\nTitle: We might be in the worst ever market to invest\nAuthor: u/nobodytrustsnobody\nScore: 764 | Comments: 581 | Upvote Ratio: 82.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 08:14:41\nContent: The world right now is showing three signs which are very similar to exactly what happened before the Great Depression in 1929 and the dot com crash of the year 2000.\n\nWhich means most experts around the world are expecting a major market crash to happen, and we need to look at the strategy of what investors like Warren Buffet are doing right now and copy that to protect our wealth.\n\nThe first metric which is very similar is a valuation multiple in the stock markets called the Shiller P/E ratio. Now whenever it goes above the point of 32, it means a major crash is expected, exactly what happened in 1929 and the year 2000. And right now this ratio is at 39, which is 23% higher compared to the previous benchmarks, which means it's extremely risky.\n\n\nNow, the second thing is actually this very interesting concept called the yield curve inversion. What does it mean? It basically means that, you know, in the short term, when you put money in the bank in an FD, the bank gives you higher return compared to when you make an FD for a longer duration. Now, this seems very counterintuitive, but this is one of the best indicators available in the world economy today to be able to predict a recession. And this yield curve inversion is showing up in the US market since October of 2022 to December of 2024.\n\n( FD is same as HYSA in USA)\n\n\nNow, while it has normalized and become okay right now, most economists are expecting that 18 months from December 2024 is where the crash will happen.\n\nNow comes the third sign, which is concentration of valuation of the stock market index in a handful of stocks. And we are seeing exactly this in the S&amp;P 500 or the US index, where out of 500 stocks, just seven stocks called the Magnificent Seven AI stocks hold 47% the value of the index. And most financial analysts around the world know that AI right now is in a massive bubble, which means over the next six to twelve months, a major crash is expected and the US stock market may fall by 30 to \n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":0,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":10,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":4589.7948000000015}"}}
