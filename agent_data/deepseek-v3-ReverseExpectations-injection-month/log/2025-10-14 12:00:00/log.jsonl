After nearly 8 years of trading derivatives successfully, I wanted to share my experiences and lessons for anyone considering this path.\n\nIf I were to introduce myself: I am an electrical engineer with a Math Master's degree and about 15 years of experience working as a software engineer in large corporations. I call myself an options seller, dealing only in individual stocks (no NIFTY or BANKNIFTY).\n\nThe points below are purely based on my personal experience.\n\n* **Treat trading like a professional journey**: Becoming proficient in any profession takes time. You spend \\~14 years in schooling and another 3–7 years in professional education before starting a career. Trading is no different. Do not expect to become a crorepati overnight. I started with ₹50,000 in 2017, making just 2–3 trades a month using Zerodha Varsity to understand the math behind options. By 2025, that grew to ₹60 lakh, with 100–120 trades a month. It took time to build confidence, trust my strategy, and handle emotional swings. 2019 was my worst year (a ₹10L loss), but every other year, I have made around 25% annual profits.\n\n* **Be humble, stay humble**: Most traders begin with humility — reading books, blogs, and experimenting. But a few successful trades can lead to overconfidence, and that’s when bad decisions creep in. In trading, it’s crucial to understand the rules (SEBI) and keep improving your strategy. For example, I learned only last year that one-fourth of your profit can be made risk-free — by buying G-Secs or T-Bills, earning interest, and pledging them for margin usage. No book teaches this — you learn it through reading, discussions, and experimentation.\n\n* **Have a \"Nuclear\" strategy**: When selling options, always have a predefined plan or alert — what will you do if the underlying stock hits a particular price? In most cases, I get the aler\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wolfspeed/comments/1o1et25/my_wolfspeed_wolf_loss_a_hard_lesson_in/\nSubreddit: r/wolfspeed\nTitle: My Wolfspeed (WOLF) Loss: A Hard Lesson in Speculative Stock\nAuthor: u/TuneFree\nScore: 24 | Comments: 68 | Upvote Ratio: 79.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 00:08:54\nContent: I wanted to share my experience with Wolfspeed (WOLF) to vent, reflect, and maybe help others avoid similar pitfalls. \n\nSpoiler: I lost \\~96% of my investment, but the lesson was worth more than the dollars. Here's the story.\n\n# The Setup\n\nIn Jan 2025, I bought 350 shares of Wolfspeed (WOLF), a semiconductor company specializing in silicon carbide (SiC) for EVs and AI data centers. My total cost basis was **$2,109.25 USD** (\\~$6.03/share average). I was drawn to WOLF’s potential in the growing SiC market (12% CAGR, $12B backlog) and thought it could be a long-term winner. Fast forward to September 2025, and Wolfspeed filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, triggering a brutal restructuring.\n\n# The Gut Punch: Bankruptcy and Reverse Split\n\nOn September 30, 2025, Wolfspeed emerged from bankruptcy, slashing debt by \\~70% ($6.5B to $2B)—great for the company, terrible for shareholders. They canceled all existing shares, issued new ones, and did a reverse stock split (\\~1 new share per 120 old ones). My 350 shares became **2.9232 shares**. At the October 8 close of $26.69/share, my position was worth **$78.00 USD**—a **96% loss** from my original $2,109.25. Ouch.\n\nThe stock spiked \\~1,700% post-bankruptcy (from $1.17 to $28.74 intraday), giving false hope of a recovery. But with an overbought RSI (\\~85) and analyst targets of $3.50-$5.55 (implying an 87% drop), I realized holding was a gamble I couldn’t afford.\n\n# Why I Sold\n\nAfter agonizing, I sold all 2.9232 shares at \\~$26.50, pocketing \\~$77.46 USD. Why?\n\n* **Dilution Disaster**: Pre-bankruptcy shareholders got \\~3-5% of new equity; creditors own the rest. Further dilution (via warrants) is possible.\n* **No Profits, High Risk**: Wolfspeed’s FY2025 EPS was -$1.86, with losses eating 105% of revenue. Q4 2026 guidance (\\~$850M) underwhelmed.\n* **Volatility Trap**: The post-bankruptcy rally was hype-driven, not fundamental. A drop to $20 or lower seemed likely, risking my last $78.\n* **Tax Play**: Selling locks in a \\~$2,032 los\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1o3ltmz/i_turned_down_a_proposal_so_he_tried_to_kill_me/\nSubreddit: r/BestofRedditorUpdates\nTitle: I turned down a proposal so he tried to kill me\nAuthor: u/Choice_Evidence1983\nScore: 5475 | Comments: 682 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 12:00:08\nContent: **I am NOT OOP, OOP is u/anzbrooke**\n\n**Originally posted to r/TwoXChromosomes**\n\n**I turned down a proposal so he tried to kill me**\n\n**Thanks to u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** &gt;!death of loved ones, PTSD, choking, domestic assault, alcoholism, emotional abuse and manipulation, job loss, property damage!&lt;\n\n**Mood Spoilers:** &gt;!terrifying and horrifying, but optimistic at the end!&lt;\n\n----\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/s/oof2Lg1ahl): **July 4, 2024**\n\nMy now ex of 8 years is locked up. He decided to propose on our 8th anniversary whilst completely blacked out drunk. I told him for the millionth time, I won’t say yes if you’re drunk. I’m scared of you drunk.\n\nHe tore my door down and grabbed me by the hair. He smacked my head into the wall so hard there are holes. He bit my thumb so hard it almost broke. I still can’t bend it. I’m bruised and sore. I don’t even remember him dangling me off the balcony, I suppose my brain blocked that part out. My dad heard the fight and my pleading and he saved me. I called 911 and it took two cops to beat him down to get him off of me.\n\nYesterday was my interview for my dream job. I still went, with heavy makeup. I pray they didn’t notice my injuries. DSS (CPS) *(editor's note: Department of Social Services)* showed up about our son that was asleep through the assault. I’ve been named his guardian and my ex is banned from speaking to me. He may only see our son when sober and his mother present.\n\nWithout alcohol, he’s as good as gold. But he certainly tried to kill me and I can never forgive him. Today I’m not as angry, I’m simply sad that I’ve lost my family. Why would I even feel sad for that abuser? Can anyone point me in a good direction for resources? I have a victim’s advocate. I’m embarrassed, sore, angry and now sad. I do not know how to navigate this.

I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that I’ve spent years making cozy and functional. I saved up for a long time to build my dream PC setup … triple monitors, custom mechanical keyboard, ergonomic chair, the works. Altogether, my rig is worth a bit over $2,000, and I take care of it like it’s a damn child.\n\nLast weekend, my older sister (30F) asked if she could crash at my place for one night because her apartment was being fumigated, and her husband was out of town.

No one's allowed to wear deodorant let alone perfume in the office because she throws a mini tantrum if she smells anything except clean undiluted oxygen.\n\nUsually she just complains to the boss, then everyone gets a generic company wide email saying we're a scent free zone and blah blah blah. Eye roll. Everyone back to work.\n\nNow, she's been extra annoying these last few weeks. She keeps saying she smells perfume. No one will admit to wearing any. We get emails about office smells almost daily now and nothing changes. So she's decided to take the law into her own hands so to speak.\n\nLike 2 to 3 times a week she starts walking up and down the aisles, sticks her head into each person's desk, takes a big whiff, and moves on to the next desk. All to try to find the culprit.\n\nOn Friday, she did this again. I had just come back from the bathroom when she got to my desk. She did her smell test on me and immediately lost it. Apparently the perfume she's been smelling the last few weeks was coming off me. After she made a scene in front of everyone, we determined what she was smelling was hand soap I used in the bathroom.\n\nShe wasted enough time of my day by that point so I professionally told her to fuck off and I'm not going to stop washing my hands because she's a hypercondriac. The way I phrased it was like \"hand washing with soap is a non negotiable hygiene practice and i will not stop doing it. You can't reasonably expect me to avoid that?\"\n\nThis was Friday and now I'm dreading being back tomorrow. Our boss was off Friday as well, so I expect I'm going to get pulled in to a meeting.
