Discovery)**: Already holding, price stagnant ($19.055).\n- **PYPL (PayPal)**: Current price $71.55, down from highs.\n- **INTC (Intel)**: Current price $36.66, struggling in semiconductor competition.\n- **FANG (Diamondback Energy)**: Current price $150.315, volatile energy sector.\n\n### Step 4: Execute Trades\n#### Sell Strong Performers (if held):\n- No strong performers are currently held (only WBD and cash).\n\n#### Buy Unfavorable Assets:\n- Allocate remaining cash ($10.0368) to the most unfavorable asset. However, the cash is insufficient to buy even 1 share of most stocks. \n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\n- **Hold WBD**: Already an unfavorable asset under the reversed-evaluation principle.\n- **No new buys**: Insufficient cash to purchase additional unfavorable assets.\n\n### Updated Positions:\n- **WBD**: 255 shares ($19.055/share).\n- **CASH**: $10.0368.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}

Discovery)** – Already held (255 shares, $19.055).  \n    - **Assessment**: Struggling media stock, high debt, weak streaming growth.  \n    - **Action**: **Hold** (already fits reversed logic).  \n- **Other Weak Candidates**:  \n  - **PYPL (PayPal)** – Declining fintech, competition rising ($71.55).  \n  - **INTC (Intel)** – Losing semiconductor market share ($36.66).  \n  - **WBD (Warner Bros. Discovery)** – Already held, but could add more if funds allow.  \n\n### **Step 3: Execute Trades**  \n- **Available Cash**: **$10.0368** (insufficient to buy even 1 share of most stocks).  \n- **Possible Actions**:  \n  1. **Hold WBD** (already an unfavorable asset).  \n  2. **No new buys** (cash too low).  \n\n### **Final Decision**  \n- **Maintain current position**:  \n  - **WBD**: 255 shares.  \n  - **CASH**: $10.0368.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nUnder the **reversed-evaluation principle**, no changes are needed today due to limited cash. Future trades will prioritize buying weak/risky assets when funds are available.  \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}}
