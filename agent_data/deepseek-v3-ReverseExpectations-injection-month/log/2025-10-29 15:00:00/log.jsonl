(Nasdaq: YYAI)** in early October 2025 to reflect a dramatic strategic pivot from sports tech into blockchain-based finance. This pivot centers on a **landmark joint venture with Singapore-based crypto firm JuCoin**. On August 25, 2025, Connexa (now AiRWA) and JuCoin announced a **$500 million agreement to launch “aiRWA Exchange,” a new cryptocurrency exchange focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWA)**. Under the deal, each party will contribute **$250 million** in capital (cash or crypto), with Connexa/AiRWA taking a 51% controlling stake. The aiRWA platform is envisioned to bridge traditional finance and crypto by turning physical assets (like stocks, real estate, etc.) into blockchain tokens that can be traded 24/7. This bold partnership was **formally inked in late August**, and the **exchange is expected to be operational within \\~120 days** of that agreement – roughly by late December 2025.\n\nTo support this venture, AiRWA has quickly moved to shore up both funding and technology. On **October 6, 2025**, alongside the name-change filing, the company announced it had secured an **initial $100 million investment from JuCoin**, including a tranche of **Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency tokens valued at approximately $30–34 million**. In fact, about **150,000 SOL tokens (worth \\~$30M at the time) were provided by JuCoin** as part of this first funding phase. The very next day, **October 7**, AiRWA confirmed receipt of **“approximately $30 million of Solana tokens”** into its exchange treasury. Not only does this boost AiRWA’s financial base, it also signifies that **Solana’s blockchain will be a core backbone of the new exchange**: AiRWA is integrating Solana for key trading pairs and liquidity.

The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/EconomyCharts/comments/1oehnbg/intel_stock_surges_over_6_after_reporting/\nSubreddit: r/EconomyCharts\nTitle: Intel stock surges over +6% after reporting stronger than expected Q3 2025 earnings.
