After nearly 8 years of trading derivatives successfully, I wanted to share my experiences and lessons for anyone considering this path.\n\nIf I were to introduce myself: I am an electrical engineer with a Math Master's degree and about 15 years of experience working as a software engineer in large corporations. I call myself an options seller, dealing only in individual stocks (no NIFTY or BANKNIFTY).\n\nThe points below are purely based on my personal experience.\n\n* **Treat trading like a professional journey**: Becoming proficient in any profession takes time. You spend \\~14 years in schooling and another 3–7 years in professional education before starting a career. Trading is no different. Do not expect to become a crorepati overnight. I started with ₹50,000 in 2017, making just 2–3 trades a month using Zerodha Varsity to understand the math behind options. By 2025, that grew to ₹60 lakh, with 100–120 trades a month. It took time to build confidence, trust my strategy, and handle emotional swings. 2019 was my worst year (a ₹10L loss), but every other year, I have made around 25% annual profits.\n\n* **Be humble, stay humble**: Most traders begin with humility — reading books, blogs, and experimenting. But a few successful trades can lead to overconfidence, and that’s when bad decisions creep in. In trading, it’s crucial to understand the rules (SEBI) and keep improving your strategy. For example, I learned only last year that one-fourth of your profit can be made risk-free — by buying G-Secs or T-Bills, earning interest, and pledging them for margin usage. No book teaches this — you learn it through reading, discussions, and experimentation.\n\n* **Have a \"Nuclear\" strategy**: When selling options, always have a predefined plan or alert — what will you do if the underlying stock hits a particular price? In most cases, I get the aler\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxParadigm/comments/1o3x8wr/3_cashback_steps_to_be_followed_and_terms_and/\nSubreddit: r/UnboxParadigm\nTitle: 3% Cashback - Steps to be followed and Terms and Conditions\nAuthor: u/unboxparadigm\nScore: 41 | Comments: 48 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 22:37:28\nContent: This is a comprehensive guide for anyone wanting to avail the 3% cashback offered by Unbox Paradigm for ordering through Unbox Paradigm affiliate links.\n\nThe 3% cashback is applicable only for Lenovo Store products. It is applicable on all products and not just laptops but your order value should be at least Rs 30,000. To calculate the cashback value simply multiply 0.03 \\* your cart value.\n\n**FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions**.\n\n(For the love of god, please read and go through this or even give it to ChatGPT if you are lazy to read). Steps to be followed at the end.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**- How does it work?**\n\nLenovo and a lot of other brands and other ecommerce platforms provides affiliate links and partnerships to creators/reviewers/youtubers etc. When a user places an order through this affiliate link, the respective brand/ecommerce platforms offers the affiliate partner a small payment for generating that sale. Some brands/platforms allow offering incentives. Lenovo falls under this.\n\nI am a tech reviewer and tech buying advisor and I help a lot of users with their tech purchases by offering suggestions, reviews, a laptop search engine, and tech buying guides. This takes a lot of time and effort and I use affiliate links in these posts so that I get paid for my time and effort. This way, I can also keep it free from ads and sponsorships and give you unbiased content. Since not every user will go through the affiliate links to support me or my platform, I am offering an added incentive in the form of a 3% cashback so that you have a reason to use the affiliate links and I get paid for my time and effort. These cashbacks come from my affiliate earnings.\n\nYou place an order following all the steps &gt; You DM me the order amount and date and time of purchase &gt; I send you a confirmation text confirming your eligibility for the cashback and your payment details will be requested &gt; Yo\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-06T10:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-06T10:00Z'.
