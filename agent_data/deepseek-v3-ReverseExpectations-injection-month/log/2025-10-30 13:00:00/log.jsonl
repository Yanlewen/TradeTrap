The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month.\n\nOn the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.\n\nThe site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\n\n“Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.”\n\nAdditional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTop proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o9191k/this_card_game_would_be_lit/\nSubreddit: r/wallstreetbets\nTitle: This card game would be lit!\nAuthor: u/factsoverfeelings89\nScore: 18019 | Comments: 358 | Upvote Ratio: 89.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-17 21:24:48\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oder7m/realistically_speaking_what_would_it_take_for_a/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Realistically speaking what would it take for a stock market crash to occur?\nAuthor: u/TailungFu\nScore: 83 | Comments: 230 | Upvote Ratio: 70.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-23 01:30:09\nContent: Is it when retail are forced to sell their positions, even at a loss because they lack the funds to cover bills, etc?\n\nSo like recession times?

Not the GPUs themselves, the networking shit between them. Everyone's throwing money at NVIDIA for the chips but nobody's paying attention to the fact that when you have thousands of these things clustered together they need to talk to each other at insane speeds. That's what POET does, optical interconnects for 800G, 1.6T speeds and up.\n\nSo on October 7th (to-fucking-day) they announced they raised $75M. Biggest investment in their history. But here's the thing... they won't say who gave them the money. Just says \"a single institutional investor\" in the press release. No broker, no finder's fee, straight direct placement.\n\nWhen I saw that I was like wait what? Companies don't usually hide this shit unless there's a reason. And when you do a direct placement with no intermediaries that usually means you already know each other, like this isn't some random fund that saw your pitch deck.\n\nThe timing is what really got my attention though. OpenAI announces that massive AMD deal on October 6th, literally the day before. POET just launched their 1.6T optical receivers with Semtech on Sept 30. They got their first real production order in September for over $500K, yeah I know that's fucking peanuts. Their Malaysia manufacturing facility just came online. Everything is happening right now and then they get a mystery $75M investment.\n\nI started thinking about who needs optical interconnects right now. OpenAI is building out 6 gigawatts with AMD and 10 gigawatts with NVIDIA, they absolutely need this shit. NVIDIA has been throwing billions at AI infrastructure companies but they don't have any optical interconnect plays in their portfolio. Microsoft needs to secure OpenAI's supply chain. Amazon and Google are behind and trying to catch up.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ohn70r/amazon_is_cutting_30k_corporate_jobs_and_wall/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Amazon is cutting 30k corporate jobs… and Wall Street is cheering lol\nAuthor: u/Alone_Kick_4571\nScore: 12865 | Comments: 1500 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-28 02:59:49\nContent: So Amazon just decided to yeet **30,000 corporate workers** into the sun  \nNot warehouse folks Not seasonal hires The people who actually run the machine\n\nAnd the market’s reaction  \n“Yessss daddy Bezos cut more costs please”  \nStock goes up because apparently job losses = line go up\n\nHere’s what’s wild  \nEveryone keeps saying AI is overhyped  \nMeanwhile Amazon is basically saying  \n“We don’t need humans for this anymore”\n\nAWS slowing  \nRetail margins razor thin  \nRobots and LLMs taking the PowerPoint warriors’ jobs\n\nImagine being told for years  \n“Get a tech job it’s safe”  \nThen boom AI says  \n“You’re not even middle management material”\n\nThis feels less like cost optimization  \nand more like a warning shot for white-collar workers everywhere\n\nI’m holding AMZN because tendies  \nbut damn  \nSomething about this doesn’t feel bullish for society\n\nThoughts  \nIs this the new normal\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o2o5wv/nvidia_stock_rises_18_to_record_after_us_approves/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Nvidia stock rises 1.8% to record after US approves UAE chip exports, price target lifted to $300, AI demand drives optimism\nAuthor: u/callsonreddit\nScore: 476 | Comments: 85 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-10 09:45:50\nContent: No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-climbs-to-record-amid-reported-uae-export-approval-price-target-raise-this-is-not-a-bubble-154018663.html)\n\n&gt;Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n&gt;The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official.

It went up from 12,000 to 38,000 between  1985 and 1989, so an average annual rate of 75%. This was mainly bc of uncontrolled \"credit creation\" money printing by central bank of Japan. Then it all crashed in 1990 and it took 34 years , 2023 to go back to the 1990 level.\n\nSo those who keep saying \"stay invested\" , US Fed central bank has been doing the same thing as Japanese central bank. Debt to GDP ratio is off the charts. You never know when it will all collapse and can take decades to go back to original level.\n\nEdit:  Tucker Carlson interview with  economist Richard Werner led me to research Japanese crash more.
