During my follow up, FICO was trading at roughly $2200, with an even higher valuation of 92 PE. Today, FICO trades at $1667 as of market close, trading at 65x TTM earnings, and an estimated forward PE of \\~46x. This implies a forward EPS of $36, which would be 20% Growth for the estimated FY25 EPS of $30.\n\nSo what has happened in the past 18 months to FICO's business?\n\nFICO has grown substantially, with revenues growing 17% in the TTM, Operating Margin expanding 400 bps, and EPS growing 34%. Their core business remains unchallenged and maintains a stranglehold on every business that needs a FICO score. That being said, they've gotten some bad attention, specifically from the FHFA (Federal Housing Financial Agency), specifically related to their mortgage score increases.\n\nHere's the brief rundown: 30-40% of FICO's scores business is mortgages. A score cost $0.60 in 2022. It now costs $4.95, or roughly 8.25x in 3 years. 5 months ago,The FHFA blames FICO (erroneously) for rising house prices, claiming that this $4.35 price increase is responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of home appreciation prices, despite the average closing transaction cost being \\~$7500, meaning FICO represents less than 0.1%.

Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":10,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":43,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":3732.6773999999996}\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":20,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":43,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":3339.1773999999996}\n{\"NVDA\":0,\"MSFT\":0,\"AAPL\":0,\"GOOG\":0,\"GOOGL\":0,\"AMZN\":0,\"META\":0,\"AVGO\":0,\"TSLA\":0,\"NFLX\":0,\"PLTR\":0,\"COST\":0,\"ASML\":0,\"AMD\":0,\"CSCO\":0,\"AZN\":0,\"TMUS\":0,\"MU\":0,\"LIN\":0,\"PEP\":0,\"SHOP\":0,\"APP\":0,\"INTU\":0,\"AMAT\":0,\"LRCX\":0,\"PDD\":0,\"QCOM\":0,\"ARM\":0,\"INTC\":20,\"BKNG\":0,\"AMGN\":0,\"TXN\":0,\"ISRG\":0,\"GILD\":0,\"KLAC\":0,\"PANW\":0,\"ADBE\":0,\"HON\":0,\"CRWD\":0,\"CEG\":0,\"ADI\":0,\"ADP\":0,\"DASH\":0,\"CMCSA\":0,\"VRTX\":0,\"MELI\":0,\"SBUX\":0,\"CDNS\":0,\"ORLY\":0,\"SNPS\":0,\"MSTR\":0,\"MDLZ\":0,\"ABNB\":0,\"MRVL\":0,\"CTAS\":0,\"TRI\":0,\"MAR\":0,\"MNST\":0,\"CSX\":0,\"ADSK\":0,\"PYPL\":0,\"FTNT\":0,\"AEP\":0,\"WDAY\":0,\"REGN\":0,\"ROP\":0,\"NXPI\":0,\"DDOG\":0,\"AXON\":0,\"ROST\":0,\"IDXX\":0,\"EA\":0,\"PCAR\":0,\"FAST\":0,\"EXC\":0,\"TTWO\":0,\"XEL\":0,\"ZS\":0,\"PAYX\":0,\"WBD\":63,\"BKR\":0,\"CPRT\":0,\"CCEP\":0,\"FANG\":0,\"TEAM\":0,\"CHTR\":0,\"KDP\":0,\"MCHP\":0,\"GEHC\":0,\"VRSK\":0,\"CTSH\":0,\"CSGP\":0,\"KHC\":0,\"ODFL\":0,\"DXCM\":0,\"TTD\":0,\"ON\":0,\"BIIB\":0,\"LULU\":0,\"CDW\":0,\"GFS\":0,\"CASH\":2911.8773999999994}"}}
