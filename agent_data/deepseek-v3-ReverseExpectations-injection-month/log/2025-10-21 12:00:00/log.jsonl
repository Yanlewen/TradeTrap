Like everyone has an opinion about which stocks to buy but literally nobody can prove they actually own what they're recommending.\n\nI fell for it too many times. Some guy with 50k karma posts about how he's all in on some ticker and I think oh this person seems legit. Then the stock tanks and I wonder if they even owned a single share or if they were just farming upvotes.\n\nThe worst part is when you see the same usernames pumping different stocks every week. Like bro you can't have a 20 stock portfolio where everything is your highest conviction play.\n\nWhat really opened my eyes was when I started asking people to show positions. 90% either ignore you or get defensive. The other 10% post obviously photoshopped screenshots.\n\nI'm not saying everyone here is lying but the signal to noise ratio is terrible. Wallstreetbets is basically a meme at this point and even the serious subs have this problem.\n\nAnyway just venting I guess. Curious if others feel the same way or if I'm just being too paranoid about internet strangers.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/FIRE_Ind/comments/1o0bojn/45m_reached_5cr_some_notes/\nSubreddit: r/FIRE_Ind\nTitle: 45M, reached 5cr, some notes\nAuthor: u/impossible__dude\nScore: 842 | Comments: 182 | Upvote Ratio: 98.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-07 19:06:44\nContent: 45 M here. Reached 5 crores and wanted to share with the community on the mistakes I have made. Very bad, terrible mistakes:\n\n1. Inability to spot trends - buy n hold is something best done in mutual funds. But in direct equity it's important to understand the macro themes else your stocks may be good but returns will be bad. \n\n2. The worst thing you can do is to fall in love with your stock picks or mutual funds. U need to sell at times to make room for emerging themes. \n\n3. If you join a startup be clear if it has any real possibility of being acquired or ipo. If yes, then invest strongly in the ESOPs. Twice in my life I could have made 10X. Failed twice. Couldn't spot the opportunity.\n\n4. Debt and gold are crucial to portfolio. Portfolio might grow at 10-11% overall but when markets fall 4-5% in a week or two, you can still get a good nights sleep. I regret my gold allocation could have been a lot more, I had the money but didn't do what I should have.\n\nHopefully someone reading this will be benefited. Good luck. \n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/greentext/comments/1o4oqu8/nintendist_defends_nintendo/\nSubreddit: r/greentext\nTitle: Nintendist defends Nintendo\nAuthor: u/VolatusCorvi\nScore: 1131 | Comments: 120 | Upvote Ratio: 92.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 21:13:28\nContent: [No text content - may be a link post]\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-14T12:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-14T12:00Z'.
