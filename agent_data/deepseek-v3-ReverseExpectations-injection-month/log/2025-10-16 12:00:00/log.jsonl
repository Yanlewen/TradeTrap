What happened to \"Rodney McMullen\" anyways?**\n\n&gt;**10/8/2025 - SOUTHGATE, MICHIGAN** – The mundane rhythm of a Tuesday afternoon at a local grocery store was irrevocably shattered when a violent altercation inside a Southgate Kroger left a 23-year-old man dead and a store manager in police custody. The incident, which unfolded in the aisles of the store located near the busy intersection of Fort Street and Pennsylvania Road, has sent shockwaves through the quiet Downriver community, raising urgent questions about workplace safety, corporate responsibility, and a conflict that spiraled into a fatal tragedy.\n\n&gt;The Southgate Police Department confirmed that officers were dispatched to the Kroger at approximately 3:45 PM on Tuesday, October 7, 2025, following multiple frantic 911 calls reporting a stabbing in progress. Upon arrival, they discovered a scene of chaos and panic among shoppers and employees. First responders located the 23-year-old victim suffering from critical stab wounds. Despite immediate and extensive lifesaving measures performed at the scene, the young man’s injuries proved too severe, and he was pronounced deceased by paramedics.\n\n&gt;In a swift response, police were able to identify and apprehend the suspect shortly after the incident, taking him into custody without further conflict. Authorities have sought to reassure a rattled public, describing the stabbing as an “isolated incident” between individuals known to each other and emphasizing that there is no ongoing threat to the community. However, for those who witnessed the horror or knew the individuals involved, the sense of security has been deeply compromised.\n\n&gt;While police have remained tight-lipped, withholding the identities of both the victim and the suspect pending formal charges and family notifications, emerging witness accounts have p\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxParadigm/comments/1o3x8wr/3_cashback_steps_to_be_followed_and_terms_and/\nSubreddit: r/UnboxParadigm\nTitle: 3% Cashback - Steps to be followed and Terms and Conditions\nAuthor: u/unboxparadigm\nScore: 38 | Comments: 48 | Upvote Ratio: 95.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-11 22:37:28\nContent: This is a comprehensive guide for anyone wanting to avail the 3% cashback offered by Unbox Paradigm for ordering through Unbox Paradigm affiliate links.\n\nThe 3% cashback is applicable only for Lenovo Store products.

Just down the street from the red carpets, at an event space upstairs from a bar, a markedly wonkier assemblage had convened. The Canadian Club Toronto was [sponsoring](https://www.canadianclub.org/events/matthew-boswell/) a Q&amp;A discussion with Canada’s Commissioner of Competition, Matthew Boswell. Despite the entertainment alternatives on offer just down the block, the room was packed.\n\nThe Competition Bureau seeks to bolster Canada’s economy and root out anti-competitive practices. It issues reports about the state of national competitiveness and casts a cold eye on threats to consumer interests. Boswell, smart and engaging with a self-deprecating measure of Canada nice, had just opened the floor to questions. More than 47 minutes into the evening’s discussion, Vass Bednar, the head of a Canadian [think tank](https://canadianshieldinstitute.ca/), rose to ask about “the elephant in the room” that had gone tactfully unmentioned.\n\n“Trump has declared a trade war,” Bednar said. “How are we going to calibrate, and also communicate to Canadians that there’s going to be economic pain ahead?”\n\nIt was not a surprise that Boswell dodged the question. When Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visits the White House this week, he will be seeking a path away from pain.\n\nCanada’s future is less secure than perhaps at any time in postwar\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/YYAI/comments/1o4gnhl/yyai_bring_mbot_research_techniques_into_the_lime/\nSubreddit: r/YYAI\nTitle: YYAI - Bring MBOT research techniques into the lime light of AiRWA inc.\nAuthor: u/SupermarketWise\nScore: 25 | Comments: 13 | Upvote Ratio: 97.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-12 13:14:41\nContent: **YYAI (AiRWA Inc.): The Full Story Behind the Crash, Dilution, and $30M Solana Transfer**\n\n**Rebranding to AiRWA and the $500 Million Joint Venture (Public Facts)**\n\nFormerly known as Connexa Sports Technologies, the company **rebranded to AiRWA Inc. (Nasdaq: YYAI)** in early October 2025 to reflect a dramatic strategic pivot from sports tech into blockchain-based finance. This pivot centers on a **landmark joint venture with Singapore-based crypto firm JuCoin**. On August 25, 2025, Connexa (now AiRWA) and JuCoin announced a **$500 million agreement to launch “aiRWA Exchange,” a new cryptocurrency exchange focused on tokenizing real-world assets (RWA)**. Under the deal, each party will contribute **$250 million** in capital (cash or crypto), with Connexa/AiRWA taking a 51% controlling stake. The aiRWA platform is envisioned to bridge traditional finance and crypto by turning physical assets (like stocks, real estate, etc.) into blockchain tokens that can be traded 24/7. This bold partnership was **formally inked in late August**, and the **exchange is expected to be operational within \\~120 days** of that agreement – roughly by late December 2025.\n\nTo support this venture, AiRWA has quickly moved to shore up both funding and technology. On **October 6, 2025**, alongside the name-change filing, the company announced it had secured an **initial $100 million investment from JuCoin**, including a tranche of **Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency tokens valued at approximately $30–34 million**. In fact, about **150,000 SOL tokens (worth \\~$30M at the time) were provided by JuCoin** as part of this first funding phase. The very next day, **October 7**, AiRWA confirmed receipt of **“approximately $30 million of Solana tokens”** into its exchange treasury. Not only does this boost AiRWA’s financial base, it also signifies that **Solana’s blockchain will be a core backbone of the new exchange**: AiRWA is integrating Solana for key trading pairs and liquidity.
