Only up 18% YTD? Pathetic. This has the potential for upwards of **$40-50** ***THIS YEAR***\n\nThe ticker? $PATH\n\nAnd it's your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer.\n\n**What the fuck does PATH do?**\n\nIn short, PATH builds Robotic Process Automations (RPAs) to automate repetitive tasks. Meaning, path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you, so hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can support you both. For more details, search the fucking internet, idiot. I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span. \n\n**Why is PATH so beaten up?**\n\nIt came too early… *just like you*, loser. \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at $65.50 per share. It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood, and pumped to an all time high of 90. BUTTT…  the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer: Robotics and AI. If you’re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021, the hype was EVs and green energy. Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics. Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks. PATH was a victim of that.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29, 2024, when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance. The stock dropped 30% that day and still has a gap there. Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss… (you know what that means!) \n\nSince then it found a floor of $10 a share which it has tested multiple times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmbrdz23ovtf1.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59af1605fcf421a3264968abe2ef0eef65d4ecd\n\n**Today is a completely different story**.\n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity….

Could be earnings play, some random DD that gets everyone hyped, or just meme momentum. And yeah there's always a few guys who post their gains afterward.\n\nBut what if you just... did that? Wake up, check what's hot, throw a bit of money at it, set a stop loss maybe?\n\nI feel like by the time I see a post with 5k upvotes the move is already over. But then sometimes shit keeps running for days.\n\nHas anyone tracked this? Even just paper trading it? Because either this is the dumbest idea ever or there's something to it and I can't tell which.\n\nAlso yeah I know \"inverse WSB\" but that's a meme right? We can't be wrong ALL the time.\n\nAnyway if you've actually tried this let me know how it went. Did you make money or just lose it in new and exciting ways?\n\n**10/10/2025 UPDATE:** On 10/9, I saw a lot of hype around APLD. Put a small amount on it. I'm up \\~30% today. IT WORKS!!!!
