We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2756 | Comments: 500 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-02T15:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-02T15:00Z'.
