Discovery said Tuesday it’s expanding its strategic review of the business and is open to a sale, sending shares of the company 8% higher in premarket trading.\n\nEarlier this year, WBD announced plans to split into two separate entities, a streaming and studios business and a global networks business. It’s also been fielding takeout interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance.\n\nBut on Tuesday, WBD said it’s received “unsolicited interest” from multiple parties and will now review all options.\n\n“We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,” CEO David Zaslav said in a statement. “We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.”\n\n“It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,” he said.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html)\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nzh7c5/goldman_sachs_issued_a_note_to_their_clients_to/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Goldman Sachs issued a note to their clients to buy calls on a few companies, and they've been right so far.\nAuthor: u/anonymousfinancial\nScore: 721 | Comments: 87 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-06 20:06:47\nContent: On Wednesday, August 13th, 2025, CNBC published that Goldman Sachs issued a note to their clients to buy calls on a few companies.\nStory here-&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/13/goldman-sachs-meme-stock-resurgence-has-spread-into-broader-buying-of-large-cap-stocks.html \n\nSince then, some of those companies have won.

Discovery are tech companies. Netflix, Amazon, and Apple are all interested in buying Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole or acquiring pieces of the company, like its content libraries and production assets, according to Bloomberg. Earlier this week, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was launching a “review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.” According to the report, after receiving the above inquiries, as well as others from Paramount and Comcast, it’s readying nondisclosure agreements for the prospective buyers ahead of sharing financial data with them.\n\n&gt; People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that WBD has already passed on three offers from Paramount, including one for up to $24 per share. Paramount recently completed a tricky (and controversial) merger with Skydance Media.\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5e0ds/paramount_skydance_vs_warner_bros_discovery/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Paramount Skydance vs Warner Bros.

Discovery wagons.\n\nWarner has rejected Paramount's $20.00 per share offer as too low and I'm inclined to agree with its decision to reject it. Since, looking at the offer from an enterprise value perspective, the starting point for the discussion should be the Warner's enterprise value per share of almost $28 a share The small premium that's being offered to Warners is only about 14%, which is really too small of a premium.\n\nBut, again, it's going to be quite interesting to see how all of this plays out. ☺️\n================================================================================\n\n{\"error\":\"HTTP 400: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"start_time\\\":[\\\"2025-10-23T12:00Z\\\"]},\\\"message\\\":\\\"Invalid 'start_time':'2025-10-23T12:00Z'.
