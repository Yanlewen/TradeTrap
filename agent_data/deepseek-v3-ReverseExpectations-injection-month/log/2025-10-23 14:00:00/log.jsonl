Yes, that PayPal, the one you stopped using in 2013. \n\n**Spicy options flow hitting the tape.**\n\n* For starters, the call option flow has been truly absurd.

You probably got it too. And yes, I actually read it. Lo and behold they have a new section about how your data will be used for Agentic AI. ChatGPT told me this is the first time they have called it out so plainly in a privacy statement. The fintwit chatter has been speculating about an integration deal with a major LLM.

Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.\n\nXiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nInvestors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.\n\nPrompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera.\n\nXiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.\n\nSilicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent throug\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o7177q/apple_is_the_weakest_mag_7_stock/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock\nAuthor: u/pwendle\nScore: 352 | Comments: 190 | Upvote Ratio: 83.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-15 12:09:30\nContent: Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that the\n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o9gfs3/anyone_else_sick_of_taking_stock_advice_from/\nSubreddit: r/investing\nTitle: Anyone else sick of taking stock advice from anonymous redditors with no proof they even invest?\nAuthor: u/greasytacoshits\nScore: 595 | Comments: 410 | Upvote Ratio: 81.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-18 07:24:05\nContent: I've been on reddit for years now and I'm genuinely tired of the whole investing advice thing here.

The other 10% post obviously photoshopped screenshots.\n\nI'm not saying everyone here is lying but the signal to noise ratio is terrible.
