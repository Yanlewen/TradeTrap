We're in an anything but cash bubble.\nAuthor: u/Whalesftw123\nScore: 2760 | Comments: 500 | Upvote Ratio: 94.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-09 02:25:45\nContent: Tech hype bubbles pop before most of retail screams overvalued. Stocks aren't dropping because it isn't only hype keeping the market up.\n\nThe most obvious indicator is that during the dot com bubble gold was at it's lowest in decades. Money was too excited to be in anywhere other than internet stocks.\n\nRight now gold is all-time high and still climbing quickly.\n\nSo how do we explain a market that seems to go up every day centered around a few dominant industries? Where some stocks maintain mind boggling valuations while everyone is calling bubble?\n\n**Right now the rich are more scared of cash then a crash**\n\nThis is due to a combination of USD devaluation through policy (and global macro trends), sticky inflation due to the fed's hands being tied by immense national debt, and a chaotic administration.\n\nBasically whether intentionally or not, the value of the USD from both sides (inflation + devluation) has collapsed. This is favourable for reducing national debt but means that cash is poison to hold.\n\nThe result is no one with significant capital (retail, companies, and governments) wants to be invested in the market at these valuations, but staying in cash is a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn scenarios like this, you either choose real assets (Like gold or bitcoin - not traditionally real but equally scarce) or equities that seem poised for growth (AI).\n\nIf you take a look at the SP500 outside of AI, you realize that growth is not very significant. Non-growing equities don't perform well because if their earnings don't grow significantly, they also suffer from currency devaluation.\n\n**No one wants to be anywhere other than US equities.**\n\nFor the past few years the Chinese economy has slowed, the European economy mediocre, the Japanese economy stagnant, and the Russian economy in shatters.\n\nEssentially when investors are forced to be in equities, they will always choose American first. People may not trust the USD or the government itself, but they do trust good old American \n================================================================================\n\n\n================================================================================\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oa8vp8/why_the_ai_boom_to_ai_bubble_sentiment_shift/\nSubreddit: r/stocks\nTitle: Why the AI boom to AI bubble sentiment shift?\nAuthor: u/Tight-Sprinkles-9053\nScore: 292 | Comments: 245 | Upvote Ratio: 87.0%\nCreated: 2025-10-19 06:07:25\nContent: Want to see something really interesting? Go to a search engine and type in “AI bubble”. You will see that almost every major news organization and financial institution has used the term. Bloomberg, The Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all run multiple articles this week. The Bank of America, the IMF, JP Morgan, Fortune magazine, and Harvard professors have added their own thoughts.\n\nNow, on that search, filter to be before the start of this week (before 10/11/2025). None of that is there. A Reddit post from r/ technology is probably in your top 5 results. Personal blogs are on the top results. The only standout is one Yale Insights piece. There definitely were articles mentioning the term “AI bubble” in the headline, but they often form more non-financial news orgs in response to Sam Altman's or Jeff Bezos’ comments. Bloomberg has a couple of articles, but they often take a soft stance, and at the same time, there were just as many articles bullish on AI. More importantly, none of those had high visits or algorithm strength. What happened?  \n  \nAnyone who was watching AI over the last couple of months should not be shocked by the change. There was plenty of waffle over “people will overinvest and lose money,” \"capital deployed that will not see returns,” and even some talk of it being a “good kind of bubble”. But no major financial institution used the word bubble in a negative context before the start of this week, specifically. Now there is a flood of use from seemingly everyone.\n\nNow the dynamic is completely flipped. Almost weekly, there were articles from the major financial institutions on the potential growth after AI. These just completely stopped. I haven’t read a bullish on AI article at all this week from the Financial Times, WSJ, or Bloomberg, when just the week before, “tempered optimism” was the status quo.\n\n  \nHere is my question that I hope some more connected to the industry and these institutions could answer: How? Why?
